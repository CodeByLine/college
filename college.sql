('home', 243854, 303066, 42424, 7529, '\nAbbot\'s Update #1: “<i>Memento Mori</i>”\n\nI would like to spend the rest of my life in meditation and contemplation, talking and listening to the Divine. The focus of my efforts would be to understand consciousness, the Daimon, and death, <i>memento mori</i>. In order to enhance and preserve the purity of this focus I would need to retire from my positions as Director of the Stoic Registry and Scholarch of the College of Stoic Philosophers. Afterwards, my principle attachment to the Stoic world would be as Abbot of the monastery, here with you, where I would remain indefinitely.\n\nI will retire as Director of the Registry this May, the 25th anniversary of the community. I have found the new Director, and he has agreed to assume his responsibilities in May. I would retire as Scholarch of the College this July, the 13th anniversary. At least, that is my intention. I have someone in mind for the position, but they have not yet agreed to take over.\n\nCreating and managing wealth is an important life lesson for some people. My brother, the “successful” one in the family, is one of these. For me it was soul evolution and service to humanity without remuneration. I didn\'t actually plan it ahead of time; that is simply how Fate and I worked it out over my lifetime.\n\nI have a number of ideas for the monastery that will bring a clearer vision  of who we are and where we are going, but they will be taken up later when I am able to be more available. Right now, I am so busy with my duties at the College it may appear I am absent and ignoring you. I assure you that I am not. I am always with you in spirit and in my daily meditations.\n\nHave a great week.\n\nA. Erik\n<<>>\n');

How long you have been interested in Stoicism. \r\nI am not sure when I first came across Stoicism.  Most likely in college, and in general reading post college.  I became strongly interested in it after reading Tom Wolfe\'s A Man In Full in 1999.  I subsequently read a large number of Stoic books, both original and commentaries (see answer #2).  It was around 2002 that I adopted it as my main life philosophy, my approach to leading the best life possible for me.  \r\n\r\n2. Any books you read on Stoic philosophy. If any, please list them. \r\nI have read a large number of Stoic books, and continually try to make progress in controlling impressions, but find that I eventually lose focus in my day-to-day life.  I especially liked William Irvine\'s books which are some of the most recent ones I have read.  Specifically, my Stoic library currently consists of the following books:\r\n\r\no Marcus Aurelius, Meditations (2 translations: George Lang and C. Scot Hicks)\r\no Lawrence Becker, A New Stoicism\r\no Tad Brennan, The Stoic Life: Emotions, Duties, and Fate\r\no Epictetus, Discourses and Handbook (2 Translantions: George Lang and Robin Hard)\r\no Victor Frankl, Man\'s Search For Meaning (not sure that this is really Stoic)\r\no John Sellars, Stoicism (on order for this course)\r\no William B. Irvine A Guide to the Good Life: The Ancient Art of Stoic Joy\r\no William B. Irvine On Desire: Why We Want What We Want \r\no Cynthia King Musonius Rufus: Lectures and Sayings  \r\no A.A. Long, Epictetus: A Stoic and Socratic Guide to Life \r\no Tom Morris, The Art of Stoic Living\r\no Seneca, Letters from a Stoic (Translation: Robin Campbell)\r\no Keith Seddon, Stoic Serenity: A Practical Course on Finding Inner Peace\r\no James B. Stockdale, Thoughts of a Philosophical Fighter Pilot (not yet read)\r\n\r\n3. Would you call yourself an atheist, agnostic/skeptic, deist, theist? \r\nI would have called myself a number of these things at different times.  In moving away from the organized religion of my upbringing (see answer #4) I moved to being a very strong atheist.  Later I moved more towards an agnostic or skeptic philosophy.  Lately I have more leanings towards their being some spiritual entity in the universe.  I doubt this entity is an all-powerful creator, or intervenes in a supernatural way.  Nor do I see them taking much interest in human in general or individuals, so it does not make sense to worship or pray to them.  I do not believe in an afterlife.  I have a strong aversion to organized religions because of too much hypocrisy, and arguing over details that do not really matter in the great scheme of things.  I have studied a great deal of science, but still do not see it having all ofthe answers.  I ready Stephen Hawking\'s newest book The Grand Design and remained unconvinced that "proved" that God does not exist.\r\n\r\n4. Are you a member of a religious faith? If so, which and for how long? \r\nI am not currently a member of any religious faith.  I was raised as a Lutheran, and attended parochial school from Kindergarten through High School with church attendance every Sunday.  I discontinued regular church attendance gradually during my college years at Ball State University.  I have studied most of the world\'s great religions, not finding any that seem to work for me.  Buddhism does hold some appeal to me from a general spirituality standpoint.\r\n\r\n5. Have you studied philosophies other than Stoicism? If so, which? \r\nI have studied Philosophy in general, and hopefully touched on all the main ones.  The writings of Mortimer Adler were my entry to the study of philosophy.  I have read heavily in classical philosophy: Aristotle, Plato, Epictetus, Aurelius, Lucretius, Epicurus, and Augustine.  My reading of more modern philosophers has been more through interpretations rather than the originals.  However, I have read a number of works by Locke, Montaigne, and Nietzsche.  I have also enjoyed Robert Solomon\'s books, and lectures for The Teaching Company.\r\n\r\nI became interested in philosophy in general in high school when my father bought a set of the Great Books of the Western World.  I embarked on the 10-year reading plan, not getting very far.  However, I was fascinated with the Greek philosophers and their search for how best to live the good life.  I embarked on reading as much about philosophy as I could find.  I especially used Mortimer Adler\'s writing as help for learning about philosophy in general.  In college I became fascinated with Ayn Rand first through her novels.  I later read much of her non-fiction work as well.\r\n\r\n6. Do you consider yourself to be a Stoic? \r\nI certainly do not consider myself a Stoic sage.  I find Stoicism to be the most consistent with my life experience and desired approach to life.  I believe continued progress towards becoming a Stoic sage will lead to a more tranquil and happy life. I continue to have difficulty controlling my anger and frustrations regarding other people and the impressions I allow them to make on me.  I still have a tendency to worry about things that are out of my control, although I have made progress on this.  I think I have made the most progress on the physical side, I have taught myself to accept bodily discomforts (hunger, heat/cold, physical strain) and have gained confidence in myself, my body, and increased my strength and endurance as a result.  I take my own physical fitness very seriously, and devote a significant amount of thought, time and energy to it.  \r\n\r\n7. What you want to get from this course? \r\nMy main objective would be to be more consistent in my practical application of Stoicism.  I would also like to reinforce and refine what I have already learned in my independent studies.  I think the discipline of assignments and course work will enhance my learning and keep me on track.  I very much like the idea of creating a mnene that will help me remember my practice.  I do not consider myself much of a writer and especially not a poet, so I look forward to the challenge of this assignment.', 1, '', 0, 0, 0, '', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', 1, 0, '', ''),

I look forward to corresponding with you.', 'I was born with a birth defect called Spina Bifida which has for most of my life kept me indoors. Also, my hometown at the time was a very small and so there was not much a disabled boy could do. As a child I was not able to play with the other children so I turned to books. This turned out to be a blessing in disguise, because with books I was able to learn about the world outside my little town. I was also able to learn about many different cultures, opinions, customs, ways of life, and so on. I was also raised as a Roman Catholic in that small town, but was not very satisfied with the philosophy of life they were giving me.\r\n \r\nI eventually moved to a larger town in Texas while entering high school. While in high school I met a very good friend who also shared my passion for knowledge and learning. He did not have the severe health problems that I did, but his health problems also kept him in his home or in some library on most occasions. This friend introduced me to philosophy. My Catholicism was already starting to fade at this time as I was then a gnostic at the very least.\r\n\r\nAfter several conversations with my friend we began questioning all variety of things in life, from the meaning of life, the shortness of it, whether there was in fact a god or not, and what did this all mean. I eventually lost all my religious faith and realized I was an atheist one summer. I believe at this point I began to intensify my reading of philosophy as well as my discussion of philosophy topics with any and everybody I could contact! I was thirsty for knowledge and wisdom and so philosophy provided that knowledge to feed that desire. I realized that the conventional way of looking at things from the perspective of my family\'s Catholicism was not satisfying to me. Perhaps it is helpful for other people, but I was not finding any satisfaction from it. \r\n\r\nWith my increasing questions my friend from high school began to recommend books to me that would help satisfy my curiosity. For instance, on my 18th birthday I felt I was in my prime and was very much inclined towards individualism. I think at this time I was beginning to accept my disability to such an extent that I no longer felt sorry for myself for being born disabled. I wondered how much a man could become an individualist and what this would entail. So my friend recommended some works by Objectivist philosopher Ayn Rand. In particular I like the book/movie The Fountainhead. What I learned from this bit of philosophy is how one can become heroic by standing up for what you believe in and especially never change your core values just because somebody in society does not like what your values are, or wants you to change into something of his making. While I no longer consider myself an Objectivist I learned many values that I still carry with me. I think the value of the individual as well as the rigorous self-examination of one\'s values and ethics is something I also agree with and think has something in common with the Stoics. \r\n\r\nAround my 20th birthday I asked him about the absurdity in the world and how a philosopher would deal with such absurdity. In response he recommended I read Existentialist philosophers, and in particular Albert Camus. I read all of his books including his essay on The Myth of Sisyphus. The essay on Sisyphus sticks in my mind because there is something heroic about taking on the absurd in the universe. Not just taking on the absurd task but embracing it, so that one can find a special kind of meaning even in suffering. I think perhaps at least in Camus\' works there are some similarities between Existentialism and Stoicism. Again, I think the embracing of suffering and finding meaning when life is often quite absurd is something Existentialists and certainly the Stoics had in mind when they lived on this earth. \r\n\r\nSo eventually I took my departure from Existentialism. I learned all I think I needed to learn from these great philosophers. I credit them with many great personal revelations, but there was still something quite missing. The Existentialists raised a lot of questions for me personally and I again wanted more knowledge of philosophy and how to live the good life. \r\n\r\nA few years later at the age of 25 I was about to go into graduate school for applied psychology. In my undergraduate years I read some philosophy here and there and then I talked with many people at my university and then of course all over the Internet. Keep in mind, there was and is no philosophy department at my university. This is unfortunate, but I was at least able to take an ethics and logic course while at a junior college. Psychology is for me a second passion in life besides philosophy, so I just went with that.\r\n\r\nDuring my graduate years I had to stop my philosophy studies for a time so that I could intensely concentrate on my psychology learning in graduate school. Despite the absence philosophy still beckoned in the back of my mind, and the questions that were still left unanswered for me. \r\n\r\nAfter getting my MA in Applied Psychology in 2009 at the age of 29, I found myself taking a much deserved victory vacation in the great islands of Hawaii. While still there in Hawaii my friend emailed me some Stoic writings he thought I would enjoy. At the time I did not think of myself as a Stoic until I read such works as Marcus Aurelius Antoninus\' Meditations and then Lucius Annaeus Seneca\'s On the Shortness of Life. It was then I realized that the Stoics had a lot in common with me and that I do consider myself a student of Stoicism.\r\n\r\nWhat I would like to get out of this course is:\r\nHow do I apply Stoicism to various areas of my life, including relationships, career, and dealing with others?\r\nI recently became a Secular Humanist Chaplin and would like know how Stoic teachings can help me in volunteering to help people as a secular Chaplin.', 1, '', 0, 0, 0, '', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', 1, 0, '', ''),

I have had an interest in religion and philosophy for as long as I can remember. I was raised in a Baptist Christian household and introduced to religious concepts early in life. Around the age of thirteen I questioned the divinity of Christ and started to look at other religious traditions. At this time I was introduced to the Islamic faith. I followed a traditional sect of Sunni Islam, know as ahlu-sunna wal-jamaat for about twenty years. I became discouraged and questioned much of the theology and the authenticity of the Islamic holy book.\r\n\r\n      I began to question whether the Quran was the actual word of  Allah (God) , received by Muhammad through divine revelation and then he spread the message to humanity. I thought that this belief lack logic and reason and I could no longer continue on this path.Furthermore, the Quran was considered infallible, but not only was the book infallible anyone interpreting the book strongly believed that their interpretation was also infallible. \r\n\r\n     For me, this type of theology became less about the growth of the individual and more about the importance and position of the particular religious leader(s).\r\n\r\nMy search for awakening and transformation continued and lead me to the study of sufism and eventually to Buddhism. I studied Buddism for two and a half years and learned quite a bit,  The focus of study was mainly on the basics of buddhism, the four noble truths, eight fold path and six paramitas. The Zen temple I studied relied heavily on meditation practice. The major issue  I encountered was often felling like a second class practitioner. Someone who could never really reach nirvana because I was a householder, and not a monk. The temple was affiliated with Taiwan and having Chinese influence, pushed a very strict vegetarian diet. Although never said the implication was that one must be a monk and a vegetarian in order to reach full enlightenment.\r\n\r\n     The vegetarian diet was said to be an act of  compassion and by  adopting a vegetarian diet, one is showing compassion to other sentient beings. I ask if the same compassion is afforded to living plants and living micro organisms that are killed during the harvesting, cleaning and cooking of the  vegetables. The answer was that in Chinese Buddhism compassion equals vegetarianism, and that was the end of the conversations. I continue to sit meditation with the group but I no longer take courses at the temple I thought I was forced to adapt a culture, tradition and rituals that were foreign to me and difficult to practice. \r\n\r\n     Moreover, many of the rituals could not be explained logically and did not have a direct correlation to spiritual development. Recently, I was introduced to the Stoic philosophers while searching Deism on the net and decided to take the search further. I started with reading Meditations  by Marcus Aurelius, I found the New Stoa website and glanced through all of the ebooks as well as watch the YouTube videos, I was hooked.I felt as though I have found exactlly what I am looking for- a system to help me navigate this life and live according to nature.\r\n\r\n     I have been involved in interfaith dialogue for about three years now and I think that stoicism could be a bridge between people of different faiths.  Stoicism offers many of the values and ethics that religious folk are looking for without all of the dogma of hate, guilt and commercialism that is often associated with the church, temple and mosque today. Marcus Aurelius reminds us "first of all, be untroubled in your mind; for all things come about as universal nature would have them... He continues to say "keep your eyes fixed on the matter in hand and see it as it really is, remembering that it is YOUR duty to be a good person(8.5)." (Hard,1997)\r\n\r\n      This resonated with me and was so refreshing to hear. In a nut shell, we are responsible for our actions. The devil didn\'t make us do it and our  goodness is not  connected to our being "anointed" therefore, all can be good or bad based solely one how one chooses to react on ones passions. There are no chosen people and you need not pay the minister 10% in order to be blessed and thus favored by the lord. Stoicism allows one to gain gain a spiritual awakening in the purest sense, through the examination of self.\r\n\r\n     Today, I would consider myself a Deist/Pantheist I believe God exist in all and is all, in the same tradition as Seneca and Lao tzu as I understand these two philosophical giants. Currently, I am not a member of any religious organization nor to I profess any religious denomination. I don\'t know if I would consider myself a Stoic simply because there is so much more to learn and this is what brought me to register for this course. I have a thirst to learn as much as I can about stoicism  but more importantly, I want to learn how to apply stoicism in my daily life. I do not have a strong background in philosophy but I am interested in learning the history, theories and application of the stoic masters and sages. From this course I am hoping to attain a level of competent understanding of stoicism and in so doing,  be able to share what I have learned with my family. \r\n\r\n     Furthermore, my goal is to continue through to the graduate course, gain a deeper understanding of stoicism and how it can be applied today, with the intention to   possibly teach stoicism to my friends and community, or even as an facilitator with the College of stoic Philosophy.  Stoicism is new to me and while I have not gone into a deep study of this philosophy, what I have been able to surmise is that this is a method/path that can help many people find their true self and transform their passions, I would like to be one who will benefit from this teaching and also one whom will be able to help others benefit and acheive joy and happiness through stoicism.', 1, '', 1, 0, 0, '', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 'I was born and raised in the great Pacific Northwest and continue to live, work and play in the greater Seattle area.

I am Scott Hopkins,39 years old and currently living in Kalamazoo, Michigan.  Because my mother divorced my father when I was 7 and moved across the state to Kalamazoo, I had little influence from my father and did not see him from age 9 to 17, when I reestablished contact.  I mention this first, because I believe it to have been a foundational circumstance in my life.  I have been a voracious reader as long as I can remember, first fiction, but now mostly non-fiction (philosophy, psychology, history) and classic literature.  From 1990 through 1996 I was enlisted in the United States Marine Corps in infantry and reconnaissance.  I married early, had four children, became divorced after 13 years, and am currently remarried.  In 2011, I finished my BS in Psychology and Counseling at Liberty University in Virginia. \r\n  \r\nMy first introduction to Stoicism was in high school, when I read a book that had a Stoic Roman Centurion as the protagonist.  I recall being impressed by his nobility and bearing though I do not think I could have articulated it like that at the time.  In my late 20\'s I came across The Golden Sayings of Epictetus in my set of the Harvard Classics.  This condensation of his discourses resonated with me, but I had no idea who he was or that he was a Stoic.  Over the years I went on to read Aurelius and Seneca.  Seneca\'s On the Shortness of Life is one of my favorites.  I have also read Plato\'s Apology, Crito, Phaedo, Republic; Xenophon\'s Memorabilia;  Aristotle\'s Ethics; Seneca\'s Letters from a Stoic; Plutarch, and Boethius.  I am currently working my way through the Discourses of Epictetus.  Coincidently, I recently finished Tom Wolfe\'s A Man in Full which I came across as I was reading the Discourses.  It was Providential in that it allowed me to put some flesh on the Discourses in a contemporary setting.\r\n\r\nI was raised as a Baptist, nominally in my youth and then more seriously as an adult.  At one point I had the intention of becoming a pastor and so studied theology quite a bit, particularly Reformed theology.  I struggled after my divorce in 2005 (which I did not initiate), first about the divorce and then the separation from my children and the financial strain that comes from child support.  The first year on my own I discovered Aurelius\' Meditations.  The lesson he tried to impart to me was to not allow external circumstances to affect my internal tranquility.  I hung on to that lesson, but it is one that is eminently difficult to anchor in the mind without a couple of other components:  that tranquility comes from a life that is in accord with virtue, and by understanding what is and is not in my control.  During this time, my worldview was Christian, but I had stopped going to church and my lifestyle was decidedly un-Christian and immoral.  After I met my current wife, I began attending church again, took up theology, particularly Augustine, Calvin, and the Puritans, and commenced to finishing my degree.  \r\n\r\nAbout a year and a half ago, I began to question the doctrine of revelation, the justice of eternal punishment, and Christian morality.  Christians say that our reason is fouled and so God revealed Himself in the Bible; we are to accept revelation as foundational.  What shook me was that Calvin used reason to argue in support of revelation.  (Off topic, but the first book written by John Calvin was a commentary on Seneca.)  This seemed to undermine revelation.  The second issue is that it seems quite unjust to punish eternally a being for simply not believing in someone whom he never had the opportunity to hear of.  How many millions lived before Jesus Christ and in the years before Christianity became a world religion?  On the other hand, all men can reason that God exists and that virtue is the way to happiness.  In fact, noted Christian apologist C.S. Lewis, in the last book of his Narnia series has one of his characters welcomed into "heaven" for living a virtuous life even though he worshiped another god.  And finally, I do not see contemporary Christians as more happy or moral than anyone else in society.  There seems to be a disconnect.  Does God make me good or do I do it?  Both are presented.  Two things made me question the idea of Christian righteousness.  First was that my instructor in a contemporary religions course stated that Buddhists tend to live more moral lives than Christians.  Second, as I was reading the Puritan John Owen on how to live a moral life, his prescription sounded very much like what I had read of Socrates (and now as I understand Epictetus), examine your life, identify vice, replace it with virtue.  All of this is to say, I no longer consider myself a Christian.  For a bit I considered reviving the worship of Thor as it seemed like it would be a very manly religion.  This was before I discovered that there are Stoics among us.  \r\n\r\nI do believe that God exists.  I cannot know this, but using my reason I have examined the evidence of existence and come to the conclusion that it is more likely God exists than not, though in the Plotinian sense as the foundation of all being â€¦ Being Itself.  \r\n\r\nI have made forays into both Neo-Platonism through Hadot\'s work on Plotinus and Existentialism through Nietchze, Kierkegaard, Tillich, and the psychologist Rollo May.  \r\n\r\nCurrently, I do not consider myself a Stoic, but I do want to learn more and come to a greater understanding.  I have already begun to try to examine myself to see what I value, whether it is in my power or not, and to treat those things that are not with indifference.  This is hard work.  Through this course I hope to gain a greater understanding of Stoicism, particularly how to live in modern society as a man.  I also hope to meet men who desire to live in conformity with their nature as men, something that is sorely lacking in our confused world.', 1, '', 0, 0, 0, '', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', 1, 0, '', '');

I spent the entirety of my pre-adult years, excluding a brief stint in Ohio, living in this Pensacola or its surrounding towns.  As an adult I immediately joined the Navy in a position that supported non-combat missions.  The Navy sent me to the Florida Panhandle for a year, to Iceland for 18 months and to Scotland for 30 months.  I spent the next year living off my savings, with my parent\'s help, while working on a degree.  This ended with the beginning of the "Dark Time" described below.\r\n           As a young lad I was kidnapped and, umm, bad things happened as part of that kidnapping.  In adulthood I went through a "Dark Time" during which I dropped out of school, was disowned by my Dad, my Mom committed suicide and my first wife left me.  This "Dark Time" showed me the downside of relying upon others and have impressed upon me the need to find happiness within.  I also began to refuse to take responsibility for the happiness of others and often state, "It is not my job to make you happy.  That is your job."  I understand a certain type of hardship.\r\n    After the "Dark Time" I moved to Washington State and began life again.  I worked for telecommunications companies, drank too much alcohol and was generally socially isolated.  I met my 2nd wife who brought along a son and daughter to the marriage and then brought along another son and daughter after the marriage.  Since the end of the "Dark Time" I have worked for a variety of internet companies as a network engineer and am currently supporting the US Army Corps of Engineers\' network.  I went back to school and got my A.S. degree.  I later went back to school a second time and earned my B.S. degree.\r\n    I am a father, a husband, a son, a brother and a friend.  My relationship with and the development of my children is my greatest concern. I have a 21 year old daughter who is as healthy as they come, I have a 7 year old son who sees the doctor monthly to ensure his health is on track and I two more children between these poles.  I have a wife who twice separated her pelvis in pregnancy and has long term pain issues; she also struggles with depression and has accepted her need to be medicated for the remainder of her life.  I have a sister who has struggles of her own.  I have a father with whom I struggle to maintain a civil relationship.  I have friends who are amazing people who struggle mightily in their own passions and lives.\r\n    I am a deist.  I was raised as a Christian in the Southern Baptist tradition.  My mother was, as best I can tell, a closet Buddhist and this exerted a strong influence over me.  I struggled to maintain a relationship with a Church.  I prayed for release from the Church, for the strength to find my own way and I believe I have this release and hope I have this strength.  I have not been to a Church, except to attend civil ceremonies, for 15 years.  Given the sanctification of Francis of Assissi I think there is sufficient overlap to be both a theist and a pantheist.  For better or worse, I pursue a syncretic religion of Stoic and Christian traditions.\r\n    I am a Stoic.  I came across stoicism in an accidental manner.  My wife was watching an episode of Law and Order in which the bad guy had created a small cult following based on The Meditations of Marcus Aurelius.  I was intrigued, bought a copy of the book and found that what I  read fit with what I believed.  I followed that reading with Seneca\'s Letters from a Stoic, the Enchiridion of Epictetus and various essays by James Stockdale.  After many years of using only those few books I have expanded my reading to include A Guide to the Good Life: The Ancient Art of Stoic Joy.  In public discussions on religion I stick to the pat line, "I have faith."\r\n    I have studied.  In high school I read and valued the Tao te Ching.  In the military I read and re-read many times The Art of War and Zen Flesh Zen Bones.  In my first few post-church years I read a great deal of Therevadan Buddhism including A Constitution for Living.  I would likely have continued on the Therevadan path had I not happened across The Meditations.  I have a Bachelors in Science from Eastern Oregon University in Philosophy, Political Science and Economics (PPE).  My relevant classwork includes Comparative Religions, The Philosophy of Yoga, various Ethics and Western Philosophy courses -- although nothing older than Descartes.\r\n    I find it difficult to be a Stoic in the modern world.  There are no meeting places, there are no weekly televised instructions, there are few guides to light the way.  I would like to deepen my understanding of Stoicism.  It is my belief that this increased understanding will improve my daily life, but I also realize the risk that increased understanding may make me realize that Stoicism is not a good match for me and am willing to accept either outcome.  I am hopeful that this course will teach me Stoic practices that I can apply to everyday life.\r\n    I have attempted to embrace two Stoic practices.  I attempt to reflect nightly on the course of the day\'s events and of my actions for the day.  I also attempt to daily reflect on the impermanence of things by choosing one valued thing that I might lose and trying to understand how I might deal with the loss.  I find both of these practices immensely valuable, but I find that when life gets busy I sometimes let these practices slide.  I am hopeful that the effort exposed in completing the SES will increase not only the variety but also the consistency of my practice.', 1, '', 0, 0, 0, '', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', 1, 0, '', ''),

Because of that, and because I was the only boy on my father\'s side of the family, I led a relatively protected childhood. I was treated significantly better than my sister by the family, something that still presents a barrier in our relationship. I was an active, happy child. My greatest joys involved the outdoors, especially hunting and fishing with my father. \r\n\r\n	When I was four years old, I was hit by a car on my street as a result of my own negligence. I ran out into the street without looking. The driver didn\'t see me until after I darted out between cars parked along the narrow residential street. The driver carried my apparently lifeless body to the door of my home in search of a place to telephone an emergency squad. The ambulance crew rushed me to the hospital. I needed extensive therapy and rehabilitation, but I was able to make a full recovery. \r\n\r\n	My late childhood to adolescence were marked by my struggle to figure out what to do with my life when my relationship with my father destabilized and I realized he was fallible. He drifted in and out of my life throughout this period, and that contributed to my lack of a strong foundation. Because I lacked a foundation, I had trouble establishing an identity and had difficulties resisting peer pressure. That continued until near the end of high school, when I believed I had gotten one of my classmates pregnant and realized I needed to grow up. \r\n\r\n	It turned out the child was not mine. I found out too late to start college with my classmates and instead continued to work full time while attending college part time. I dabbled in different areas for a while before settling into the study of history, with an emphasis on classical and medieval Europe. I met my wife during college, and she encouraged me to make a career plan and pursue a single goal, instead of studying whatever seemed interesting in the moment. As a result, I followed her to law school, where I studied part time and continued to work. I finally graduated at the head of my class, passed the bar exam, and landed a position as Staff Attorney to a trial court judge.\r\n \r\n	Currently, I am a lawyer practicing as the right hand of a judge who presides over civil cases valued over $15,000 and over felony cases and appeals from administrative agency rulings. I also provide research and writing support to my wife, who is a solo practitioner focusing on bankruptcy law. I have a 3-year-old daughter who is the light of my life. I enjoy running, baking bread, reading, playing tabletop role-playing games, and fishing.  \r\n\r\n	I have been interested in Stoicism since I encountered Seneca, Cicero, and Marcus Aurelius during high school Latin class. I did not follow that interest diligently at that time. Instead, I passed between different religions, seeking answers to my philosophical and spiritual questions on those paths. I experimented with neopaganism, Buddhism, and the Bahai faith before discovering that none of those paths really fit my needs. I also read the texts of other religions. The common thread in all of my religious seeking was that I firmly believed in a supreme being of some sort that had created the universe and set the rules by which it operates. \r\n\r\n	Finding myself with free time to pursue my own interests at the end of law school, I began to follow up on my attraction to Stoicism. My first real exposure came from Marcus Aurelius\' Meditations and a collection of Seneca\'s letters. Since then, I have read J.H. Sanbach\'s The Stoics, The Stoic Philosophy (a lecture by Gilbert Murray), The Enchiridon, and some shorter essays on Stoicism. I also follow Michel Daw\'s blog, Living the Stoic Life. To aid in my studies, I have created StoicLawyer, a Wordpress blog (although I have not updated it in about four weeks). \r\n\r\n	I have studied philosophy in general, but I wouldn\'t say that I have devoted myself to any one philosophy other than Stoicism. I had a philosophy major for about 2 years in college, taking courses in logic, religious philosophy, political philosophy, and ethics. I also studied philosophy to a degree in law school, especially utilitarianism and the other philosophies which have been influential on the development of American law. I have also read books and articles that dealt with Chinese and Japanese philosophy. My senior thesis in history dealt with the influence of the Arab/Muslim inheritors of the Classical Greek tradition on the Florentine philosopher Giovanni Pico Della Mirandola. \r\n\r\n	I consider myself a Stoic. I am endeavoring to learn more about Stoicism so that I can learn to integrate its ideas more fully into my life and consciousness. In doing this, I am aware that I may not remain a Stoic for the rest of my life. But in large part, I am inspired by an article I read during a philosophy of religion class. That article argued that one can enhance belief by actively practicing the forms of a religion. The author lived in a convent for about a year and deepened her Catholic faith. My hope is that by living and studying as a Stoic, I can begin to deepen my commitment to the Stoic focus on discriminating between the Good and the indifferent and on maintaining a life according to nature and the dictates of reason.  \r\n\r\n	I believe the Stoic Essential Studies Course would provide me a directed plan in studying Stoicism and living a Stoic life. Because I have so many pressing professional and familial obligations, I fear that I will not manage to be disciplined in studying Stoicism without the outline provided by a guide and mentor. I do not want to be distracted away from Stoicism and I think that enrolling in the Stoic Essential Studies Course will provide me with a study guide and some much-needed accountability.', 1, '', 0, 0, 0, '', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', 1, 0, '', ''),

I was born in a middle class Spanish family, in a small town in the north of Spain. My father was a painter, who was going through a very good moment of his career. My mother didn\'t need to work then and she spent a lot of time with me and my only sister, two years younger than me. My parents, with very different personalities, got on very well, so the atmosphere at home was very nice. From those years, I remember fondly many short excursions with them to nearby woods and a beautiful rocky beach, where my father taught me the basics about diving, hobby that accompanied me since then.\r\nMy father\'s professional compromises took us to Madrid for one year. After that, we went back to my hometown and we established in a new large flat, where I quickly made new acquaintances, some of which are still among my best friends. A few years later, things at home began to go worse. My father become cantankerous and bad tempered, which affected his work, and also our income.  Shortly after, he was diagnosed with a severe cancer that made him go through very painful years that finally carried him to dead.\r\nAlthough the sadness and grief that followed his death, I remember the following years as a happy ones. My mother, having to take care of my sister and I, returned to her old job and bravely earned the living for the three of us. I was sixteen by then and after having gone out such a sad period, I was really willing to have fun.  Thanks to my mother\'s encouragement, I studied enough (and just enough) to finish high school and go to University. Partly driven by a clear lack of any particular vocation, and partly because I didn\'t want to increase my mother\'s bills, I decided to study Law, studies that I could follow without leaving my town.\r\nDuring my first years at the University, I seriously committed myself to enjoy as much as possible. This commitment supposed to attend the maximum amount of parties and meet as many girls as I was able to. Looking back to that period now, I guess that I was an Epicurean then, although I didn\'t have any idea of what it did mean! By the last two years in the University I started to develop a strong necessity for going out and seeing the world.  I travelled with a reduced budget across Spain and Europe, experiences that made me realize that I wanted to move on and live out of my small hometown. I sped up with my studies and finally got my degree in Law, running away to England without any particular plans.\r\nOnce in London, I hired a room, took a job as a waiter and started to study English. I spent one year there. I met a lot of interesting people, but I past also plenty of hours on my own. This was an eye-opening experience. Afterwards, I had to come back to Spain to attend my military service, graduating as a Second Lieutenant.\r\nAnd thus it came time to decide what to do with my live. I have always admired men with a clear vocation, but unfortunately this has never been my case. I have always known that this is a clear disadvantage in life and years later, when I read the famous Seneca\'s sentence "If one does not know to which port one is sailing, no wind is favorable", I could not but admired its truthfulness. Luckily, there were a few things I was sure of: I wasn\'t interested in working as a lawyer, judge or others jobs directly connected with Law. At the same time, I was resolved to get a safe working. I have never been particularly interested about money beyond what is necessary for living, or said in other words, I was determined to solve the money problem once and for all. And this is how I arrived to my present post, a job as a middle-rank technician in the Spanish administration.\r\nAfter a period in the Administration School, I was sent to Barcelona. Initially, my plans were to spend a few years here and move on to another place, but after a few months in the new city, my live got completely changed when I met the woman who short later became my wife. Fifteen years have passed since our marriage and I must admit that there hasn\'t been any single day during which I have repented. Definitely, she was a great choice! When I am with her I have never felt bored. Furthermore, she is the person who better knows me, even better than myself! We donÂ´t have children and we donÂ´t miss them, so we try to travel abroad always we have some spare time.\r\nAs far as my hobbies are concerned, ten years ago I started to play sports regularly. Curiously this didnÂ´t happen until I was thirty five, when I discovered that sports is not a matter of competing with others but with oneself. Now I am reasonable fit and I follow my own training regimen that combines running, indoor cycling, swimming and a little of weight lifting. I am also fond of hiking and sea kayaking.\r\nWhen I look back in time and wonder if I have had a happy life, the answer is "In a large extent, yes" , though  there have obviously been some  "dark moments". One of those "dark moments" was about four years ago, when I went through a time when my job was really boring my. This situation was making me feel really sad and I wondered if I wasnÂ´t wasting my life in a useless job. Of course I didnÂ´t consider I was guilty, but instead I blamed the external circumstances, the bad luck and other people. During that period, I read some books about self-help, positive thinking and Buddhism. I am sure that those books didn\'t contain any original material, but because I didn\'t have any backgrounds in philosophy, psychology, nor spirituality, I consider that they made my good. Mainly, I realized that happiness is not necessarily a matter of external circumstances, but a matter that in a big extent, depends on you.  That discovery supposed to me a big challenge: To take responsibility for my own happiness, without being a slave of external circumstances.\r\nAfterwards, I continued reading more books, some of them better than others, and then I came across the Marco Aurelio\'s "Meditations". His conception of the Universe as a unique living creature conquered me. I immediately felt much more comfortable with a point of view that assimilates the Universe with the Divinity, rather than with the God of the Bible I was talked about at school, that created the Universe in six days. After that, I read Seneca\'s "Letters from a Stoic" and also I got deeply impressed. Both books discovered me the importance of the acceptance of the Destiny, as the only way available to reach happiness and at the same time, reconciling this idea with the responsibility for my own character. \r\nSince then, I have read some more books about Philosophy, one of them a good History of Ancient Greek Philosophy, but none made me such an impression as the Stoics did. A few days ago I found the "New Stoa" website and immediately I dove into it. I really enjoyed the visit. After having checked it deeply, and having reading the excellent Wiegardt\'s "Stoic Handbook", I felt determined to take the challenge of going deeper on the knowledge of Stoic Philosophy and try to make a daily practice of it.', 1, '', 1, 0, 0, '', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', 0, 1, '', 'Don\'t have exact date, but probably in 2014'),

By the time this is processed I will be finished with school, and have some considerable time off before starting again. I have updated my essay since I last applied, but the changes are minor.', 'Over the past few years, as I have developed philosophically, I have been told a number of times by a number of well-educated associates that some aspects of my view of life are much like those of the Stoics. "That sounds just like Stoicism," said my friend Stephen, after discussing with him my understanding of virtue. I have long been interested in virtue ethics; from my first philosophy class (a course in introductory ethics), I found it much more satisfying than merely consequentialist systems like utilitarianism. Around the same time, I had been reading a science fiction novel where Odysseus was wandering around on the surface of a futuristic Earth, teaching a modern eloi how to survive in a dangerous world after their comforts crumble, and about a more satisfying thing to live for than pleasure: arete. Though I had not yet seen a direct connection, both ideas struck a chord.\r\n\r\nAgain, around the same time, I had gone through a drawn-out crisis of faith. I was raised by a Pentecostal single mother, but others in my family were more open to a scientific worldview, which allowed me to develop doubt regarding (indeed, rejection of) a literal account of events in the Bible. For a long time, I was a moderate non-denominational theist. During my first semester in college, I began studying philosophy, and I could no longer deny the sheer unreason of the narrow conception of God that religion presents. I quickly proceeded from pantheist to atheist, as I am unconvinced that there is really that much of a difference between the two views outside semantics. To clarify, I consider myself an atheist with regards to belief, but epistemologically speaking I am an agnostic and a skeptic.\r\nWhen it was finally revealed to me by Stephen that the Stoics were philosophers of virtue, who also held the unique position of formulating their views in a manner consistent with modern science (and an atheist universe), that is when I became interested. This was in mid-2010, so I can say that I have been interested in Stoicism for about two years.\r\n\r\nAfter some investigation, ethically speaking, I indeed appear to be something of a Stoic. However, I do have some difficulty in "remembering" to live in accord with nature, which means, to me, that I have not yet made virtue habitual.\r\n\r\nIn addition to Stoicism, I have studied a number of branches of philosophy with varying degrees of depth. I started on my road to studying philosophy with Marxism, which was my early response to the unfairness that permeates modern society. I also developed an interest in Nietzsche, intrigued by Thus Spake Zarathustra. When I started community college, I grew a broader understanding of philosophy and realized that what I had previously pursued was sophistry. With time, I became more interested in epistemology and the philosophy of science, given my scientific interests. Currently, I am planning to pursue a minor in the history and philosophy of science when I transfer to a university. Part of the reason I am interested in these two branches is because I want to be sure that what I am investigating in my future career as a scientist not only has significance in the human sphere, but also is true or approximately true. I was thrust back into social philosophy during the Occupy movement, which I became quite active in within a few weeks of starting to consider myself a deontological libertarian. As the movement progressed, despite us sharing common disapproval of the injustice of our current society, my libertarian views came under attack by the majority of those involved, mainly liberal of some persuasion or other. It became clear to me that libertarianism, while rejecting violence and coercion, did little to actively promote individual well-being. However, the prospect of holding a social belief on a deontological basis has its appeal (making it no longer such a matter of faith but of reason to "believe" in some political or social position), and so, looking around for such an outlet, I stumbled upon New Stoa. So far as I can tell, Stoicism is more compatible with communitarian beliefs (which make sense even on a purely historical basis, coming from a civilization organized into city-states). That is convenient, too, since I was already looking into communitarian writers to better understand it.\r\n\r\nSince I feel that my philosophical opinions are at least fairly consistent with my hopes for the future of humankind as well as for myself, I cannot help but mention one "bridge" that I have discovered (of perhaps several) that provides a goal that I see for improving the condition. This bridge is Turner\'s Frontier thesis. The Frontier thesis is the claim that what made the early United States the bastion of freedom, individuality, creativity, ingenuity, and so forth was the perpetual challenge of the open frontier, and that the reason these essentially American traits have waned is due to the closing of the American Frontier in the late 19th century. While I had long been interested in space and settlement as a curiosity only, it was the discovery of this thesis that gave me a why for advocating space settlement. The why is simple: to bring about the kind of massive scale leap forward in human rights and dignity, and the freedom of social experimentation to try new modes of living, we must have a frontier, and the only frontier remaining is space, the High Frontier. This is not merely a temporary solution, a single step in solving humanity\'s lack of physical resources and social stagnation, but a part of an ongoing process, as the High Frontier is (for all intents and purposes) boundless and limitless in potential solutions. Now, I had a moral imperative in addition to scientific curiosity to back my interest in space.\r\n\r\nIt is worth noting that for such a massive scale human endeavor, the only way that it will actually benefit humanity is if an enlightened philosophy is present to guide behavior. Just as the Enlightenment humanism of 18th century Europe guided the Founding Fathers in their grasping after a just republic, so too will such an enlightened philosophy enable the future settlers of the new Frontier to create a just society. I feel a revival of schools of thought like Stoicism will be a great step in the right direction.\r\n\r\nSo far, I have read all of the books on New Stoa\'s website (with the exception of The Book of Doubt), including "The Path of the Sage," which strongly echoes a number of views of mine. I also read a few of Seneca\'s epistles, but decided I would be better off having an introduction to Stoicism first. I have also been told a bit about various Stoics during my philosophy classes, and the pre-Stoic Heraclitus was covered by my professor at considerable length. I have Seneca\'s Epistles on my shelf, along with Marcus Aurelius\' Medidations and Epictetus\' Discourses, and Sellars\' book on Stoicism which I have yet to pick up, all of which I hope to go on to read after my introductory reading has been completed.\r\n\r\nSince initially applying for the College, I have had a chance to do some more reading on the side. I am fairly comfortable speculating on how a Stoic might view certain situations that arise, and have found Stoic thought help me keep my cool (as well as cool some others down!) in some situations that have arisen since I first investigated it.\r\n\r\nFrom what I have read, I find that Stoicism the consistent, rational and all-encompassing philosophy that I was looking for. Through taking the course at the Stoic College, I want to gain a better understanding of how Stoic physics relate to modern science; how various logics (first-order logic, possible worlds, modality, etc., which are what I have been trained in to some small degree) can relate to Stoicism; what is the Stoic "epistemology of virtue" (a concept introduced to me through the quarterly Philosopher\'s Magazine); and finally, how I might better habituate (or at least approximate) virtue in my own life. Furthermore, I am interested in other types of practices that might overlap with Stoicism -- the meditation spoken of in the books found in the New Stoa library, but also with another interest of mine: historical European martial arts. In the next month or so I will be moving to Portland, Oregon, where I will be taking a year off from school to study Stoicism and some of these other things, (and for working, saving money, and getting residency).', 1, '', 0, 0, 0, '', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', 1, 0, '', ''),

For me, it is a personal way to view the world that seems to present a clear picture of how best to cope and thrive in an imperfect world. I have tried to live my life, or at least parts of it, as if I was going to die in 3-5 years. By focusing on death, I have found that I can really prioritize the choices I make in life. In that pursuit, I have taken a lot of risks. Rode a motorcycle to South America, traveled to 68 countries, started businesses, and generally lived very well. But not without a bit of worry and I like the way Stoicism teaches one to deal with risk. In my life I have taken many risks, financial and otherwise and I have wasted time worrying about them. I like many of the quotes by Marcus Aurelius, like "Never let the future disturb you. You will meet it, if you have to, with the same weapons of reason which today arm you against the present." This quote focuses life on the present, almost in a Buddhist sort of way. But I have and still do worry and waste my time on stupid people, something I would like to change. \r\n\r\nWhat I am looking for out of this class is an organized way for me to learn with some feedback in an environment that is about applied philosophy, not theoretical philosophy. I have started Seneca and Aurelius several times but have difficulty finishing or really getting meaning without deadlines and expectations. So, it\'s a little lame that I can\'t do this on my own but I have hoping that with these expectations I will rise the occasion. \r\n\r\n   In much of my life, I have lived from a North American perspective, a frugal life and I like the way Stoicism justifies this (smile.)  As I learn more about Stoicism, I find that the ideas tend to agree with how I strive to live my life and I hope that by studying them I will be able to be more of myself. Perhaps I have taken some elements of Stoicism without really understanding where they might have originally come from. I would like to learn where they come from and be able to clearly define how it affects me. Not only to justify how I live my life but to improve how I live it and how I treat the world around me. \r\n\r\nShort Life Story\r\nI was born in Corvallis, Oregon in 1971. My father was a psychology professor and my mother was a school teacher. I have a sister five years older than me and a brother 7 years older than me. I grew up on a small farm and went on to study chemical engineering at University of Washington while rowing on the crew team. I worked summers in Alaska to pay for school and was able to save enough money to travel after graduation. The first year I traveled every place my hero Indiana Jones traveled and many placed in between. The second year I traveled from China to Australia. Then I returned home and worked at Boeing while going to graduate school for business and engineering and living a wonderful city life while pursuing many interests. Then I sold most of my stuff and traveled another year to many fun places taking 14 one way unplanned international flights. The following year I left on a motorcycle trip intending to go around the world for three years but got bored in Brazil and moved back to Seattle. Upon starting a business, I wasn\'t able to make enough money so I moved to Tucson to take an evil corporate job in 2003 and have been here ever since. I managed to invest in real estate related things and continue to do so while working with the intent to stop working in a few years. I spent a few decades chasing girls and as I got older (I am 41 now) felt that it was better for me to start a family to have a more enriching life and I found the right girl few years ago and have been married a year. My wife is really great, super smart and supporting and since she has a PhD in Philosophy, is good to talk to. We are expecting a son in a few weeks and that should lead me into a new chapter of my life. Both of our parents and her brother live on the same street and we have regular dinners which include intellectual discussions of various topics. I like to learn new things and right now I am making an Aquaponics garden, beekeeping, and learning marksmanship. Life is good! \r\n\r\nI hope my mentor will challenge me and set expectations on what I should learn and apply. I have ordered the books and am ready to start a hot summer in Tucson, Arizona USA becoming a Stoic! \r\n\r\nAnswers to questions not covered above\r\nI have read a bit of Seneca and Marcus Aurelius but haven\'t really retained as much as I would like to. I want to, like the assignments listed say, be able to have the memories of the Stoics in my mind to help me tackle difficult issues. I believe there is an intentional creator, mostly because I cannot explain the creation of the universe any other way. But if there is a creator, I believe that much like a clockmaker; the creator has wound up the clock and does not interact with our world anymore. But I realize that I might not be able to comprehend much of these fine points with my simple mind. I am really not a member of a religious faith nor have I studied formal philosophy. I would consider myself wanting to learn more about Stoicism and that would most likely be the closest form of a religion or personal philosophy that I have. I would like to be challenged by this class and have some expectations for me to perform as a student.', 1, '', 0, 0, 0, '', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', 1, 0, '', ''),

When I was five years of age my parents divorced, which had an understandable impact on my life, setting up what I would call a dichotomy of the mind. Each parent, and their respective clan, represented a completely different world-view, a completely different way of life, from each other. One was old-school Eastern-European Northern American blue collar, the other was Northern-European Southern American aristocrat. I found each fulfilling, and each lacking, in their own way, but there was never a synthesis for me. \r\n\r\nMy father introduced me to philosophy and we had many such discussions, ranging from "The Dancing Wu Li Masters" when I was in the 6th grade to Rush\'s 2112 and Ayn Rand when I was in High School. He was raised on the streets of Chicago, so naturally he was partial to William James and Pragmatism. Yet I believe his Catholicism prevented him from embracing Ayn Rand\'s philosophy, whose followers he characterized as Star-Trek Spock wannabes.   \r\n\r\nMy mother was not philosophical, per se, but raised in a strict Southern Norwegian household. She would, I believe, fulfill the ideas of Stoicism in the way that she lived -- dutiful, disciplined, practical, unable to suffer fools gladly. \r\n \r\nI joined the United States Marine Corps after failing college and failing life. I was 19 years old and washing dishes, virtually homeless. I joined for the discipline. I spent five years enlisted, rising to the rank of Corporal, as an avionics technician. I spent time in Japan and was stationed in Beaufort, South Carolina, home of Lt. Col. "Bull" Meechum, of "The Great Santini" fame. The Marine Corps did not really get inside me, as I was a skeptic my entire time in. I hated it, as we all did, but I rejected most of what was new to me, using old standards from my youth. I was so afraid of them changing me, I did not allow myself to change. One of my friends in the Marines gave me a copy of Will Durant\'s "Story of Philosophy." I only mention this because philosophy and the search for meaning has been part of my life since I was born, and I suppose it is obvious to those around me.\r\n\r\nMy first taste of formal philosophical instruction came in college at the University of Kansas, my freshman year. I enrolled in Philosophy 101, which was taught by a young grad student. Our first assignment was to read short selections from Kant and Plato and Nietzsche, among others, and discuss what they were talking about. It was purely an intellectual exercise, and I found it meaningless. I even cornered the instructor and asked him why were learning this if it would have no impact on our daily life, and he seemed both perplexed and irritated at the question. I was fresh out of the Marine Corps, and hungry for real life, not one that is dictated, supervised, and structured. I wanted to act, not to dream. I was done with the dreaming of life, and ready for the living of it; this class was just formalized dreaming. I dropped it immediately. \r\n\r\nI have only been interested in Stoicism itself for just a few weeks. I seek a more formalized and active approach to Western philosophy, after a lifetime of dabbling and reading, which is why I am applying. I became aware of the power and influence of Stoicism from reading an antique book I picked up called "From Epicurus to Christ, A Study in the Principles of Personality," in which the author outlines five reigning philosophies of the Western world, and how they may influence one\'s character (which he terms "personality"): Epicureanism, Stoicism, Platonism, Aristotilianism, and Christianity. I do not consider myself to be a Stoic, which is partly why I am here: I wish to learn what Stoicism is, what it means, and to adopt the praxis of Stoicism so that I can form a valid opinion on its merits. More specifically, I wish to use it to harness my emotions. \r\n\r\nI have never read a book on Stoicism alone, although I have read books that describe it, specifically: \r\n\r\nâ€¢	Weber, Alfred. "History of Philosophy." Charles Scribner\'s Sons, 1896.\r\n\r\nâ€¢	De Witt Hyde, William. "From Epicurus to Christ, A Study in the Principles of Personality." The MacMillan Company, 1904. \r\n\r\nâ€¢	Smith, T.V.  "Philosophers Speak for Themselves, Guides and Readings for Greek, Roman, and Early Christian Philosophy." University of Chicago Press, 1934.\r\n\r\nI would not call myself an atheist, agnostic/skeptic, deist, nor a theist, but rather a Roman Catholic. I was born, baptized, and raised as such, although I did spend most of my twenties and thirties exploring other belief systems, Buddhism in particular, Chan Buddhism (the Chinese father of Zen Buddhism) resonating with me the most. However, I soon found these belief systems lacking, not only in their original substance due to the watered-down, New Age western versions, but I found them lacking in an understanding of human love and compassion. As communities, the Buddhists in America do not satisfy my preference for intellectual and spiritual rigor. Catholicism, when approached as an adult, did, and still does. Its inquiries go as deep as Western Civilization itself. \r\n\r\nI have never studied a specific Western philosophy in detail, unless you wish to include the Catechism of the Catholic Church. I have only read the summaries of philosophies and the excerpts of philosophers. I have studied, and practiced, both Chan/Zen Buddhism, and Taoism to some extent. I admire Buddhist ethics, and Chan\'s rigor. I appreciate Taoist cosmology. \r\n\r\nIn 2000, I donated my kidney to my mother which allowed her five more years of life. I did not hesitate in this decision, as I saw it as a duty. In 2002, I moved "back home" in order to be her caregiver. For three years I was her caregiver, living with her and supervising her medical care. She passed away in 2005. Although this experience had a devastating impact on my worldly success, I only blame my inability to navigate out of it, rather than the experience, or the decision, itself. \r\n\r\nIn closing, let me remind the reader that this is a purely autobiographical account, and as such, may be distorted and biased to such a degree that I resemble nothing close to what I describe.

After high school, my father urged me toward college because I was a pretty good learner, and he suggested that I not waste such a gift by enlisting in the military like he had. (I don\'t think he was implying that his 26 years of service were a waste, only that I should have the opportunity to earn more.) So, my sister and I became the first generation in our family to attend and graduate from university. My job thereafter took me to Texas, where I met my future wife, a Colorado native of Japanese ancestry. We relocated to her home state and have lived in Colorado for about 23 years now. I\'m currently 49 and work as a technical writer for VMware, a Silicon Valley computer software company. At Erik\'s request, I also happen to be the New Stoa Regional Director for Western USA. \r\n\r\nMy first intentional exposure to Stoicism came from reading the Dover thrift edition of Aurelius\' Meditations. That was about ten years ago. Not long after, my wife gave me Sharon Lebell\'s take on Epictetus, The Art of Living. I even subscribed to an online list called "Thus Spoke Epictetus" that automatically emailed you a Stoic saying every day, but the list author has since discontinued his creation. In those days, I couldn\'t remember a time when I wasn\'t buffeted by externals, so the idea that one could let go and reach some degree of tranquility was very appealing. I was also reading about cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for the first time, thinking that it might be another way to temper my reactions. \r\n\r\nMaybe I subconsciously knew that something big was coming, maybe it was the proverbial soul\'s cry, but whatever it was, those early days of enjoying the Stoic texts turned out to be too little, too late. At age 45 I had a heart attack and spent the next week on my back in the hospital. Among the risk factors for heart disease is how we respond to the inevitable stresses that surround us. (The other risk factors are smoking, weight, physical exercise, cholesterol, high blood pressure, and heredity.) Physicians tell their patients to manage heart disease by addressing the risk factors that they can influence; i.e., everything but heredity. In your toolbox are four options for bettering your situation: diet, medication, physical activity, and attitude. In addition, you can attack certain risk factors on multiple fronts, for example by lowering cholesterol through both diet and medication. So, considering stress, Stoic philosophy looked to me like a great attitude adjustment plan, one that would be a genuine life changer and be preferable to taking mind-altering medication and suffering the associated side effects. That all being said, I often feared that my response groove was very deep, and that reprogramming the brain might prove to be too difficult. In spite of that, I looked for more resources, stumbled upon New Stoa, and here we are. \r\n\r\nSo, back to the resources and books. I\'ve read the Hays and Long translations of the Meditations, Letters from a Stoic (Seneca), On the Shortness of Life (Seneca), In Consolation to his Wife (Plutarch), The Art of Living (Lebell), Don\'t Worry, Be Stoic (Vernezze), and The Good Life (Irvine). I\'ve also read Erik\'s original Handbook in PDF and have at least scanned many of the other resources that he\'s been kind enough to write for us. And I have a stack of formal Stoic books waiting to be read, including The Inner Citadel by Hadot and Stoic Serenity by Keith Seddon. \r\n\r\nTheologically, my leanings are deist, mostly because I suspect that time wouldn\'t mean the same thing to God as it does to us. Put another way, we humans might choose to interpret events as having a god who\'s dynamically responding to our prayers, but it seems far more likely that the universe exists in a fashion that\'ll cause it to unfold a certain way, and that it\'s our difficult job to understand and accept that, and to want for nothing more than what already is. But I\'m only guessing. I certainly don\'t have inside knowledge about the true nature of deity.\r\n\r\nIn terms of formally recognizing God, I\'ve visited the Unitarian church a couple times in the last several years, but that\'s about it. When I was young, I used to identify solely with Christianity, probably due to growing up around that religion and attending churches of assorted denominations pretty regularly. But Christianity is changing into something that I almost don\'t recognize anymore, at least in today\'s USA. I still believe that Jesus\' ethics were right and true, and I believe he was the "Son" of God in a meaningful albeit perhaps only symbolic sense. But I seldom think about Christ in the observably supernatural way that the fundamentalists and evangelicals do. \r\n\r\nI haven\'t formally studied religion or philosophy though, having been an engineering and language major in school. I took one summer session of Philosophy 101 as an elective but remember almost nothing about it 30 years later, though I recall that the Stoics were mentioned. Do I consider myself to be a Stoic? I\'m not very materialistic about possessions or personal status, so that might count in my favor. But some days I think I must be the least qualified Stoic in New Stoa. Once in a while, somebody will tell me that I seem to be pretty calm and laid back, but nobody can see that my thoughts are often roiling inside. And I do have a hedonistic streak that enjoys having a great time with friends whenever possible. Does that sound like a good Stoic to you? \r\n\r\nSo do I consider myself a Stoic? Well, if I\'m not a Stoic I want to be and maybe even need to be when you consider the health issue. And if I *am* a Stoic, I\'d like to be better at it. With that in mind, I\'ve been meaning to take the essential studies for at least a year or more now. I hope that our focus is on applied Stoicism in the here and now though, and not just a course in Classics.\r\n\r\nB.N.', 1, '', 0, 0, 0, '', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', 1, 0, '', '');

My father is a Vietnam veteran and served with the United States Marine Corps. My mother is a very devout woman of faith who has worked in public education for the majority of her life and has recently retired. I have a younger sister, a niece, and a nephew. I have been married for 4 years to a wonderful woman and we are currently without children at this time. \r\n\r\n	I currently have two official occupations: Special Education Assistant for visually impaired students for the Los Angeles Unified School District and Lead Instructor for a women\'s self defense program/private business known as Basic Instinct. When I am not working I also train and teach with Muzosa Bujinkan Dojo, a traditional martial arts school here in the L.A. area. I also am very involved with a Hellenic polytheist worship/study group here in Los Angeles as well. \r\n\r\n	The most influential events in my life would have to include the time I spent with my father growing up listening to his war stories, the numerous religious debates I had with my mother, my martial training, as well as my exploration of polytheist tradition and religion which in turn led me to travel to Greece, an event which was very pivotal in opening the door for me to explore Hellenic philosophy as well as become politically aware. . \r\n\r\n	The time I spent with my father was very formative for me as I learned many things about life and death as well as character. He is probably the single, most influential person in my life in terms of character aside from my long time friend and martial arts instructor. My father does not do much talking, but his actions were always what spoke for him and revealed his character. I find myself emulating him more and more as I get older and I could not be prouder to do so. \r\n\r\n	My mother was also an influence on me, but in an indirect manner. She is a very devout religious woman who did her best to raise her children with a high sense of morality based on the Judeo-Christian tradition. I myself was never comfortable with the Church itself and so we often got into major debates about morality, religion, and ethics. While I rejected the Judeo-Christian tradition early on in my life, I still, and even more today, appreciated her sense of compassion and justice that she instilled in me. \r\n\r\n	Martial arts has also been a very big part of my life as I have been training in some capacity since I was a young child and have formally been training for over a decade now. The virtues I learned from training have helped shape my approach to just about everything in life. Learning about violence and war has helped me understand the value of peace even more so. Mt teachers have all been very influential people in my life and have helped me grow physically as well as psychologically. \r\n\r\n	I have been a polytheist for about ten years now and specifically a Hellenic polytheist for about four years when I was essentially adopted into the tradition during a trip to Greece in 2008. That experience in particular opened up my eyes to the world in ways that I could not have imagined. My understanding of pre-Christian Western religion and thought were piqued and I began heavily involved in Hellenic polytheism, learning about Greek mythology, culture, and history.  I also became very politically conscious and active since that trip and having experienced the level of civic participation that occurs in Greece. This was also about the time when I began exploring classical Hellenic philosophy to which I continue today. In this regard, I strongly believe that we are political animals as Aristotle said and that as Plato also inferred, it is important to be involved in the civic matters of one\'s city-state. Concepts like justice and civic good are very relevant in my opinion and are things that I think can assist us all as individuals and as a nation. \r\n\r\n	\r\n	My interest in Stoicism has been active for at least a couple of years now. I am currently reading Marcus Aurelius\' Meditations and have read a little bit from Epictetus. I feel that Stoicism, among the various Hellenic schools of thought, offers some of the best approaches towards one\'s own life as well as how one should live in society. It\'s cosmology is also very interesting to me and I would like to be able to delve into this philosophy in more formal manner. I do not at the moment consider myself a formal Stoic, although I would say that my martial training as well as the virtues that my father raised me with are right in line with Stoic thought. \r\n\r\n	What I seek from a more focused and formalizes study in Stoicism is an opportunity to focus more on the philosophy and hopefully develop a more personal and deeper understanding of what Stoic thought offers. I believe that this can best be accomplished through mentorship as well as formalized contemplation. It is my hope that with formalized study, I can develop a more stable set of personal values and practices that I can carry with me throughout my life and perhaps pass down to my future children. Also, as a politically active individual who believes in Justice and civic virtue, I believe Stoicism can help me develop a stronger personal foundation from which to stand on when engaged in civic discourse, in particular. Everyday I am becoming more and more familiar with the various philosophies that are at the heart of modern western thought, but I keep finding Stoicism to be the most accessible to an American like myself and whose premises I find that I naturally gravitate towards. I have had discussions with my wife about this as well and she herself finds the philosophy of Stoicism to be very natural as well and so, I would like to formally engage in the study in order to help build myself, my family, and perhaps my community as well.', 1, '', 0, 0, 0, '', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', 1, 0, '', ''),

I saw a book in a store, and it caught my eye. The book is in Finnish and translates Stoicism - Philosophy of knowledge, emotions and the good  life. If one could point out that one book of all the books in the world that changed the course of a life, that is the book for me.\r\n\r\nIs it even possible to know oneself, or is it just within capacity to take one as is, and through that way understand one\'s nature? I\'d say that perhaps there is a moment when one learns to know oneself, and then it is time to die. Person must then become a sage, and there is no more reason to continue living because there would be no secret left.\r\n\r\nOne of my lifelong dreams since I was a teenager has been to write a book someday. Now, forty years later, it is becoming a reality. Way back then as a young whippersnapper I figured first one must learn to live to become an author. Now it feels like in graduation day!\r\n\r\nI spent a long time searching for happiness from external sources, just like most people, when the answers are, in fact, within us. Stoicism has helped me to change my attention in the right direction. All meaningful change comes from within us. I have to take the world as it is and let it be. Nevertheless, I can determine the 10 square feet I hold the way I want it.\r\n\r\nI hesitate to box myself under any banner. I\'d rather call myself constantly curious about life, and my goal is always to keep an open mind. I think all people should question everything and never take no for an answer. I truly believe that people set the limits for themselves. One must step out of the frame in order to determine the whole picture.\r\n\r\nNever take anything for granted, especially one\'s position in life. I have learned that the hard way, twice. Now I think that Stoicism has helped me to realize that I am the owner of my own destiny. No matter what happens, I choose how I react to it. Money, reputation, or possessions may be amenable, but they are not parts of my identity.\r\n\r\nAmong other things, I have been a soldier in two armies, a businessman, and a IT systems management consultant for large corporations, but my two terrific sons confirm my greatest success. I love them more than anything else in this world. My greatest desire is to earn my role as their father.\r\n\r\nIf asked about the hardest thing I have ever done, I\'d reply 58 days in Ranger School. I did not become a man that I am because I was a Ranger; I became a Ranger because a man that I am.\r\n\r\nMy upbringing was a Lutheran, but I rejected religion when I was a teenager because I had too many questions that the priests could not answer. I consider myself first and foremost a citizen of the world. Where I lay down my rucksack, I call home. I have not gone astray, although I wander. However, being free brings along a sense of isolation sometimes.\r\n\r\nIt fascinates me that modern scholars and scientists, for example, Viktor Frankl, have shown many Stoic tenets to be true. I also like Pascal Boyer\'s notion that religion is a parasite sprout from cognitive modules, comparable to the way the reading process is dependent upon language modules.\r\n\r\nEach person should take time to be alone. I consider cemeteries to be the best places for meditation. People there do not talk to me, but they make me think. If I visit a new country, I want to visit their cemetery because it tells me a lot about the living.\r\n\r\nMy heroes have always been explorers, freethinkers and rebels. It takes guts to stand out from the crowd and loudly proclaim, "I do not think so. I think it is wholly other way round!" However, I must practice what I preach, and that is why I am not a politician.\r\n\r\nHaving said that, I think all people have a responsibility to participate in society and politics. People are herd animals. Democracy is not perfect by any means, but it is all we\'ve got until the next Five Good Emperors come along. By the way, one of the least appreciated and perhaps misunderstood emperors ever probably was Frederick the Great of Prussia. Unfortunately, the Nazis ruined his reputation by association, just like Wagner whose music I like.\r\n\r\nOn the grand scheme of things, ultimately I think the human race will evolve into something like the Borg of the Star Trek. It is a terrible thought, and that is why we, as a race, desperately need new Marcus Aureliuses.\r\n \r\nIf studying philosophy means reading books on my own, then yes I have studied it all my life, but I have not participated in any systematic philosophy teaching or program. I\'d like to quote Groucho Marx on that. He said: "I do not care to belong to any club that will have me as a member." Ironically, now I am applying for membership in the College of Stoic Philosophers. C\'est la vie.\r\n\r\nFor a living, I translate texts, mostly boring business documents with occasional exciting, creative projects. Being bilingual has its moments. For example, seeing people\'s faces when they ask me something in English and I respond in Finnish, or the other way round, as absentminded as I can be some time.\r\n\r\nYes, I do want to think that I am a Stoic. Then I have to make a reality check immediately afterwards. Am I? What does it mean, anyhow? Like Don Quixote, I am still looking for an answer to those questions, and that is why I am sending this request. I want to learn more about Stoicism, and at the same time to understand myself and the mankind better.\r\n\r\nWhat I want from it? Let me put it this way: so far, few years of Stoicism have given me more answers than decades of upbringing in protestant ethics combined.

More I learn about Stoicism, more I am impressed with the wisdom of the Stoics. What appeals to me in Stoicism is its down to earth approach to provide guidance in everyday matters. Stoicism is a comprehensive, serious academic school of philosophy as well, but do not let that fool you.

I first read Seneca\'s essay On the Shortness of Life and then subsequently Meditations by Marcus Aurelius. I most recently have finished reading A Guide to the Good Life by Professor William Irvine and enjoyed it very much. Soon I will be reading the Handbook by Epictetus. \r\n\r\nI would not consider myself an atheist, but perhaps an agnostic. I do believe in some form of a higher power as well as a Holy Spirit. It\'s rather complicated, but although I\'ve never seen a ghost I do believe spirits exist. I also believe Jesus Christ was a real person based on the evidence I have read. Therefore, I believe in the very real possibility of a Holy Spirit. \r\n\r\nHowever, I am not a member of any religious faith. I have attended Protestant Christian churches but do not belong to any particular faith or denomination. I have loosely studied Buddhism and looked into Zen Buddhism in particular, but found it too confusing and not useful. \r\n\r\nI consider myself a Stoic apprentice with a strong desire to continue to learn about myself and to live according to nature. I strongly desire to live the rest of my life in peace and tranquility. This has not often been the case in my troubled life, but at forty two years of age, it seems to becoming more of a possibility now. \r\n\r\nI want to be able to live the rest of my life with a sense of calm and wisdom. To eventually learn to help others who also have the same desires, if not the same background and its troubles, that I have experienced. \r\n\r\nI strongly believe that philosophy, and Stoicism in particular, should be taught in the middle and high schools. With so many broken homes, we have children developing without enough guidance and wisdom. Instead they now get it from friends and colleagues who also come from broken homes or on the internet. \r\nPerhaps even if they still live with both of their parents, one or both are frequently so busy from work to make ends meet, what time do they have to teach their children a philosophy of life? I myself grew up with no such teacher and it has turned out to be sorely missed. \r\n\r\nDuring various times of my adulthood I have suffered from depression, anxiety, anger, and poor physical health. I have at times abused drugs and alcohol to dull the pain I suffered as a child. This has not only made me at times a poor human being and citizen, but more importantly, and sadly, a poor father, son and husband. \r\n\r\nAnd yet, there is still time. Still time to make things right again. With myself, with nature, with my family and the world around me. \r\nI am very interested in learning how to adjust my patterns of thought. "For there is nothing that is either good or bad, but thinking makes it so." I have learned the truth to this statement and often try to be aware of the thoughts that are going through my head and to analyze them. If they are negative, to ask why; to challenge their accuracy. \r\n\r\nI think a long term study and practice of Stoicism would be most beneficial in helping me overcome a negative thought process. I have also practiced Cognitive Behavior Therapy, a direct descendant of Stoic philosophy, to also try to come to an understanding of my thought process and how that shapes my reality.  \r\n\r\nAcademically speaking, I am also considering going back to college to study Psychology and Philosophy with the possibility of opening my own professional practice. This would be a long term and possibly very expensive endeavor, but I believe the marriage of the two disciplines would be not only beneficial to me, but to others who have suffered and suffer still. \r\n\r\nWhether I choose to pursue the academic path or not, it is still my hope to be accepted into the College of Stoic Philosophers. To develop myself and to reach my furthest potential. I would greatly value a mentor/mentee relationship and believe this would be very beneficial to my Stoic studies and practice as well as my development as a human being. To become a better citizen, a better father, and a better son. \r\n\r\nA little over twenty years ago, I took a philosophy class in college on moral ethics. My instructor\'s name was John Fox and to this day I remember that class as well as my instructor well, and the feeling it gave me after our lectures and the subjects we often passionately discussed. \r\n\r\nAt times, my brain literally had a buzzing sensation from all the activity in my brain\'s firing neurons as a result of all of the strong thoughts and emotions. How I long for that sensation again.\r\n\r\nI had no idea of what to do with my life at the time but I recall thinking that I was going to major in Philosophy and/or perhaps English. However I was also not very wise. I was afraid that I would live poor and not make enough money majoring in subjects such as those. \r\n\r\nSo I dropped out of college to find full time work as a laborer. I travelled and worked overseas in Japan and in Alaska, at times narrowly avoiding disaster to my health and even life itself from very foolish decisions and actions. Some great experiences and memories indeed, but I still had not learned a philosophy of life. \r\n\r\nHowever, it\'s of no use repenting the past. I hope now to learn from those mistakes and I try my best to impart that wisdom to my son who is now also facing the same decisions I had twenty years ago. \r\n\r\nAnd yet, fast forward twenty years and I am still financially poor and too often poor in thought and spirit. I still have not learned a philosophy of life. Stoicism would have greatly benefited me then and it would (and does) greatly benefit me now.\r\n\r\nI hope to someday pass that wisdom along to others. Perhaps, someday, I can be a Stoic mentor to someone like me who needs some advice. Someone who needs a philosophy of life. \r\n\r\n~ B. R.

I was born in Rochester, New York and lived there until the age of five. In 1991, my family relocated to Williamsville, New York, a suburb of Buffalo, where my family and I currently reside. I attended High School and graduated in 2004. That same year my best friend died of unexpected heart failure, which selfishly left me lost and rebellious. Upon my graduation I enlisted in the United States Army as a Fire Support Specialist, which is a mix between a Scout, Infantryman, and Radio-operator. I served for six years and did two tours in Iraq followed by an Honorable Discharge. After my service time I was a wandering soul, unable to figure out my true purpose in life. Though I was recently married with a son on the way, my life seemed incomplete. My wife provided me with knowledge and guidance ranging from mythology to the power of the English language when used properly. She has been the light guiding me in the darkness. I know that a family is supposed to fill the void, which to a large extent it has, and provide responsibility and purpose, but I found that my purpose has not yet been discovered. I attended a local Community College, after a short but eye opening trip to Thailand exposing me to Buddhism as a living culture and not just words in a book, only to find the work mundane and pointless providing no real challenge or true knowledge;  just  information. After one and a half semesters I decided to give manual labor a shot. Currently in my fifth month working with ceramic tile, I have found manual labor to be more rewarding in these five months than any traditional academic work I have done in the past. I have come to realize that real work… hard work, entails blood, sweat, and tears. It provides the body with the physical nourishment it desires and gives me a sense of meaning and purpose physically. For me, the time has come to quench my thirst for knowledge and begin my journey toward a virtuous, Stoic life.\r\nI discovered Stoic Philosophy about a year ago by happenstance. I have always been interested in absolute virtue despite not knowing the term back then.  I found myself engaged when it came to various classes in ancient cultures, such as the Samurai, Knights, etc., with their similar ethical common ground such as, living by a code of conduct, virtue and morality above others. Another, more recent student of morality and personal reference of mine when looking towards some guidance, would be George Washington. Currently I am reading a book titled, "The Stoics: A guide for the Perplexed" by M. Andrew Holowchak. This is my first book on Stoicism. Other than this, I have read various articles searched on Google, as well as quotes from Seneca and Marcus Aurelius. \r\nI would consider myself a Theist; understanding that there is only one G-d, but also my understanding is  that "God" is a relative term and used for humans to connect to the Cosmo\'s, Nature, as well as each other. My religion is Judaism, although more along the lines of tradition and culture and less focused on the religion itself.  I am not orthodox in my beliefs but more so in the belief of a G-d and his extreme good will as well as the hardships and tests He puts his children through.  I was not raised with any specific religion, my mother being a Jew and my father a Christian. It was not until after my second tour in Iraq with the United States Military that I really started to become curious about G-d, religion, and philosophy. I have always felt an empty void when it came to that part of my life. I have searched for many years, never truly being satisfied through all my endeavors. I have always found little glimpses of light during any of the curious research I have performed. In the past my interests have been diverse from the Samurai of Feudal Japan to the Knights of Medieval times. Until about a year ago, I had no idea what all of these peoples shared in common, or why I was so fascinated by their way of life and the purpose they approached it with. Until finally concluding it was virtue and morality that made me gravitate toward them. Over the past twelve months or so I have put forth my best effort to live a life of virtue, veering off now and then, unfortunately. I am a student of history and found that history always seems to repeat itself. One significant realization that I have found is that, as history always repeats itself, so do humans. Human beings constantly fall short of their true Nature and of their full potential. To my best understanding, everyone has their own potential and their own purpose, sadly most people fall victim to sorrow, self-indulgence, self-pitty, and tv, wasting the one opportunity to be truly good and great. All I desire is to find my true potential and exercise it wholly and completely to the best of my ability to make our world a better place. As we become more "intelligent" over time, and as technology progresses it provides our current and recent past cultures with laziness, complacency, and a lack of respect for nature. I myself have fallen victim to this. My family and I are in the process of remedying this problem. I have found that after getting married and now with a child and another on the way it is finally about time to take life as seriously as possible, which to me means, living a virtuous life and passing that on to my children, hopefully making this world a better place. That is Stoicism. I just need some guidance, please help!\r\nI would absolutely love to consider myself a Stoic, but unfortunately I feel that at this time I do not deserve that privilege. My goal with the study of Stoicism would be to advance from my own self "study" to actual practice and true study with a guide/mentor. I have been practicing as much as I can and I feel I have gotten to a place where I crave the guidance of a mentor to help with the process. I have reached a plateau with my studies, especially in my search for an experienced elder to help with the process. My research has shown that all throughout history, the most enlightened of people and civilizations almost always provide a large role for the elders and an environment compatible with apprenticeships. Which is exactly what I feel is lacking in my life. Experience has shown me that there is a lack of understanding today in the realm of what it truly is to be a man or a woman in not just society but in the world. I have found myself to be a disciple of the mind and heart over that of brute strength. In return for the guidance and wisdom provided I can offer a life of constant work-in-progress to be passed down to the next generation and beyond to populate this world with a moral code actually worth living for.  Living a life of absolute virtue is very important to me. I do not have much academic background in philosophy, or even much of a background in any sort of traditional higher education, but I am self-educated, for various political, economic, and practical reasons. From this course I hope to progress to the higher learning of the Marcus Aurelius School as well as molding myself to the highest attainable goal of living a life of Virtue.', 1, '', 0, 0, 0, '', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', 1, 0, '', ''),

I\'m the second of three sons.\r\nI\'m born and raised in Gendt, married on 5 september 2005 with Sandra and we\'re living\r\nin the house where she was born.\r\nWe\'ve have two beautiful and adorable children, according to me. The oldest is a boy\r\nnamed Dorus, he is six years old. The youngest is a girl named Dieke and she is five\r\nyears old.\r\nI\'ve studied international economics at the Radboud University in Nijmegen, but i\'ve\r\nallways worked in ICT. I\'m not that much of a tecnical man, but I am very interested\r\nin how information technology can be of value to the world. I\'m a business intelligene\r\nspecialist, which means that I trie to change data into knowledge, which organizations\r\ncan use to support there strategy and processes.\r\nI\'ve allways been more off a thinker then a man of action. Reading books allways has\r\nbeen a great hobby, my interest in books has through the years shifted from books of\r\nwriters like Frederick Forsyth, Ludlum and Ludlum to more philosofical books.\r\nMy first contact with philosophy was a book called \'De logica van het gevoel\' (the logic\r\nof the feeling) by Arnold Cornelis. That must have been twenty years ago. I ran into\r\nthat book when I was having difficulties with my feelings and my self. This must have\r\nbeen about fiftheen years ago. This book has ben very important to me for it helped me\r\nthrough a very difficult time and it opened a complete new world for me, which I could\r\nnot do without any more. Since then philosophy became a major hobby and an important\r\npart of my life. It gives me peace of mind, energy, knowledge and tools to deal with life.\r\nI\'m specially interested in practical philosophy, philosophy that can be of use to man, to\r\nhelp understand the world, life and myself and make it better, more complete. The last\r\nfew years I\'m reading mostly about what the dutch call \'filosofie van de Levenskunst\',\r\nphilosophy as an art of living. I am very fond of Writers like Joep Dohmen, Peter Bieri,\r\nWilhelm Schmidt, Charles taylor. my belief is that everybody at this time should know\r\nand read about this philosophy, because we don\'t really know who we are any more and\r\nwhy we are doing things the way we do. In a way we have lost ourself in the ratrace that\r\nthe consumer society has activated. We keep on running, not knowing why and which\r\ndirection we are running. We don\' t know that it\'s also an option to stop running for a\r\nwhile and think. We are getting more and more individuals who only believe they have\r\nrights and forget that we also have duties and responsibillities, to ourself, our fellow man\r\nand to society. Reading thosd books could open eyes and make people get a better look\r\nat them self and at world as it really is.\r\nOne of my goals for life is to get and keep as close to myself as possible. It\'s a long and\r\nhard process, with ups and downs, but I believe that\'s the best way to have a good live,\r\nto be a good husband, the best father for my children, a good brother and son and a\r\ngood human beeing.\r\nIt\'s a hard way because I haven\'t learned in my youth to talk and think about what I\r\nfeel and think, to express myself, to be who I am. But I\'m on the right track and making\r\nprogess.\r\n\r\nPhilosphy as an art of living is very popular in the Netherlands and lots of new books are\r\nwritten about it. But when reading these books you discover that there\'s not much really\r\nnew in it. All these books have there origin in the ancient philosophers, like Plato, Zeno,\r\nAristotle, Epictetus, Epicurus, Marcus Aurelius.\r\nThat\'s how I got more and more interested in these old philosophers, while at first I\r\nthought that they couldn\'t teach me anything. That\'s old stuff, written in a complete other\r\nworld, can\'t be of any use to us now. What a mistake.\r\nI read and heard RET (Rational Emotive Therapy). RET is interesting for me because I\r\n\r\nhave a lot of unconscious thoughts wich give me negative feelings, mostly about myself,\r\n\r\nand a wrong impression of the world and the others.\r\n\r\nIn 2012 I attended a course at the ISVW, a philosophy school in the Netherlands. the\r\ncourse was about Stoicism. One of the things I learned is that the origin of RET lies\r\nin the old stoic philosophers. That\'s when my interest in Stoicism started. I bought\r\nsome books about RET, two books abou emotions from Miriam van Reijen and a\r\ndutch book about Stoicism called \'Stoische notities\' (Stoic notes) by Rymke Wiersma.\r\nI already had the book of Marcus Arelius (Meditations), the Essays by Montaigne, and\r\nEthica Nicomachea by Aristotles and started reading about and learning of the stoic\r\nphilosphers.\r\n\r\nI don\'t see my self as a stoic yet, but I\'m very interested an enthousiastic to learn of the\r\nstoic philosophers. What I read and learned so far has given me a very good feeling\r\nand has given me already possibillitiesfor change. it\'s my intension to bring the stoic\r\nphilosphy in practice as Much as I can, but that will be a long road and I don\'t know\r\nwhere it will lead me. I will see. Egoistically spoken I hope it will bring me much peace\r\nand happiness. I also hope it wil help me get the best out of my self, making me also a\r\nbetter person, for my direct environment.\r\nThis course will help me get started walking the road, taking the first steps along the way\r\nand will hopefully give me enough foundation to take to road further. I also hope that\r\nby joining The college of stoic philosophers, I get to \'meet\' interesting new people with\r\nwhom I can interact and discuss some problems of life we all will be having.\r\nI hope my English isn\'t to bad, it has been a long time since I wrote much in English.', 1, '', 0, 0, 0, '', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', 1, 0, '', ''),

My mother was an Iowa farm girl of German descent, fourteen years his junior. I was born in the United States in 1991; it was the beginning of a strange upbringing. When I was a child, we shuttled back and forth between homes in Virginia and in Taiwan. Occasionally, we would visit my father\'s family in the Philippines.\r\n\r\nMy parents wanted to homeschool me. My mother taught me to read and write, but beyond that, I got my education mainly from the books and educational computer programs my parents bought for me. Unlike most homeschooled kids, I never had any sort of curriculum to follow. What I learned, I picked up mostly of my own volition. At that time, my father had already quit practicing and was supporting us by selling vitamin supplements and advising parents on how to raise their children\'s intelligence. He worked from home. \r\n\r\nIn 1999, my father moved us to the Philippines to be close to his family. In 2001, he decided to end the "homeschooling" experiment and send us to school. I was nine years old (I started school as a fourth-grader) and had had very little experience in interacting with other children. In addition, I was (and still am) extremely introverted by disposition; when approached by strangers as a toddler, I would point with my finger to signify "Go away!" Making adjustment even more difficult was my complete ignorance of the Filipino language. To top it off, my natural introversion had been reinforced by constant conflict with my parents, of the kind usually associated with the teenage years. I recall once telling my mother that the way she treated me made me want to kill myself. (I was a precocious child.) I felt misunderstood and rejected by the people who were supposed to love me unconditionally, and this made me even more distrustful of others. Briefly, I did not adjust well.\r\n\r\nI spent the next seven years (until recently, primary and secondary education in the Philippines lasted only ten years altogether) doing well academically, though rarely exerting much effort, while making no friends due to the language barrier and my extreme introversion. I\'ve often thought that if I had had language skills, I could have picked up social skills more easily, and vice versa; however, it was not to be. I did become close with a couple of my classmates in senior year, but after that, it was off to college. I immediately fell back on old habits, and as college was a more academically challenging environment and I wanted to graduate with Latin honors, I felt I had little option but to focus on my studies to the exclusion of attempts at socializing. Schoolwork was not my only source of stress at the time; I was also having doubts about my faith.\r\n\r\nMy parents were evangelical Christians, Biblical literalists and creationists. However, for some reason, they allowed me to read books that taught the theory of evolution. My father even agreed to buy me a (secular) book on fossils that I wanted. I remember that when I first encountered the theory, I thought the idea of animals turning into other animals was absurd. The creationist books I read seemed much more convincing. However, as I got older, I began to wonder why so many scientists believed in evolution, and I eventually came to the uncomfortable conclusion that the evidence for it was overwhelming. This was not the only factor in my spiritual struggles. My parents encouraged me to read the Bible, and I read it cover to cover at least twice. Some Old Testament passages, in particular, struck me as being suspiciously human in origin (as opposed to divine). Church, to me, was nothing more than ritual. Our family was not nearly as tight-knit and joyful as a "Christ-centered family" was supposed to be; my parents were constantly fighting in front of us, often in the most childish manner. (I would sit there during these arguments and try to figure out who was right, and in this manner I learned to think critically.) \r\n\r\nAfter I accepted evolution, I tried to find some way of reconciling it with the Bible and with the existence of God, but all the arguments that attempted to do this were unsatisfying. (I have always found liberal interpretations of Christianity far less compelling than fundamentalist ones; they seem to strip God of all personality and power.) One night in 2009, I confided my struggles to my mother, and we prayed about it. Funnily enough, the next morning, our prayer was answered; I knew I no longer believed the Bible, or in Christianity as it was taught to me, and I felt completely at peace about this. I would now describe myself as a naturalistic pantheist, or perhaps a "nonmaterialistic" atheist; I think the word "divine" can be meaningfully used to describe the nature of the constantly changing universe, and I am filled with awe when I reflect that the sea of tiny particles created by the Big Bang contained within itself the potential for life and consciousness. However, I do not attribute consciousness to the universe, at least not of the kind that we have, and I do not worship it or expect it to be favorably disposed toward me.\r\n\r\nAt the end of 2011, my father was diagnosed with late-stage colon cancer. This came as a shock to us. My mom, at the time, had already been suffering from breast cancer for several years; she had refused surgery and chemotherapy in favor of alternative treatments, and my father, despite being a trained medical doctor, supported her in this. My father died in May 2011 and my mother followed in July. I did not grieve their deaths; after all, death is natural and their suffering was over. However, both of them clung to their faith until the end, my mother believing almost until the last that God would heal her; I was furious with God for betraying their trust by not existing. It must have been around this time that I first became interested in Stoicism after I saw a Marcus Aurelius quote on the Internet.\r\n\r\nI graduated from college in October 2011. I had been hoping to go to graduate school, but circumstances meant that I had to figure out a way to earn an income, not just to support myself but also to support my youngest brother, who has Down syndrome. There isn\'t much outside of teaching that you can do with a BS in biology in the Philippines, so I turned to my love of the English language and signed up for an online copyediting course. In November 2012, I obtained a probationary position as copyeditor with a company that edits academic books and journals for big publishing houses. I hope to someday get good enough to go freelance and support myself while I pursue a graduate degree in environmental science; I would like to eventually become an ecologist or sustainability consultant. However, I have serious discipline and motivation problems, and I struggle with depression, apathy, and Internet addiction. I had these problems even before my parents died. I am also still socially awkward and linguistically incapable. \r\n\r\nStoicism attracts me because it offers a way to develop self-control and overcome negative emotions. I have read William Irvine\'s A Guide to the Good Life: The Ancient Art of Stoic Joy, and I own a copy of the Oxford World Classics edition of the Meditations, although I have been remiss in reading it. I have not studied other philosophies in depth, although I hope to do so in future; Eastern philosophy (Buddhist/Hindu/Taoist) particularly intrigues me.\r\nAlthough I desire to be able to practice Stoicism proficiently, I would be reluctant to label myself a Stoic. Labels always diminish the things to which they are applied; besides, I believe in obtaining wisdom wherever it can be found. I am applying to this course because I believe the wisdom contained in Stoicism can be helpful to me. However, there is another reason: I would like to have my own Seneca to give me counsel. My father paid little attention to us at home, and I never felt that he was someone on whose character I would like to model mine; in other words, I have never had a real father figure. I feel I could better deal with the adversity I am currently facing if I had someone understanding to talk to, someone who has faced and overcome troubles like mine, someone with whom I can discuss my most shameful problems without fear of being judged--in short, a mentor; if he is a practicing Stoic, so much the better. I understand that the Stoic College is not in the business of providing therapy. However, if someone from the College were able to help me in this way, I would be eternally grateful.', 1, '', 0, 0, 0, '', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', 1, 0, '', '');

My parents came from small town and rural life.  My mother stayed home to tend the house and children, and my father worked the line at the Ford Assembly plant in St. Paul.\r\n     By the time I reached kindergarten most of my siblings had moved out, except my brother Bob who is special needs.  With the extra money from the other kids being out of the house, my parents enrolled me in a private Catholic elementary school.\r\n     In second grade my friend Jesse told me that, ‘there is no Santa, your parents just dress up.\'  When I asked my mom she said, "What do you think?"  I got the message and went down the line…"Tooth Fairy?, Easter Bunny?, God?"  The last one though she was firm did in fact exist.  From an early age I told myself that my kids would never believe in Santa, but when the time came, I thought otherwise.\r\n     I met my first atheist in Catholic school and later found this more common than one would think.  My first steps on a philosophical journey began at the back of the school bus, when he asked me how I could believe the story of Genesis and Adam and Eve.  I didn\'t have an answer, so it got the wheels turning.\r\n     The teenage years were awkward but normal until my senior year when I had terrible acne.  I was given to anger and despair.  My mom though, took me to a specialist who put me on, what was at the time, ‘experimental\' medicine and slowly it worked.  While I do have some scarring, it is nowhere near others I have seen.  That my mom didn\'t despair, that she didn\'t give up on me, has always been a great example of perseverance.\r\n     The despair abated but the anger remained and I had evolved into an activist atheist.  I was upset that the whole world was being deceived and that all those resources were going to churches rather than finding cures or lifting folks out of poverty.  I found it incredible that people would pray instead of act.  My parents were not pleased, especially with all they sacrificed to put me in private schools.\r\n     Discovering John Lennon, then the Beatles and also finding a nice Catholic girl softened my attitude.  Anger gave way to love and this defined my college experience.  With a more accommodating attitude toward the world, I was able to begin objectively searching for practical knowledge about the workings of logic, science, society and the mind.  One of the greatest classes I took was "Behavioral and Cognitive Science" where human behavior was drawn out in mathematical detail, including falling in love.  All in the universe was truly knowable, at least the physics behind it.\r\n     All through my youth, I had the great fortune to have my friend Greg.  Early on we played "Dungeons and Dragons" which introduced me to ancient mythology and helped me understand that people in ancient times believed as much as the religious people today.  Greg and I were able to discuss everything and anything -- objectively, often playing Devil\'s advocate to one another.  For a short time we created a monthly newsletter called "Common Thought" where we put down and recorded our most profound thoughts.  We are still friends to this day and this friendship has defined me as much as anything else.\r\n     Since an early age, the search for Wisdom and practical knowledge for life has been a constant pursuit.  One could say that I\'ve been interested in Stoicism my entire adult life.  In the mid 1990\'s I came across Marcus Aurelius in college and that\'s when I began to consider myself a student of the philosophy.  I\'ve read Meditations by Aurelius, Letters by Seneca, The Enchiridion by Epictetus and some of his Discourses, Xenophon\'s Socrates and most recently the Guide Book posted on the New Stoa website.\r\n     Twenty years ago I called myself an atheist, much to the dismay of my parents and family.  These days, while I am still an atheist at heart, atheism is not a religion nor a way of life and the community of atheists seemed more interested in tearing religion down than with raising up an alternate approach to life.  For the experience of community life and for the benefit of my children, I am currently a practicing Catholic.  It is important to me, for myself and my family, to hear that we should forgive and that it is our duty to love our neighbor. It is also important to recall that we are part of a universal community on a regular basis.  There is a fair amount of overlap between Catholicism and Stoicism.\r\n     The first philosophy, alternate to Catholicism that I studied was Confucianism and subsequently other Eastern practices.  Once I encountered readings from The Enlightenment though, it has been a steady course to Stoicism.  Since high school I\'ve been writing down pieces of Wisdom I find and collecting them in a book for myself.  This has been my practice now for the past couple of decades and it has been helpful to me.  My personal collection of science, wisdom, quotes and a personal lexicon I call ‘my Constitution.\'\r\n     I definitely consider myself a Stoic.  I believe that our beliefs, actions and will are our only possessions, that we cannot be hurt by others or circumstance without consenting to it, that Virtue is the only good and that as Cicero declared ‘Virtue is Reason fully developed.\'  I believe we are all in this universe together and that those who do harm are somehow mistaking it for something that will bring happiness and are themselves deceived and harmed.  I keep the thought of death close to my mind, especially when times are tough and am grateful for all the good I see in the world and for the bad which hasn\'t happened.\r\n     From this course I would like to gain three things.  First: formalize my training.  Second: improve my daily practice.

I have a passion for almost all areas of knowledge and like to live a very healthy and vigorous life. I guess you could call me an aspiring polymath, or Renaissance Man; trying to become one is certainly a long-term goal I have.\r\nI speak my native Portuguese, fluent English (thanks to my mother, who is an English teacher, and to the internet, that allows me to immerse myself in the language), basic-intermediate Russian, basic German, and I am learning to read and write the Greek alphabet. One of my secondary goals is to learn Ancient Greek, Latin and maybe Sanskrit, so I can delve into the original classic works that shaped our civilizations.\r\n I\'ve had a lifelong interest for ancient history, ever since, at age five, I first played Age of Empires. When I was a child, I was fascinated by Greek mythology, which led me to learn about Ancient Greek culture in general. Back then all I knew of ancient philosophy was the famous trio of Greek philosophers: Socrates, Plato and Aristotle. When I became older, my interest expanded to almost all areas of history, but my interest in philosophy lay dormant, maybe because at school my philosophy classes and teachers were not appealing at all; the classes were a jumble of Marxist indoctrination and shallow "debates" with very few random actual concepts of philosophy thrown in once in a while; suffice to say, it did not do the word "philosophy" justice.\r\n Parallel to that, I have always admired the profession of arms. That\'s not to say I\'m a warmonger; far from that. But, as a kid, I was fascinated by military equipment, such as tanks and planes, and later, as a young man, by the correct attitudes military men always displayed, attitudes considered rare here in Brazil, a country where political corruption and general bad manners among the population are constant in daily life.\r\n During middle and high school, I went through some tough times (what is now called "bullying" by the Politically Correct folks), and had insufficient philosophical resources to put up with it properly, other than sheer force of necessity ("I must endure this; one day it ought to end"). That long episode (it was not exactly intense, but drawn out along the years) took its toll, and left me somewhat disoriented emotionally for a time. I had anger and rancor against my "aggressors" hoarded inside me for two years, until, one day, I decided to let go of it. It worked; I no longer harbored anger. But still I was suspicious, and that suspicion rubbed off on many relationships; it was a challenge for someone to earn my trust. It took some mental training (training without a real method, done by myself) for me to become more open to friendly relationships.\r\n But it was many years later, in 2012, that I first learned the word "Stoicism". I had, in a way, come into contact with the rough idea of Stoicism before knowing its name, through the (debatably Stoic) poems "If", by Rudyard Kipling, and "Invictus", by Ernest Henley. Those poems inspire most young men who read them, I believe.\r\n I learned the word in an unlikely book: The Misplaced Legion, by Harry Turtledove. It is an alternate history book in which the main character is a Roman military tribune, who was raised as a Stoic. I admired the character\'s fortitude, attributed in the book to his Stoic background, and took an interest in learning about Stoicism myself.\r\n I have read Epictetus\'s Enchiridion and Fragments, Marcus Aurelius\'s Meditations (the Jeremy Collier translation and the Maxwell Staniforth translation) and some of Seneca\'s letters. I also read Viktor Frankl\'s "Man\'s Search for Meaning" and part of James B Stockdale\'s "Thoughts of a Philosophical Fighter Pilot". Currently reading William Irvine\'s "Guide to the Good Life". I read the books roughly in the order I listed them.\r\n I subscribe to no organized religion, though I respect them all and try to extract what is good from each. (Basically, I am agnostic in day-to-day life, pantheistic when contemplating the universe and have an undefined and blurry faith in "God" in desperate times :P). I believe religions are perfectly valid and are invaluable when used by people to support themselves (just like someone would use a cane to avoid falling to the ground) against the vicissitudes the world sometimes throws at us, but they are not nearly enough to try to explain the universe and ourselves.\r\n I have not studied any other school of philosophy in depth, I can only loosely name and define some of the main ones and some of the most famous philosophers. I did read some of the works of Albert Camus, namely The Stranger and The Myth of Sisyphus, and found his idea of Absurdism quite interesting. I am also interested in Alexandr Solzhenitsyn (I have not read his work, because it is expensive to buy and import) and Theodore Roosevelt (I know he is not a philosopher, but he shows some virtues I associate with Stoicism), though I have not gotten around to reading much about him yet. I have also had involuntary contact with Marxism, because most Brazilian schools (and academia and the public power) are "infested" with it, and, personally, I despise it, because it counts human beings as being numbers and ciphers, not as the complex and fascinating creatures we are.\r\n I do not consider myself to be a Stoic quite yet, but I am trying to improve myself, because I am aiming to become an Officer in the Brazilian Army, a career that requires character and fortitude (especially during Academy!), which is something I am looking to acquire during my studies of Stoicism.\r\n I want to use this course as a base upon which I will build my philosophical convictions in order to become a more worthy man, more apt to facing the challenges thrown at me.', 1, '', 0, 0, 0, '', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', 1, 0, '', ''),

Fight best in the shade of the cloud of arrows." (Emerson, 10:41) \r\n	\r\nBy nature I am the opposite of "stoic," that is, I tend to react with emotion at the body level to events in my life. I am also a disciplined thinker, and over a long life, as difficult as anyone else\'s life, I have learned to think and fight and take action with a cool head. I would not trade away my passion, my imagination, my creativity, but I am learning that these qualities are best served by a contrasting reserve, an ability to detach from emotions, and a strong philosophical base.\r\n\r\nMy connection to Stoicism is recent, although without knowing it I have been working at becoming a stoic for at least 50 years. A small brown pamphlet containing The Enchiridion was my first "Stoic book": Epictetus spoke to me, as Emerson said, in "words like cannonballs." The first sentence of Higginson\'s translation of The Enchiridion states: "There are things which are within our power, and there are things which are beyond our power." For me, this boils it down to the clean bare bones of what we need to know in life. The simple power of it! Nothing is in my control beyond my attitude and my actions. I am looking to this course in Stoicism to sharpen my perception of what is, and what is not, in my control; to learn how to avoid the tentacles that reach out for us every day, the attempt by others to capture us with their need, the clamor of the world, selling, dealing, wanting--Already, in practicing this precept, I am becoming a moving target, harder to hit, as I learn to neither suffer nor take arms against the "slings and arrows of outrageous fortune." \r\n\r\nReligion in the formal sense has never been a support for me, although I believe there is a spiritual animation in everything material. I suppose I am a pantheist. Religion has much to offer for those who take comfort from the mythology of, for example, Christianity. Out of admiration for the wisdom of the Bible, and the ideas of thinkers and believers from St. Paul to Thomas Merton, I have tried to connect with the Christian faith, but, for me, there is too much pressure to suspend disbelief, to ignore history, and trade the mind\'s autonomy for the dictates of faith. In contrast, Stoicism seems to offer personal redemption and peace through reason, without discounting our need to connect, in our own way, with the unknowable world of spirit.\r\n\r\nIn the ancient world exile was a form of punishment and a way of dealing with difficult persons. Old age is a kind of exile. To be old is to long for home, for love, for lively conversation, for wit and irony, for community. It\'s just vanity, but I don\'t like being separated forever from the desirable creature I once was. However, I believe that as we age the greatest gift we can give to our family is our dignity, our happiness with life, and our ability to go through our own death without complaining. I aspire to get old with class; no one likes a whiny old lady! To quote A. A. Long, "death, exile, poverty, grief, anger, and old age" . . . . [are no] "impediments to happiness" (p. 48). In recent years, through death and loss and aging, I have lost my bearings and allowed fear to occupy too much of my thoughts. This course in Stoicism will strengthen my determination to be useful in the world, to learn to accept this place of exile as my new and happy home. In recent months I have already noticed that my relationships are improving, just by keeping my feelings to myself!\r\n	\r\nIf everything that has happened in my life is in accord with my nature, then what are the events of my life trying to tell me? I desire to account for myself in some rigorous manner; I seek the discipline of Stoicism to clear my head and strengthen my voice. I would like a mentor to talk with, but if such is not to be found, I will pretend I am sitting in Epictetus\' circle with Arrian and the young warriors. \r\n	\r\n In the postmodern fog of self-help, pop psychology, a certain oily and insincere "sensitivity," useful concepts such as "judgment" and "discrimination" have grown new and pejorative definitions. In a culture where you rarely hear the words honor and courage, the words of the Stoics are comforting. "Comforting" may sound like a strange idea, as the usual thing is to say is that such words are "bracing" "a breath of fresh air," but I believe that nothing comforts like a stab of truth.\r\n\r\nAs a newcomer to philosophy (except that which I have absorbed in a lifetime of reading,) when I share an insight about Stoicism I may be like the child who says, "Daddy, Daddy, did you know the world is round?" So at the risk of being that child, it came as a new thought to me that the words of America\'s Bill of Rights are misunderstood: the "pursuit of happiness" has come to mean the "pursuit of pleasure," because our citizens don\'t realize that our founders were students of the Greeks and defined happiness as Epictetus would. Happiness is a side effect of discipline and the pursuit of virtue and service, much as a strong and flexible body is a side effect of playing tennis.\r\n\r\nReading Epictetus led me to Marcus Aurelius and Seneca, and their modern interpreters. My ancient "friends" remind me to notice what is around me, to be grateful for what I have rather than regretting what I have lost. Stoic philosophy reminds me that I have a spine.\r\n\r\nIn meeting the Stoics, I recall a dream I had many years ago. In the dream I am walking down a familiar street, when I am attracted to a narrow stone stairway that leads to a door below street level. The door is heavy, old darkened wood, banded with iron, with an iron latch. I am struck at how short the door is, and I have to bend over to walk through it.\r\n	\r\nInside is a large room of plank walls, a plank floor, lit by a fireplace and oil lamps. I sit down at the end of a long table at which are seated 7 or 8 men wearing robes. Some have beards; before each of them is some sort of a tankard that I can\'t quite see. They ignore me, or perhaps they don\'t see me, I can\'t tell which. At times they are jovial, then serious: arguments begin in high seriousness and end in laughter. Drinks are refilled; hours pass. But, try as I might, I cannot understand what they are saying. They are speaking a language I don\'t know; sometimes I can see their lips moving but I can\'t hear their words.\r\n	\r\nFor years I have imagined these men in my mind\'s eye; I have stretched out on my back on the floor in a dark room, closed my eyes, and asked them to speak to me, for I need to hear what they have to tell me.\r\n\r\nMaybe in this new/ancient world of Stoicism I can at last hear their words at last.\r\n\r\nReading List\r\n\r\nAurelius, M.

Many humanist practices are akin to how Stoics approach life and its challenges. Humanism, however, is not as close-knit a philosophy as Stoicism, and Marije has  long searched for a thinking model that does encompass life, the universe, and everything. Finding Stoicism was therefore like returning  after a long journey, and all of her life seems to have been a preparation for this homecoming.\n\nShe had been interested in philosophy for at least twenty years before she settled upon Stoicism. The realization that life is short and precious, and the absence of any form of religion in her upbringing, combined with the desire to lead a good life, led her to focus especially on Art of Life philosophy.  Besides philosophy she has always been interested in psychology, and is fascinated by the way our feelings and thoughts influence our actions. As Marije learned more about Stoicism, she discovered that the Stoic focus on psychology was founded on a thorough contemplation of the very foundations of life, encompassed in a model of, indeed, life, the universe and everything, and leading to a set of relatively simple life rules. These rules, when followed, promise to lead to a sense of fulfillment no matter what one\'s life circumstances. This is what Marije found in Stoicism: the love and awe for Nature as the basis of all our thinking, the understanding that man is both a social and rational animal and can only find happiness through perfecting himself as such.  Stoicism is now her compass by which to steer through life.\n\nMarije followed the SES course and completed the MA school, and is a Fellow of the College of Stoic Philosophers.\n\nMarije started her professional life as a linguist and academic researcher, but after ten years retrained as an artist.

Our sense of time differs from the American sense of time!\r\nThank you for considering my application.', 'So who am I? My name is formally spelled Ioannis, though colloquially people call me Yanni. Demographically speaking, I am a thirty year old, single, male. Two parents, two brothers, one dog.\r\n\r\nI live in Thessaloniki, the second largest city of modern Greece. Everyday I walk on the city\'s lengthy promenade and look at Mt. Olympus that is situated on the other side of the Thermaic gulf. I walk past ancient Greek, Roman, and Byzantine ruins, statues of Aristotle, Alexander the Great, and other interesting figures of the ancient era. In ancient cities like Thessaloniki you cannot avoid ruins nor can you avoid thinking about them. And although I can\'t support the following claim with much evidence, I think that paying attention to this sort of physical environment on a daily basis leads you to develop either artistic or philosophical tendencies. At the  very least I think it heightens one\'s awareness of and sensitivity to the inevitability of decay, death, and what appears to be the eternal flow of time. Maybe that\'s why we modern Thessalonikians like relaxation and stresslessness so much. We are famous for it here in Greece. The meaninglessness of life, the inevitability of decay, and the futility of human effort is more obvious in Thessaloniki, than places like New York. Plus we have clear skies and see the stars most months of the year. Thus, cosmic and philosophical inquisitiveness has always been a natural trait for those inhabiting these lands.\r\n\r\nI am, however, pretty much, a modern European. Greek from my father\'s side and British from my mother\'s. I went through the Greek educational system up to the age of eighteen, and then moved to the UK where I read psychology at Bangor University in Wales, and obtained a master\'s degree in marketing as well as a postgraduate diploma in research methodology from Strathclyde Business School (SBS) in Glasgow, Scotland. I was then hired to teach on the undergraduate marketing course of the SBS. I worked as tutor for four years while I pursued part-time doctoral research on the consumer behaviour of British Muslims. In parallel, I obtained a certificate of Islamic studies at the University of Glasgow, volunteered as a press assistant at the Scottish Refugee Council, worked part-time as an adviser to the university\'s career service, and designed teaching material for a marketing textbook published by Palgrave-Macmillan.\r\n\r\nWith the UK economy in recession I was made redundant in September 2009 and had to terminate my doctoral studies as I could no longer support myself financially. I moved back to Greece as it was said that Greek banks were not exposed to toxic derivatives and would remain safe and secure from the effects of the US housing crisis. However, in autumn of 2009 the newly elected Greek government revealed huge sums of hidden national debt and announced that the budget deficit was five times what the previous government was claiming. The nation was shocked, and so was I. With the EU and IMF taking over the country and imposing an unimaginable austerity plan, a sense of helplessness, loss, and desperation took over the majority of the population. I was no exception. \r\n\r\nFor the last four years, I have been struggling as an independent marketing consultant, living with my parents, and watching the social, political, and economic surroundings deteriorate rapidly. The job market, national GDP, and wages have shrunk beyond belief destroying people\'s disposable income and many businesses along the way. Taxes are suffocating society and home owners are being heavily taxed irrespectively of whether they are unemployed and in debt. Crime is up and so are suicides, mental illness, poverty, the far left, and the far right. In economic terms this is a depression, not merely a  recession (five continuous years in recession, plus 30% unemployment). In parallel, I have faced a number of personal and family misfortunes, and seen many of my closest friends immigrate in search of a job abroad. As I am not religious to turn to a religious community, nor talented in any way to turn to artistic creation, and since I am not sufficiently stupid to turn to political fanaticism, I decided to turn to reading. A few years ago, Stoic philosophy caught my attention for good. \r\n\r\nMy interest in stoicism didn\'t develop through the Greek educational system as one might have expected. In fact it developed through my interest in Diogenes and Cynicism, which had in turn developed through my interest in sixties US counterculture. The link between US counterculture and Diogenes appeared in a book called "Hippies and Cynics", which drew my attention a long time ago and which was written by a Greek professor of philosophy in the US named Jason Xenakis. I read this book nearly a decade ago. Over the years I read a few cynic philosophy collections and analyses of Diogenes\' life and his philosophical stance. After I reread these books four years ago,  I discovered references to the works of Epicurus and Lucretius, and read books on Epicurean philosophy for a while. I then discovered the philosophy of the stoics and  sceptics. Initially I read a lot of peripheral literature that briefly discussed the stoics and then I moved on to some anthologies of stoic thought and criticism that I found in Greek, English, and even in Spanish  (since my  Spanish always seems to need more practice). Recently, I engaged in quick readings of the core texts: Musonius Rufus, Epictetus, Marcus Aurelius, Seneca, and a selection from Cicero\'s works. I have since been collecting works on stoicism, as I have found that this is the viewpoint from which I wish to view the world for the rest of my life. My book collection is quite significant though I have not yet read most of these books (just thought I better start buying them off Amazon in case Greece leaves the Eurozone and returns to a devalued  new drachma). \r\n\r\nToday, I think that Stoicism is the deepest approach to the real-life practise of reason, the best emotion management system, and the most effective road to true wisdom. It is the authentic CBT with so much more to it. Just the mental association with these amazing fellows (Epictetus, Marcus Aurelius, and Seneca) is a privilege and a treat to the mind. I would like to make stoicism my constant mental operating system and have the cognitive framework permanently engrained in the neurological network that forms my memory. I want to develop a more permanent sense of stoic perception as well as stoic behaviour patterns and habits, through a self inflicted stoic brainwashing and frequent interaction with like minded people. In essence, I don\'t want to just talk about stoicism, but I want to be a stoic in the deeper sense, practice stoicism, live a stoic existence, and die stoically. What I fear most is a delusional life, emotionally overwhelmed and out of control, which may conclude with a fearful and desperate death (a subconscious remnant of a misinterpreted Christian upbringing). A death that would lack the sober sense of grateful indifference that I believe the stoics would advocate. Thus, I believe that continuous personal study, habitual stoic practice, as well as interaction and debate with the international stoic community, are the way to securely achieve these goals and enjoy my life in the process. \r\n\r\nMy religious views are somewhat complex. I am not a member of a religious faith though I was brought up in a Greek Orthodox and Anglican-Protestant household. I do not believe in the Jesus myth nor do I adhere to any religious dogma. I have mixed feelings about the social and historical effects of many of the great religions especially the Abrahamic faiths and Hinduism. However, I will never argue with a person of faith nor insult him or her intentionally. I am deeply libertarian in my social views and love liberty, plurality of opinion, and freedom of speech even though I disagree with a lot of what is being said most of the time. Plurality of opinion gives us the joy of debate and conversation. And debate gives us something to do while we wait in line for lady death to do what she does best (Ginsberg called him father death, but I prefer the sexier Bukowskian term). After all, I too am often wrong and irrational -- something I try to monitor as best I can. Generally though I avoid arguments with believers and atheists. An example of my occasional irrationality is that in times of great stress or worry I might surrender my reason to internal helpless prayer, though I am conscious that this is an irrational psychological need and I know that this behaviour has its roots in my early development, schooling, and general upbringing. But I am not an atheist. I am an agnostic. I see the metaphysical world as a locked room that we humans don\'t have access to. Thus, I don\'t believe in descriptions of its contents, as nobody can know what is going on in there. I am sceptical even about the validity of the \'locked-room\' metaphor I just used. All I can say about this matter is that I don\'t know. I think Socrates would approve. \r\n\r\nAt this point however, it seems reasonable to mention that I find descriptions by cosmologists and theoretical physicists quite interesting and also enjoy Taoist writings and classical Chinese poetry too, as they all touch upon notions of the eternal, the everlasting, and the universal. I find these notions beautiful and relaxing in an abstract way. But when it comes to the theism-atheism debate, I am not tempted to take a stance about something that I am convinced we can know nothing about. However, the transcendentalism and spirituality in works of writers such as Emerson, Thoreau, Herman Hesse, Henry Miller, certain Beat generation writers, and Sufi poetry is also quite alluring at times. I also have sympathy towards the unquestionably uber-human Christian notion of true altruism and love and Buddhist ideas of compassion, mindfulness, selflessness, as well as eastern techniques of breathing and meditation. At the same time, I find merit in Max Stirner\'s notion of selfishness, and the anti-Christian individualism of Nietzsche and even Ayn Rand. I believe they express a natural truth, a truth that is often unpopular to the civilized virtuous individual, the Christian, or the idealist, but which in practice would increase one\'s chances of physical survival in the wild or in times of war and hardship. But, to sum up, I would describe myself as a fanatic agnostic claiming that one cannot know anything about what lies in the metaphysical sphere, and would agree with Henry Miller when he uses the colourless yet meaningful word \'it\' to describe god/fate. He says somewhere in his works, that one should relax and "let IT decide, for IT knows best". For me "it" is a good way of referring to the unknowable and uncontrollable metaphysical world, which is after all part of the sphere that Epictetus would urge us not to focus on. Yet, I think that religions may be emotionally useful to those who have not yet encountered reason and stoicism, and I cannot argue against those who choose to believe in certain dogmas or those who have been brainwashed into them through constant indoctrination from family and other social institutions. Religions do offer a few usually useful heuristics to live by (e.g. Delphic maxims, ten commandments, five pillars of Islam etc). They offer social community and a sense of belonging. They also offer a pretty strong sense of meaning and hope to the extremely desperate and unbelievably unfortunate who have close to nothing in this life under their control (sometimes not even their mind). After all, delusion is often very practical as William James\' philosophy of pragmatism would advocate. In the words of Charles Bukowski, "endurance is more important than truth". This, I believe, has always been the unspoken mantra of the masses. Just as truth has mostly been the concern and privilege of the literate, healthy, adequately fed, and fairly comfortable minorities. At present I believe that the ideal mental cocktail is as follows: Stoicism together with agnosticism, a practice of mindfulness meditation, social libertarianism, and a twist of selective  love, compassion, and mutual aid. These, I think, form the best possible cure for dealing with the pain of the human situation and for rationally enduring all that comes our way in this unpredictable and meaningless world, in this pretty sad  \'community of the dying\' that the human community has always been.\r\n\r\nWhat I aim to get from this course is a structured approach towards the deeper study of Stoicism and the core Stoic texts as well as further interaction and debate with a more developed fellow stoic. I see it as a stepping stone towards further engagement with the stoic community. As I often lose motivation and also suffer from frequent instances of akrasia, existential angst, paralysing meaninglessness, procrastination, and weak self-control, I wish to strengthen external motivation factors by formally committing to the study of stoicism. I think that it could be the lack of stoic institutions and the historical prosecution of the Stoas that destroyed the possibility of the prevalence of stoic philosophy in the western world and exposed people to the unprecedented levels of emotional instability/disability, self-delusion, and irrationality that we see today. I think a sense of community would be very helpful in order to establish stoicism as a dominant philosophical stance inside ourselves and within society. It is the lack of interaction with other stoics that makes living stoically that bit more difficult. We are, after all, social animals. So, I wish to participate in and expand the stoic revival, as this will contribute to humanity\'s progress and my personal emotional well-being as well as that of other people. Overall, I believe the process and structure of the course will help me to direct my reading, organise my reflections, put them in writing, identify key sections from the texts, as well as internalize and memorize some of the key lines and passages so as to build solid foundations on which I can establish a deeper and more permanent stoic being and lifestyle.\r\n\r\nP.S. 1 Somewhere in the back of my mind, I can picture an international stoic meeting in northern Greece with hikes up Mt Olympus, swims in the Greek seas, readings of Marcus Aurelius at Greek and Roman archaeological sites and ruins, readings of Epictetus at the Thessaloniki international airport when your luggage never arrives, constant repetitions of Seneca\'s \'On Anger\' in chaotic driving situations, and   plenty of examples of akratic behaviour in Greek taverns. \r\n\r\nP.S. 2 As previous postscript referred to the unpredictable future, we might have to change some of the group activities to marathon running (away from angry mobs, the police, or the army) and  javelin-style throwing just like in the Olympic games (but with the modern Greek alternative: molotov cocktails). Mind you, we may still be able to visit Mt Olympus (in hiding from urban civil unrest) and may even camp there permanently if you want (a good way of putting some of those stoic techniques to proper use). \r\n\r\nP.S. 3 I\'m not sure if this "Know Thyself" essay has touched on the right things. It definitely seems quite wordy. But what else can I include? I don\'t know. Maybe that I like reading, walking, and drinking tea, coffee, and cheap beer. That I like making useless and useful things out of stuff I find on the street. And conversations. I like conversations with interesting people a lot. And I dislike mobile phones that are constantly turned on, stressful situations, careerism, corruption, competitive relationships, lack of a sympathetic temperament, bad lawyers, bad doctors, bad politicians, nearly all bankers, religious, political, and soccer fanatics, technological neo-maniacs, and people with comsumeritis, gadgetitis, or who simply like too much of the stuff that\'s popular at any given moment. Maybe I could include a list of minor worries, insecurities, bodily malfunctions and other things that are not really under my control but which depress  me every few weeks. Like the annoying bunion on my left foot, or the haemorrhoids on... well, never mind! Or maybe I could just say that I like constructive idleness,  dogs that wag tails and don\'t bite, Mediterranean tortoises that live longer than us and are walking around stoically all over Greece right at this very moment indifferent to crazy Greek drivers, or that I like bongos, acoustic guitars, the thought of becoming a successful non-fiction writer, bears, elephants, bookshops, pocket radios, sleeping, political liberty and financial independence, the occasional cigarette, penknives, girls that are outside my league, a few that are in my league, old English graveyards with old carved tombstones, the view of the sea from the shore, sunsets, trees and forests, the sun, mountains, the sky at night, archaeological sites and ruins, the feeling of eating anything after long periods of not eating, a trip to Britain (it sometimes reignites my love for Greece), solitude, family, surfing on the internet, wooden worry beads, good food in general, instrumental music from the east, classical music and jazz, having money in my pocket, the idea of running a successful small business, cheap jeans, black shirts, bicycles, small 4x4 vehicles, looking at and talking to backpackers, quiet cafeterias, honey and the idea of bee keeping, music from the late sixties and early seventies, reggae, the idea of being a war correspondent or a photojournalist (but not the reality of it), having friends that are considerate, understanding, tolerant of my peculiarities and weaknesses and good conversationalists, but most of all I like playing around with the techniques of stoicism in my mind and in my life, taking control of my desires and my emotions, and feeling happy and content for as long as the serene ataraxia lasts. Should you take away everything but stoic philosophy from my life, I might still make something of it. Or I might just kill myself. Just kidding. I also like people with a sense of humour (though mine can get overly liberal at times). \r\n\r\nThis is over 3000 words: sincere apologies for putting you through this -- the suicide hotline is 1155321. Remember: life is good! Though stoicism has no moral problem with you pulling the trigger, does it? Let\'s talk about it. I\'m ready for this course and think it will be an interesting experience, a real  education, and an opportunity to enter a state of flow and deeper awareness through the methodical study of this true philosophy.', 1, '', 0, 0, 0, '', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', 1, 0, '', '');

My family were nondenominational Christians. I was Baptized at age 13 at First Baptist Church in Texas City. Having been an artist in a family of artists, I chose Fine Art as my major when I attended Sam Houston State University in Huntsville, Texas. Throughout the course of my college years I went through a transformation in my beliefs as I carefully reconsidered them.\r\n\r\nI graduated in 1994 and moved to Houston, where I got work as a graphic artist for Southwestern Bell, working in their yellow pages division. At this time I became an atheist and what I would later learn was called Humanism. Thereafter, in about 1998, I founded and Chaired a Humanist organization, the Houston Secular Humanists (HSH). We promoted Humanism, reason, science, and performed some charitable work over the next few years.\r\n\r\nIn 1998 I met Julie Mize and she helped me in running HSH. In 2001 we married and moved to the San Francisco Bay Area, to the small town of Walnut Creek, California. HSH soon after merged in with the Humanists of Houston (HOH). We lived there until 2005 and over that time we were not very active in Humanism or any other philosophical pursuits. Julie was busy with school, getting her degree in Physics, and I was busy working at B.R. Funsten & Co. flooring distributor; eventually migrating from graphics into Marketing Director.\r\n\r\nIn 2005 Julie finished school and got a job offer with a large subsea engineering company, Oceaneering, back in Houston. We also had many friends and family still in that area so we returned to Houston, where we have lived until today. I became Marketing Director at the Medical Benevolence Foundation (MBF), a non-profit organization that helps deliver food and medical care to people in developing nations. I also became President of HOH and resumed my work in Humanism. I became a Humanist Minister, certified by the American Humanist Association. As such I conducted many weddings and some funeral services.\r\n\r\nBut it was from 2005 until about 2010 that I underwent the most remarkable spiritual journey of my life. I had come to the realization that, although the general principles of Humanism are very noble, and were excellent guides for community involvement in larger social issues; they were not robust enough to provide real guidance on a day to day basis for personal living.\r\n\r\nI had always been interested in philosophy and so, during this period, I began a very intense hobby of philosophical reading and writing. This eventually lead me to ancient philosophy, where my life became a series of amazing epiphanies. As I learned more about how the Greeks, for example, lived their philosophy I began to understand how a spirituality could exist, even within my naturalistic worldview. I also came to appreciate that intellectual assent and information was not enough -- that putting a philosophy into practice was essential to cultivation of a character that is necessary to experience a flourishing life. Before long, similarities lead me to Buddhism and then to Taoism, and for several of these years (continuing today) I have been conducting comparative studies between this perennial thread or path that both West and East appear to touch upon, mostly with Stoicism and Buddhism respectively.\r\n\r\nIn the earlier part of this process, I decided to help move Humanism more toward including these sources of wisdom and practices. I created a club and a website called the Humanist Contemplative Club within HOH. We met locally and I wrote The Humanist Contemplative as a blog. Eventually, Rick Heller at the Humanist Chaplaincy at Harvard was inspired by this to start a Humanist Contemplatives group there.\r\n\r\nI also became involved with the International Stoic Forum. These conversations were crucial to my learning about Stoic philosophy. It was there that I (virtually) met Erik Wiegart. I helped design some graphics for the Stoic Registry and briefly served on the Stoic Council at New Stoa.\r\n\r\nEventually, I came to realize that there was a much wider demographic that could relate to these naturalistic forms of spiritual practices than just Humanists. It seemed that, with the rise of naturalism, there were naturalistic ends of the spectrum rising within philosophical Buddhism, Humanistic Judaism, Stoicism, Taoism, Paganism, and even Christianity. So, no longer serving as President of HOH, I founded the Spiritual Naturalist Society (SNS), a separate national/international organization that is dedicated to promoting all forms of naturalistic spirituality and its practices. As I consider myself a Stoic, we feature many Stoic documents and teachings in our educational archives for members, as well as our public articles.\r\n\r\nI have been pleased to see the work of the New Stoa over the past few years, even if I have been too with the Society to participate much. But I have also been interested in the College and I think it would be a good idea for me to undergo this program.\r\n\r\nTo answer remaining questions asked on your website:\r\n\r\nI have been interested in Stoicism since about 2005 (8 years). I have read:\r\n- The Spiritual Teachings of Marcus Aurelius, Mark Forstater\r\n- Meditations, Marcus Aurelius\r\n- Stoicism, John Sellars\r\n- The Stoic Art of Living, Tom Morris\r\n- The Hellenistic Philosophers, Vol 1 (sections on Stoicism), A.A. Long & D.N. Sedley\r\n- A Guide to the Good Life: The Ancient Art of Stoic Joy, William Irvine\r\n- Pieces of many other books, essays, and web articles\r\n\r\nAlthough I technically count as an atheist (being \'without theism\' in the common sense), I do not choose to use that word because I prefer positive words that describe what I do believe rather than what I don\'t. My primary identifier these days is Spiritual Naturalist. Though I also simultaneously fall in the categories of: Humanist, Stoic, Buddhist, Taoist, agnostic, and skeptic.\r\n\r\nBeing a naturalist, I would no longer count as a Christian by most people\'s account, though I certainly appreciate many of the moral teachings of the figure of Jesus. Some consider Humanism and/or Spiritual Naturalism a religion and, if so, then I would be a member of these. I, however, do not find much use in the word \'religion\' as it doesn\'t seem to communicate much by itself, so I leave it up to each person whether or not to consider my views or community a \'religion\'.\r\n\r\nI hope, out of this course, to be enriched by the additional perspectives of my mentor, to be refreshed in anything I might have forgotten or misunderstood, and to know that I had at least submitted myself at some point to the tutelage of others (besides my conversation on the I.S. forum), rather than merely relying on my own understanding.', 1, '', 0, 0, 0, '', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', 1, 0, '', ''),

In addition to these works, I have read some of Epictetus\' Discourses, Musonius Rufus\' Lectures and Sayings, and a good bit Seneca\'s essays and letters. Of secondary material, I\'ve read Seller\'s Stoicism, Irvine\'s A Guide to the Good Life, Stock\'s Stoicism, and a lecture, "The Stoic Philosophy" by Gilbert Murray (which actually had the best 3 pages on Phusis I have read). I taught a course on Stoicism a couple of years ago which was very well received by students. It really seemed to have the ability to impact them in their real lives. I am also familiar with other classical philosophers including Herakleitos, Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, Diogenes, Cicero, and Boethius.\r\n	I am a theist. I am a convert to Roman Catholicism. I was a raised a Protestant (on the fundamentalist end of the spectrum), became something like an atheist somewhere in college, and moved back towards faith when writing my dissertation. That work was focused on American Transcendentalism and Pragmatism. While reading some theological critics of Pragmatism, I realized they talked more directly and profoundly about the topics that most interested me than did my current heroes. I had also flirted with Marxism, Nietzsche, Existentialism, and Post-Structuralism. My path back came via Plato and several German theologians. I tend towards natural and rationalistic theology (I fear I tend towards Deism). I am also interested in the Traditionalist school of comparative religion. My theological heroes are St. Paul (who has some Stoic tendencies), Justin Martyr, St. Benedict, St. Augustine, St. Anselm, Pascal, Evelyn Underhill, C.S. Lewis, Paul Tillich, Thomas Merton, and Huston Smith. \r\n	I studied Political Theory in graduate school and have taught Political Theory and then Philosophy for over 20 years as an adjunct professor. My full-time job is in the human service field; I\'m an Assistant Director of an agency that provides services to individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities. Philosophically, I consider myself a \'near Platonist,. My philosophical heroes are the author of Ecclesiastes, Confucius, Socrates, Plato, Diogenes the Cynic, Epictetus, Aurelius, Erasmus, Tom Paine, Thoreau, Booker T. Washington, and Tolstoy. I also have an interest in Taoism. The things that interest me the most about Stoicism include:\r\n•	its practicality;\r\n•	it is an example of philosophy as a way of life;\r\n•	it\'s consoling when life is hard;\r\n•	it strengthens the character;\r\n•	its notion of providence;\r\n•	and its simplicity.\r\n	At this point in my life I have only a passing concern for \'academic\' philosophy. I am mainly interested in Wisdom and its practical implications for life. Concepts that are of most concern to me include wisdom, logos, virtue, reason, character, aspiration, and faith. I sometimes think of myself as a hopeful pessimist. A pessimist because I feel our culture is pretty much a ship wreck spiritually, ethically, environmentally, aesthetically, politically, economically, and psychologically. Hopeful because I believe the basis of existence is goodness (the Good) and though we may have no reason to expect it, ontologically we can trust that goodness will necessarily prevail and we can act in light of this.\r\n	The two greatest influences on me in my life have been my father and a professor I had in grad school. My father had pretty much run his life into the ground by the time I was a pre-teen. He was a very desperate man. He found his way out of that through religious faith. He would spend hours every night for a period of years studying the Bible for answers. Eventually his life was radically transformed and he is an example to me of honesty, integrity, seriousness, faith, and industry. He taught me that there are serious questions in life, deadly serious questions, and that intent study and application of what one learns to one\'s life is a way of addressing those questions. The professor was a Harvard educated \'Great Books\' guy. He taught me that some books are really great, that we should focus our attention on those, and how to study them. While most of my life has been lived in the world of family and work, I have always remained a student and have always weighed what I study by the demands of life and always interpreted the challenges and opportunities of life by my studies.\r\n	My intellectual preferences are fairly eclectic, but I believe all reflect my interest in wisdom, meaning, criticism, and philosophy as a way of life. I would accept the labels of \'Platonist\', \'Christian\', and \'philosopher\'. \'Stoic\'? Not sure I have enough chutzpah. I suppose I would share an animosity towards Epicureanism though. The label I would probably apply to myself at this point is \'religious humanist\'. I am very interested in grounding thought in the transcendent (religion/ontology) and believe the measure of things is the quality of fully human life they produce (humanism), and that the latter is best achieved via the former.\r\n	What interests me about the prospect of launching on this course of study is to do so with a mentor (reflecting the methods of the classical schools), to further explore the extent to which I can claim Stoicism as a guiding philosophy in my life, and explore how compatible (or incompatible) it is with my other intellectual and spiritual affinities. I have not formally been in the role of student (other than student of my great dead masters) for about 20 years and I find that prospect exciting and this opportunity viable given the various constraints on my life at this point.\r\n	Along the way I have picked up an interest in classic detective fiction (about the only fiction I can stomach besides some poetry, myths and epics), folk and traditional music, and movies (mainly action, thrillers, and fantasy). Politically, I increasingly don\'t fit comfortably anywhere in the current terrain. I am a husband and father, and though I have not really mentioned that in this essay, those are really the most defining aspects of my existence.', 1, '', 0, 0, 0, '', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', 1, 0, '', ''),

Currently I live in New York City.   Previously I worked in silicon valley at Oracle.  I have an internet business interview site, one of the first on the web, called http://MeetInnovators.com  This has enabled me to build quite a large business network worldwide.\r\n\r\nMy forte has been working in the affiliate marketing space, which is what I was involved in up until around 2008.  Things went well and I’ve been retired since then; and relocated to NYC, where I’ve been for 3 years.  I was previously living in the caribbean and after being back in the US I think overall I’m more suited to living outside the US, I’ve become quite libertarian and find the idea of the state regulating our lives to be a little uncomfortable.\r\n\r\nI’m 41, single, and looking to find a place I want to live the rest of my life.  My goal while growing up has always been to build a billion dollar business, however I’ve lost some of that motivation, in realising that my REAL goal is what the libertarians talk about as “liberty”.  That sounds like a corny phrase in today’s stigmatized world, but what it means is absolute freedom to do and think as you feel.  Growing up as a nerdy 12 year old, the only way I could really envision freedom was becoming a billionaire.  Today I still think its possible, however I have an easier shortcut available - just to move to a nice place in the caribbean and work online, something which is very easy for me to do.  \r\n\r\nI plan on traveling to Panama and a few other countries very shortly to check them out for quality of life.  I’d return to Santo Domingo where I previously lived, however the constant electrical failures make it a place too difficult for me to work online.  My network of friends has suggested Panama as the best option, and since I’m very interested in bitcoin, the combination of finance and caribbean living could be a good option for me.\r\n\r\nSo I’ll soon be passing through another transition point in my life.\r\n\r\nI’ve been interested in Stoicism for about 6 months, after hearing about it from Nassim Taleb (author of “antifragile”).  I’m in the tech community and I keep noticing geeks talking about stoicism on reddit as being helpful.  I’m much less comfortable with Plato and other philosophers who are more focused on emotion.  I like rigorous logic.\r\n\r\nSo far I’ve read half of “meditations” by Marcus Auerelius, and I found it profoundly insightful.  In fact I relaxed a lot last night and had the best sleep in a long time.  I’ve heard that CBT is based on stoicism and it was clear what I learned was about controlling my thinking more effectively.  I’ve also been very impressed that meditations is not politically correct - he’s telling us exactly how it is.  I think this resonates with me far more powerfully than if it was filtered.\r\n\r\nI’ve also watched Tim Ferriss’s presentation on practical pessimism, and have applied the ideas myself:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Ui_nflxkA\r\n\r\nI have the John Sellars Stoicism book which I have begun browsing and have downloaded the other manuals on your site.   I’m a fast reader so I can complete these fairly quickly -  its great that this material is very readable, despite its age.\r\n\r\nI grew up as a catholic until I was about 10, but I am now an atheist.  I have not studied other philosophies, however I do firmly believe in self reliance, Ayn Rand style.  (with that said, I do recognize the importance of balance, something Ayn Rand wasn’t very good at!).  I suspect the message of individualism is quite compatible with stoicism.\r\n\r\nI do not consider myself a stoic since I am quite new to this philosophy.  I am open to becoming a Stoic, and I recognize there is a difference between learning the ideas and internalizing them and making them part of your identity.   I would not be comfortable making this decision with a religion however since Stoicism is reason based I see it as an option.\r\n\r\nOut of this course I hope to gain better control of my brain, particularly on the emotional part.  I’ve been depressed since my father died a year ago and I’ve not been productive as I should be.\r\n\r\nOne of the things I was impressed by my father, was that he was able to work through difficult situations without real problems.  Psychologically he was able to tune out difficult things.  Now looking back on it, I think he must have unconsciously learned some of the ideas of stoicism himself.  He never studied this kind of material but it was clear how he was able to tune out problems and focused on getting done what was needed.  The most severe example of this was when he was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer at age 63 (and in otherwise perfect health, expecting to live until his late 80’s as his father did).  Psychologically this stage destroys a lot of people, since you have a life expectancy of 12 months or less.  He made it to 13 months and was mentally very strong for most of that time. \r\n\r\nI can be a very strong person however I do get knocked around by different things more than they should.  I’m also a little uncomfortable with modern “therapy” as I feel a lot of it is dogma, tied into keeping us fitting into the current political system, something I’m not really in agreement with.  Meditations from Marcus Aurelius is clearly from a different system and a different time and has a powerful message to share.  If this is successful I would certainly consider bringing stoicism to my broader business network.\r\n\r\nI have time at the moment to work through a Stoicism course and can fairly quickly finish working through the reading so if there is availability to start now I would like to do so.  I certainly have the need for it in my life right now.\r\n\r\nThanks for reading and I hope you can consider my application.\r\n\r\nAdrian', 1, '', 0, 0, 0, '', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', 1, 0, '', ''),

There I grew up solidly middle class. My parents, having been born at the tail end of the depression, weren’t exactly indulgent but neither were they stingy. I had the great luck to never have to experience any serious lack regarding the necessities of life. \r\n\r\nGrowing up in the decades of the 1970’s and 80’s, when the narcissism revolution was gathering momentum, by parents thus influenced by the shortage mentality of the depression, was a study in contrasts. There was a strong tendency at home towards thriftiness despite being basically economically secure. An expectation of character and virtue despite the anything goes hedonism of the surrounding culture (a moral disintegration which no one in my family was ultimately entirely immune from). A circumspection in personal behavior chaotically mixed with an often self-consciously radical and utopian political and social viewpoint. These contrasts and confusions have followed me throughout my life.\r\n\r\nMy father worked throughout his life as an Adman on Madison Avenue. Later he also taught advertising at the University level as well. Born in a working poor neighborhood in Yonkers, NY and raised by a single mother, he had struggled against his upbringing to find his way to college and a professional career. He was and is an intellectually curious man, who tends to question nearly everything. In so doing, he developed what might be seen as an “Adman’s Philosophy”. Though he was probably unaware of the historically precedents involved, his was a outlook became uncannily close to that of the ancient Sophists. \r\n\r\nHe believed “everything is interpretation” similar to the relativism of Protagoras. As well as the centrality of rhetoric a la Gorgias. The later borne out by his skillful --and not always straightforward-- use of words. He increasingly explicated these views via a curious blend of neuroscience, Zen Buddhism, Existentialism, Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs and quantum physics that seemed to be “leading edge” of human thought. A moment of clarity in this regard was found when attending EST seminars in the early 1980’s. He even taught this Adman’s philosophy for many years as an adjunct professor at Syracuse University. In this he hasn’t lacked for disciples.\r\n\r\nPerhaps it was simply my own teenage rebelliousness, but I was never much convinced by his views. In our own miniature version of this eternal debate of Western Civilization, I took the side of Socrates, Plato and Aristotle against his take on the Sophists. As I would eventually come to see it: if “everything is (merely) interpretation” i.e. nonobjective and fully perspectival, than so is that statement itself. It is an absolute statement that denies all absolutes. It fails the test of self-reference. (This could, of course, be said for all relativist statements). Despite this fundamental philosophical disagreement I have learned from my father to be unafraid to ask the tough questions. Despite his putative relativism, he always required me to give a reasoned account for me views. He refused to allow me to simply make unsupported assertions and he always challenged me. For this I am truly grateful.\r\n\r\nMy mother, on the other hand, was a journalist and writer. She has always been the more intellectually cautious of my parents. Far more concerned with being “correct” than in taking risks. But her journalist’s propensity to seek out the many sides of a story has also been a great influence in my manner of thinking. In contrast to my father’s sometimes wild leaps of intuition  (aka “fallacies”) my mother’s more patient research was seen as a necessary corrective. Though ultimately uniting the two--intuition and patient research--has been my goal.\r\n\r\nThese differences in approaches were not, sad as it is to say, the only differences between my parents. Though my siblings and I lived a life of basic economic security there was frequent and sometimes disturbing conflict between my parents. This could be entirely disruptive. The traditional social norms of marriage and family were coming undone. \r\n\r\nI don’t think either of them were happy with the expectations and limits of middle class married life in the suburbs. At the risk of oversimplifying, neither wanted to be held to the roles expected of them, while simultaneously wanting to keep the other to these very same roles. Whatever the dynamic, it was a very confusing situation to grow up in. They eventually divorced after over 30 years of marriage. Though by the end, the divorce was merely a formality, as the marriage had ended long before that.\r\n\r\nI didn’t much enjoy school. It seemed to be an extension of the very same contradictions I found at home. The same intersection between blind traditionalism and an often thoughtless radicalism (when the old guard of teachers were nearing the end of their career, and the ‘60’s radicals were in the midst of theirs). Though I have always had a good memory I had very little interest in simply regurgitating facts. I wanted to know why learning mattered. A not atypical concern for an adolescent, particularly a boy. Add to that the often brutal social conformity (ironically a conformity to the ideal of “rebellion”) and I was glad to finally graduate and get out of town. \r\n\r\nThough happily this dislike for school is not the entire story of my development. In the summer before my senior year in High School I had an intellectual epiphany of sorts. It became clear to me that learning was indicative of my very nature as a human being. Perhaps even more surprising to me was exactly how much I enjoyed the process of learning itself. This was my first clue as to what it truly meant to be a complete human being.\r\n\r\nWhile previously evidencing only a mild interest in reading, I soon became voracious. The scope of my interests widened in ways I could not have previously imagined. Most tellingly, I found a beginner’s edition of Aristotle amongst the bookshelves at home. I even began to keep it with me virtually wherever I went.  Aristotle, to the degree I even could understand him, was nothing short of revelatory: the mind can know truth (and beauty! and goodness!!).\r\n\r\nPreviously the only subject that had really interested me was music, and this interest continued. In what seemed to me to be a chaotic and emotionally unstable home and school life, music literally and figuratively provided me with harmony. I very quickly saw music not merely as the arrangement of vibrations in time, but more essentially as a discipline of inner transformation towards Truth and Beauty. \r\n\r\nWithout knowing it, I became a Platonist of sorts (when I eventually learned about the Overtone Series in college, this only increase my implicit Platonism). It became clear to me, at least as I experienced it, that music was an ordered and harmonious microcosm of a world that while not distinct from the physical world, appeared to also transcend it. Perhaps somewhat naively, it seemed clear that music was Philosophy. Through music, life made sense. Outside of music...well, not so much. Having been around numerous musicians throughout my life, I realize this is not an uncommon experience. Nevertheless, it was a powerful one.\r\n\r\nSo given my father’s influence in the adventure of ideas; my mother’s patience in research; and my musical and intellectual epiphanies, around the age of 17 or 18 I became something of a novice philosopher.\r\n\r\nUpon arriving at college I did try to follow up on this incipient interest in philosophy by taking a few courses in the subject. Regrettably, this didn’t seem to resonate very much with me. Indeed some of these courses were more interesting than others. Yet the classes themselves seemed to be more about information gathering and scholarship than about the wisdom of how to live one’s life. As odd as it might sound to some, music presented itself to me as more directly concerned with the actual “love of wisdom” than did the study of philosophy. So I majored in music.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, through these introductory courses in Philosophy I had become aware of the Stoics, though I never really delved much into the particulars of this philosophy itself. Having begun to read Plato at this time--and became immediately inspired by the personage of Socrates. I do believe I became acquainted with a certain, shall we say, “proto-Stoic” view of life. Ever since then, Socrates’ example has been something I have tried, and have often failed, to take quite seriously as a model of human excellence and a life well lived. Still, until recently my knowledge of the Stoics did not extend much further than that.\r\n\r\nEarlier this year I watched a series of video lectures by Luke Timothy Johnson entitled, “Practical Philosophy: The Greco-Roman Moralists” (via the Great Courses). This course included lectures on Seneca, Musonius Rufus, Epictetus and Marcus Aurelius, amongst others. Stoic thought immediately resonated with me. Many years ago I had read Pierre Hadot’s “What is Ancient Philosophy?” and was prompted to dust it off and read it again. It made more sense to me than ever.\r\n\r\nSo I went online to Amazon and did some searches for books on Stoicism. The first one I purchased was, “The Guide to the Good Life: The Ancient Art of Stoic Joy.” by William B. Irvine.  I found this to be a very helpful guide. Both in situating the Stoics historically and theoretically, but more importantly in offering actual philosophical exercises to enact and embody the Stoic way of life. I have since begun to practice the exercises outlined in this book i.e. “negative visualization” often on my drive to work; the “remembrance of death” on breaks at work or on the weekends at home; and have found the “trichotomy of control” to be decisive way to think about, and hopefully eliminate, self-created, and therefore unnecessary, suffering. In a very short time, these exercises have shown themselves to be of great help and practical use. It is clear to me now that these exercises could be equally helpful to others as well.\r\n\r\nTo further my understanding, I have also been reading maxims and excerpts from The Stoic Bible. I do so both right before going to sleep and upon awakening. I have found these excerpts helpful in beginning to grasp the essentials of Stoicism and as a philosophical a way of life. Epictetus, in particular, has been magnificently illuminating.\r\n\r\nConcerning the question of God, if I were to call myself anything, I would probably describe myself as a non-dogmatic panentheist. My first interest in a “spiritual” view was prompted by a reading of the Tao Te Ching in my mid- to late twenties (and many readings since). This book has had a powerful influence on me. Later, I expanded my understanding of Taoism through reading the Chuangzi (good, clean fun!). \r\n\r\nFrom there I moved on to attempts to understand the Neoplatonism of Plotinus and Meister Eckhart. Though I am drawn to both of these great thinkers, my understanding of their mystical take on philosophy remains somewhat opaque. Though that may simply be the nature of the topic itself.  Though honestly, I would doubt my own ability to understand before anything else.\r\n\r\nPerhaps, this description (found on Wikipedia), by Zen Master Soyen Shaku gets at what I take to be Ultimate Reality:\r\n\r\n“At the outset, let me state that Buddhism is not atheistic as the term is ordinarily understood. It has certainly a God, the highest reality and truth, through which and in which this universe exists. However, the followers of Buddhism usually avoid the term God, for it savors so much of Christianity, whose spirit is not always exactly in accord with the Buddhist interpretation of religious experience. Again, Buddhism is not pantheistic in the sense that it identifies the universe with God. On the other hand, the Buddhist God is absolute and transcendent; this world, being merely its manifestation, is necessarily fragmental and imperfect. To define more exactly the Buddhist notion of the highest being, it may be convenient to borrow the term very happily coined by a modern German scholar, "panentheism," according to which God is πᾶν καὶ ἕν (all and one) and more than the totality of existence.”\r\n\r\nThough I largely agree with what is said here, I do not limit myself only to this Buddhist understanding. As an aside, regardless of whether this panentheism is an accurate account of Reality or not, a “natural law” of human flourishing still exists. Which is to say that a Stoic view of anthropology and ethics is not fully constrained by one’s view on metaphysics. Though certainly it is our nature to seek the integration of these various realms of inquiry and understanding. Our human nature may or may not be an eternal archetype a la Plato. At the very least, it is an evolutionarily enduring one. In the end I don’t see that Plotinus and Darwin are at odds. As the truths of Darwin does not necessarily negate the Truth of Plotinus. The point remains though: one can have the same fully realized natural/virtue ethical position regardless of whether there is a God or not.  But be that as it may.\r\n\r\nEventually, realizing that a quasi-scholarly understanding of life was insufficient, I began to practice Zen Buddhism in my early thirties. I did so for about 2 years. At the same time I also began the practice of the martial art of Aikido. This I did for about 7 years, eventually achieving the rank of second degree black belt. Both these practices have been very helpful in my understanding of myself and the world at large. I still practice a form of qigong from time to time.\r\n\r\nYet, I ultimately found myself dissatisfied with these practices and my “Eastern turn” in general. Given my intellectual nature, the anti-intellectualism of both Zen and Aikido left much to be desired. Even more troubling was that I found both practices to be infected with a kind of utopian postmodern relativism masquerading as enlightenment (I would guess that this “infection” happened once these practices arrived in the postmodern West). Whatever promise they had held out to me as a way of life quickly disintegrated. Still, there seems to be a good deal of overlap between these practices and Stoicism. My involvement in Zen and Aikido was not in vain.\r\n\r\nThere wasn’t much emphasis on religion in my childhood. I grew up in a “post-Christian” household. Both of my parents were raised Christian, but were no longer actively so. My father was raised Catholic and my mother, Methodist. My father, in particular, to the degree he even mentioned it, would sometimes mock religion. Though both went on to embrace secular and ofttimes “radical” worldviews they retained a large degree of the Christian worldview particularly in regards to ethics, each in their own way. Though I am not sure either would describe it in exactly that sense. \r\n\r\nDespite this post-Christian upbringing I do find much to my liking about Christianity, especially Catholicism. In fact, I can usually find a more empathetic understanding of ancient philosophy amongst Christians than I can amongst the so-called educated, postmodern sophisticates. Obviously Christianity took up a lot from philosophy particularly through the Platonism of Augustine and the Aristotelianism of Aquinas. Christianity, at least in good measure, is truly “ancient thought baptized.” Whatever else it may or may not be, Christianity is in fact an integral way of life. It has much to recommend it in that sense.\r\n\r\nI have even been through a local RCIA program. The orthodox Catholics I have met have often been better philosophers than most philosophers. I have had some truly sympathetic conversations with believing Christians (of various denominations, not just Catholic). Though finally, I found I could not make the leap of faith required to become Christian. I do admire the more philosophical parts of the religion, but found that the faith in “redemptive history” was to me far more myth than logos. In short, my reason, for good or ill, “held me back”.\r\n\r\nAfter which, I felt a great letdown. For some time afterwards, I was haunted by Dostoevsky’s famous saying, “If there is no God or afterlife, than everything is permitted.” Followed by Nietzsche’s more emphatic echo, “Nothing is true, everything is permitted.” I felt I was not only looking into the abyss--to quote Nietzsche again---but the abyss was looking into me. Thus haunted, I began to look for another way beyond nihilism.\r\n\r\nI have studied philosophies other than Stoicism. First and foremost, I have been long engaged with the Platonic dialogues. I have even listened to them in a recorded, dramatized form, which has been a great joy to me to the degree that it has brought the philosophical path to life. I have also read a good deal about the history of philosophy. I have tried to avoid the category error of confusing the history of philosophy as a series of doctrines with philosophy as a way of life. I have not always been successful in doing so.\r\n\r\nTo that end I have enjoyed a good number of video lecture courses through the Great Courses. In addition to the course on “Practical Philosophy” mentioned above, I have viewed the following courses on philosophy:\r\n\r\nIntroduction to Greek Philosophy\r\nPhilosophy and Religion in the West\r\nNatural Law and Human Nature\r\nMasters of Greek Thought: Socrates, Plato and Aristotle\r\nPhilosophy of Mind\r\nTools of Thinking: Understanding the World through Reason and Experience\r\nReason and Faith: Philosophy in the Middle Ages\r\nPlato’s Republic\r\nGeometry\r\nAugustine’s Confessions\r\nStrategic Thinking Skills\r\nGame Theory in Life, Business and Beyond\r\nArgumentation: The Study of Effective Reasoning\r\nThe Philosophy of Religion\r\nThe Modern Intellectual Tradition\r\nThe Philosopher’s Toolkit: How to be the Most Rational Person in Any Room (sic!)\r\n\r\nI also have some courses which I have yet to view, such as:\r\n\r\nThe Great Ideas of Philosophy\r\nThe Ethics of Aristotle\r\nPhilosophy, Mathematics and the “Real World”\r\nProve it!: The Art of Mathematical Argument \r\nExistentialism and the Meaning of Life\r\nMachiavelli in Context\r\nThe Art of Public Speaking\r\nMusic and Mathematics\r\n\r\n(These courses have, if nothing else, given me a broad, yet still introductory knowledge concerning various aspects of the philosophical endeavor. My hope is to always go far deeper.)\r\n\r\n\r\nAs mentioned above, Socrates has been for me--as he has for countless others-- the hero and archetype of the philosophical life. I have attempted to take his focus on a dialectical approach as well as the elenchus, as a method central to the philosophical quest. Precisely because it is so powerful, the Socratic Method can be a dangerous one. No one will likely ever have to literally drink hemlock for engaging in it. But it can still be a poison of sorts for those interlocutors who would prefer not to have their pieties challenged, or have their cherished views pointed out to be incoherent. Perhaps ironically, those preaching postmodern “tolerance” like it least of all, and the supposedly close minded Christians are far more open to it. Being a gadfly, however well intentioned, comes at a cost.\r\n\r\nPerhaps even more essential than his method was how Socrates lived his life. His dedication to Beauty, Goodness and Truth; his simplicity of life; his focus, often to the point of trance, on the various questions on human existence. All of this makes him a great exemplar on how to be fully human. Though at Socrates level of attainment I would imagine that method and way of life become one.\r\n\r\nIn contrast, we now live in confused and frequently debased times. Perhaps it has always been thus. Still, in many ways our cure for this confusion is often worse than the disease. It may even be that our cure is the disease. As George Orwell once said, “the joke is not to degrade the human being, but to remind him that he is already degraded.” In that sense, the joke has been on all of us. \r\n\r\nPsychotherapy, as one example, seems more about inculcating helplessness and seeing oneself as a victim. Rather than as an instigation to healing, resilience and vitality. How this could be so amongst the most privileged human beings to ever live is an paradox best left for another day. Similarly, those who hold utopian political views appear to grow more bitter and disgruntled, even as they are more able to instantiate their wishes. Or is it because they are able to enact these wishes? Either way it seems whatever one might attain politically it is never enough. An insight which expands into another, more curious one: often the better we have it, the more miserable we become.\r\n\r\nWithin the unstable context of our current social and political reality I believe that philosophy in general, and Stoicism in particular, have much to offer. I hope that further study of Stoic philosophy continues to bear out this promise. Regardless, I would not truly consider myself to be a Stoic. At least not yet. I have too much yet to learn to label myself as such. What I hope to find by studying at the The College of Stoic Philosophers is first to obtain a better grasp of the basic theory of Stoicism. More importantly though, is to learn to practice Stoicism. \r\n\r\nMy intention to do so is not only for my own benefit but also to be better able to clearly and compellingly present Stoicism (and philosophy as a way of life) to others. Ideally, this might help in some small way to rehabilitate the notion that only the virtuous man is happy. As our commitment to “enlightened hedonism” is only making us increasingly unhappy. But if for nothing else I would like to learn how to better engage my fellow citizens and friends in the philosophical dialectic. Regardless of whether such conversations end in understanding or in perplexity, we can only benefit from the philosophical and therefore fully examined life. Truly a life well lived.\r\n\r\nGnōthi Seauton.\r\n\r\nThank you for your consideration.', 1, '', 0, 0, 0, '', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', 1, 0, '', '');

I\'m the youngest son of seven kids from an Italian American family here in New York city. no, no I\'m not from Brooklyn or the Bronx. My family lived in Astoria Queens while I grew up. Astoria was a very Greek neighborhood.  As such I\'ve been familiar with stoicism or I should say I\'ve always known who the major Greek and Roman philosophers where including Marcus Aurelius for what seems like most of my life. although as a teen I rebelled against those influences and intentionally avoided learning more. At the same time there has never been a time in my life when I wasn\'t interested in history. you know, as a kid Visigoths and Huns seemed far more interesting then the same old greeco-roman stuff my relatives and neighbors were into. At this point I would like to say that I had an interesting relationship with my dad. he never got over the dodgers or the giants leaving NY so we never watch baseball like all my friends did with their pops. In fact as a kid me and my brothers weren\'t even allowed to talk about baseball. no one ever told us not to but the subject seemed to be taboo.  I had never known why that was until my mom told us after he died. She said it broke his heart. \r\n\r\nSo we watched old westerns like highnoon or bonanza, where I think I got a lot of my morality from as an adult. Not the shoot from your hip stuff, but, do the right thing regardless of consequences such as standing up for the little guy. Which is probably why I\'m a volly EMT now. at the same time my granddad filled my childish head with stories about knights and king arthur and myths of chivalry. he claimed we where descendants from Norman knights that conquered southern Italy and Sicily in the early middle ages. As an adult I realize that granddad most likely was full of it and telling a lot of lies. I choose to believe them. He was an other one who drilled it into my head that it is important to defend and or help those in need.  Dad was the kind of guy who, if you where at our house at dinner time not only would he expect you to eat with us, if there wasn\'t enough to go around he would take food of his own plate to give to you. Unfortunately I\'m like that too and tend to get myself into trouble all the time.  Mom on the other hand was extremely greedy.  \r\n\r\nI\'ve always been kind of into philosophy but never realized it. My love of history and mythology lead me to Carl Young and Jared Diamond and of course Joseph Campbell (hero with a thousand faces is astounding) as well as hundreds of others. You can\'t really read about the migration era with out eventually reading roman or near roman sources such as Tacitus or Bede. Which of course eventually leads you to Marcus. \r\n\r\nI grew up catholic but I\'m more of a cultural catholic then practicing. As to religion I\'m not really sure where I stand on it. I don\'t really believe, considering myself an atheist or at best an agnostic, but at the same time public religious ceremonies have never bothered me. after all we are mostly a Christian country it is part of our cultural history. seems silly to ignore or try to remove that aspect. my only problem is when one tries to force their beliefs on others. including hard core atheist.  Now that is not to say that religion doesn\'t bring any thing to the table. as it dose. there is a lot of wisdom in most religious texts and or beliefs. You also need to beware, when taken to far it can lead to problems. \r\n\r\nwith in the last year, I came across you\'re web site. after reading about stoicism I had an epiphany. a lot of it I already believed in with out expressing it so well, other parts I learned the hard way over a life time of experience. such as accepting things and or people for what and who they are rather then trying to force them into your idea of what they should be. there are parts I like and would like to learn more about but am also a little apprehensive to. I\'ve been reading the reddit forum on stoicism and feel that more then a few of the members have a religious zeal of a monotheist fundamentalist nature and go to far. such as a scorched earth policy with the eradication of humor and emotion. both I feel are important parts of life. of which I also feel that to much of either is just as bad as too little. as a life with out passion is not worth living but a life ruled by passion is a mess, a string of tragedies one after an other. \r\n\r\nwhich brings me to why I am here.  to say that I share a common trait that is know to afflict people of my ancestry. To say the least I\'m a hot blooded, overly passionate, emotional NY ginny.  I think studying stoicism can teach how to reach a balance my life needs.  what was the quote from Buddha, a musical instruments string wound to tight breaks and one not tight enough will not play. \r\n\r\nI\'m currently working at an insane taxi company. with a crazy boss who fires and rehires you on a hourly basis and coworkers who are incompetent at best. on weekends twice a month I\'m a volunteer emt.

My current employment is that of a Liquor Licensing Inspector and Enforcement Officer in local government but my story begins in Sheffield England.\r\n\r\nI was born in 1968, growing up in a small satellite town to Sheffield, which is a large industrial city with a population of about seven hundred thousand people.  My father was an engineer and my mother a nurse and had lived all their working life “in the valley” as it was known.  As I grew up and left school, a similar future to my parents frightened me.  I wanted to see the world, not work day in and day out in the valley.\r\n\r\nAt the age of eighteen I joined the Royal Navy, more specifically, the Submarine Branch.  I served during  the last two years of the Cold War and as a consequence experienced what it was like to play cat and mouse with Soviet submarines under the ice and off the coast of Northern Russia, albeit in my capacity as a mechanic.  I lived alongside a functioning nuclear reactor in a long narrow steel tube along with a hundred or so other souls.  I can describe the life of a submariner in the broadest terms as being long periods of excruciating boredom, punctuated with very short episodes of potentially life threatening situations.  I served for nine years in the Senior Service as a mechanic on submarines and as a Diver.\r\n\r\nIn 1996 I met my now wife.  I left the Royal Navy and we subsequently moved to New Zealand and married.  Once settled in New Zealand, I worked as a commercial diver for two years before joining the NZ Police Service.\r\n\r\nWe moved to Christchurch, one of the largest cities in New Zealand with a population of over four hundred thousand people.  I worked as a General Duties Constable as a first responder, attending all manner of jobs ranging from giving directions to tourists to attending homicides.\r\n\r\nAfter seven years in General Duties I sat several professional exams and over a period of three years trained to become a Detective in the Criminal Investigation Branch.  I served a further seven years in the police as a Detective, working predominantly on serious crime.  \r\n\r\nI attended serious crime scenes and took charge of the examination of the scene, analysis of evidence, developing investigation strategies, interviewing victims, witnesses and offenders, arresting offenders, preparing matters for prosecution in the High Court and then running subsequent trials with the assistance of the Crown Prosecutor.\r\n\r\nI specialized in several other areas including crisis negotiation, particularly in hostage and incidents involving suicidal subjects.  I deployed with the Armed Offenders Squad on many occasions and took the role of primary negotiator on many live negotiations.\r\n\r\nI also specialized in the field of running criminal informants, and controlling under cover agents – a role that used to be known as Handler.  These roles required an ability to think on the run, reacting to situations as they occurred, far more challenging than the considered decisions made as a Detective in day-to-day work.  Many of these decisions required a quick assessment of factors before choosing an appropriate course of action.  Decisions were often layered with sequential outcomes desired toward an ultimate goal.\r\n\r\nDuring my police career I saw the many guises of death, and had to deal with many bodies in a variety of states.  Some in advanced states of decay, others dismembered or decapitated and many dead children.  As part of my roles in a number of homicide enquiries I attended several autopsies.  These scenes I am able to see in my head when I choose, but they do not intrude or affect my daily life.  I have considered these challenging situations and rationalized them both whilst submerged in the experience at the time, and subsequent to the experiences when my mind turns to them.\r\n\r\nI have had to face my own mortality on a number of occasions, for example whilst apprehending dangerous offenders or having had firearms pointed at my head.  All these experiences have required the ability to control how these external factors affect my thinking and how I function as a human being.\r\n\r\nOn one occasion I had a firearm pointed at my face at very close range, through a glass door by an offender.  I was unarmed at the time and was immediately challenged to do something.  I very quickly settled myself, thought if he pulls the trigger it is beyond my control anyway, calmly turned and walked away.  Once at the end of the driveway to the property where this occurred, I radioed for assistance and maintained observations on the property.  The offender was subsequently arrested and taken into custody by the Armed Offender Squad.\r\n\r\n Without being aware of it, I have been a stoic for most of my working life.  I have examined situations and thought about how I should think and behave in relation to these situations.  I have enjoyed situations of controlled risk and when the risk has gone beyond my control, I have considered the factors and taken the appropriate action.\r\n\r\nMore recently, I have left the police to pursue a career in local government as a Health Inspector.  It is during this time that I developed an interest in philosophy and psychology, reading a wide variety of books ranging from The Republic by Plato to The Righteous Mind by Jonathan Haidt.\r\n\r\nOne of the most recent books I read was Philosophy for Life and other Dangerous Situations by Jules Evans.  I thought the connection between ancient stoic philosophy and modern cognitive behavioral therapy was fascinating.  I have sought to find out more information since reading the book about stoicism, of which this essay is a part.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion I respectfully request that I be considered for acceptance into the college to further my rather limited academic knowledge of stoicism, given my comparatively extensive practical knowledge in stoic thought.\r\n\r\n\r\nPaul Cooper\r\nTimaru\r\nNew Zealand', 1, '', 0, 0, 0, '', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', 1, 0, '', ''),

I eventually would like to speak publicly about Stoicism and it\'s practicality.\r\n\r\nI was born in Summit, New Jersey. My mom, Mary, grew up in Manhasset, Long Island, and my dad, David, grew up in York, Pennsylvania. I am from a family with five kids, I was born second, and I have two brothers and two sisters. I went to public school until seventh grade, when I went to an all boys high school, Delbarton School.  I went to Duke University, and graduated in May 2012. Once I graduated, I moved to Chicago, IL, where I have worked for the last year and eight months as an equity options trader at Peak6 Investments. \r\n\r\nI have always been into reading, but over my years at college I partied a lot and had less time for my books. Over the course of the last year, I have spent a good deal of it reading and refocusing on my hobby of studying practical philosophy. My job gives me a decent amount of free time, my social life has calmed down, and I have spent much of my time working through a lot of the classics.\r\n\r\nI figure the best way to show what Stoicism means to me is to show my progression towards it through my book choices.  I first started reading again about a year ago, six months after beginning my job.  My first exposure to Stoicism was Seneca\'s "On the Shortness of Life" in the Penguin Great Ideas series. I ordered a bunch of these little books for  a quick introduction to some of our great thinkers.  The selections of Seneca were short, but it gave me a good introduction to Stoicism, and I could sense the practicality of the material.  It was different from anything I had ever read. I probably liked Seneca\'s book the most out of all the short books in that little collection. I started to get more into reading as a way of getting another look at both the world I live in, and at my job, which is fairly stressful. \r\n\r\nNext I read the autobiography of Franklin and biographies of Lincoln, and Warren Buffet, and I tried to study traits of these men that made them stand out.  I soon moved towards Thoreau, because I enjoyed his selections in The Penguin Great Ideas series. Few books have entertained me as much as Walden did when I first read it.  After Thoreau, I moved to Emerson, who is now without question my favorite writer. "Self-Reliance" is an incredible essay. I ran through all of his other essays, and have devoted a lot of time in the last year to all of his works.  \r\n\r\nSoon after first reading Emerson I decided to compile my favorite passages from passages I had read into a book.  I included passages from the great philosophers and writers that I thought could serve as a guide for my life and career.  When making this book I included passages from books I enjoyed, which included Aristotle\'s Ethics, Chesterfield\'s "Letters",  Marcus Aurelius\' "Meditations" (Stoic!), Seneca\'s letters (Another!), Thoreau, and many others.  There are almost a hundred passages in that book from many different sources, and I plan on eventually editing it and updating it further.\r\n\r\nI saw how much respect the Transcedentalists had for Eastern classics, so I then got into the Bhagadavad Gita, the Dhammapada, the Tao te Ching, the Rubaiyyat, some Persian Poetry.  I also read some of the Bible, particularly Ecclesiastes, after learning that excerpts from this book were on the ceiling in Montaigne\'s study.  I still like returning to these texts often. Around this time I read Siddhartha by Herman Hesse, and really enjoyed that book, and read some Alan Watts.\r\n\r\nAfter these enlightening books I took a 180 degree turn and read Nietzsche, as I had often heard of Nietszche but never got around to reading him. I started with reading his aphorisms in "Human All too Human."  I eventually read all of his major works though "Thus Spake Zarathustra" is still very difficult. I read Nietszche praise Thucydides, Machiavelli, and Horace, so I read some of these three but I have not gotten around to reading them as completely as I would like.   I also read Schopenhauer and Freud\'s "Civilization and it\'s Discontents".  After Nietzsche I got an Ayn Rand reader, and read a condensed version of her major works and liked the "Anthem".  \r\n\r\nDuring this time, I was also getting more involved in Stoicism. I had ordered "The Stoic and Epicurean Philosophers" online and got my first exposure to Epictetus. I loved the practicality of his message, and read his handbook and discourses. I then ordered Senecas\'s Complete Moral letters and also selected Dialogues and Essays. I read all the letters and still have work to do on the dialogues and essays. I ordered the complete essays of Montaigne and I am still working on them, I have the third volume to finish. After reading of Emerson and Montaigne\'s respect for Plutarch, I ordered a selection of his Morals, and I\'m starting to cover his "Lives". I would like to read all of the lives by the summer. I also recently bought Arrian\'s biography of Alexander the Great, which I am looking forward to.\r\n\r\nOne other Stoic-inspired introduction I remember I really enjoyed was Burton\'s introduction to "Anatomy of Melancholy".  \r\n\r\nSo I hope that progression gives a background to what lead me to my appreciation for Stoicism.  After exploring a lot of practical philosophy, I now want to follow Seneca\'s advice and hone in on a few authors, rather than study many different ones.   My main writers that I love and will constantly return to are Montaigne, Seneca, Epictetus, Plutarch, and Emerson.  I would like to try to further my studies in Stoicism through the College of Stoic Philosophers.  Stoicism has already started to shape the way I think about things.  Being a stoic seems to be an ideal, which may be out of reach, but it is worth it to strive towards that ideal.  I have already seen the rewards of that endeavor in my life and with my job, and I look forward to continuing it.', 1, '', 0, 0, 0, '', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', 1, 0, '', ''),

I am the product of young parents, both of whom still work. My father is a truck driver and my mother works in a local museum. I have one younger brother. My upbringing and childhood was typical of that of a working class family in the 80s and 90s, with its relative freedom, limitations but also opportunities for social mobility provided by the state education system at the time. I studied Law at King\'s College at the University of London and in the boom of the early 2000s found my way into finance, initially in London and now for the past 10 years in Hong Kong. I have been married to my wife Vivien for close to 8 years and have 3 boys between the ages of 1 and 7. In addition we have 3 dogs.\r\nMy spiritual and intellectual journey has taken me from atheism and agnosticism whilst growing up, to a short spell as a Christian and eventually to Stoicism and a classical pantheistic view of the universe. The philosopher John Gray once wrote that just as Freud saw sex as informing all behaviour, he saw religion in the same way, a statement with which I agree. Humans are intrinsically spiritual and religious creatures and life is incredibly strange. Coming to terms with this aspect of my own nature and developing it in a mature and informed way is perhaps the great project of life and an indispensible part of becoming a full human being. \r\nAs a child I atteneded a Church of England Primary school for six years. However, my parents were secular and religion only played a role in my development in so far as it was something to rebel against. The soft liberal Anglicanism of school life was bewildering to me, floating unconnected with the real world. At the age of 9 I declared myself an atheist and refused to pray in school assemblies. I remained so through my teens and early 20s. My atheism was entirely an intellectual move. I saw no evidence for God, at least the Christian God. Religion looked like an archaic foible left over from less informed ages with little role to play in the late 20th and 21st centuries. \r\nYet deep down I yearned, and yearning was a force which became more powerful as I entered the world of work and the senselessness of sitting at a desk 12 hours a day for 48 weeks a year. My twenties were also characterized by several episodes of moderate to severe depression, starting at university and continuing through until I left London 10 years later. I drank heavily and became increasingly reckless, resulting in one violent assault against me by 3 other men late one night outside my house. The soul searching led me back into church life. I took the Alpha Course in 2003 and declared myself a Christian shortly thereafter, a position I held for about six years. Christianity satisfied a need for meaning and for community. It ordered and structured my daily life, gave me a ground for my morality and put me in touch with a spiritual side to my self which had previously been ignored. I enjoyed praying and reading the Bible, and loved thinking about religious problems and theology. As well as being a deep source of belonging however, Christianity was also a deep source of anxiety. I could see that the narrative was just not true. In particular the grand narrative that man was a fallen creature was untenable when compared to the best evidence which described our path from the bottom of the ocean to African hunter gatherers to today\'s technological age. I also struggled with the concept of "knowing God". God\'s defining characteristic, it seemed to me, was a kind of absence which left the soul hanging unfulfilled. No matter where I searched I could not make contact in a deep and knowing way with this thing called God.\r\nWhen I came to Hong Kong I eventually left the church. My girlfriend and later wife was not a Christian. It was initially a relief and I enjoyed having my intellectual freedom back. I read widely in evolutionary biology and explored other religions such as Buddhism. Yet the yearning never left, and my depression from time to time would return with force. I stumbled across Stoicism in 2014 and found the College of Stoic Philosophers shortly after, completing the SES and MA courses. What was initially a "mind hack" to try to control my anxiety and depression quickly became an \r\nalternative spiritual well from which to draw water. I was more at home with the rational, natural theology of Stoicism than that of Christianity and appreciated the undogmatic nature of its view of the grand questions of life and the humility to admit our lack of certainty and potential for error. The mix of pre-socratic mysticism, the concept of the logos, and the later Roman integration of the life of reason and religion works for me. It received reinforcement from many modern writers as diverse as Rupert Sheldrake and Galen Strawson. The works of Pierre Hadot were also indispensible in my development as a Stoic philosopher, particularly "Philosophy as a Way of Life" and the role of ancient spiritual practices. \r\nStoicism did not however cure my depression, and in 2017 I was diagnosed with Type II bipolar disorder, a mental illness in which the sufferer experiences both the lows of depression but also the highs of mania. As a diagnosis it made sense of much of my life as a teen and adult. I was unable to control it with the anti-psychotic and anti-seizure medicine available and went through a number of presciptions which all ultimately made the problem worse. I still consider myself lucky not to have commited suicide, and only the support of my wife and the knowledge that I needed to take care of my children kept me alive. I eventually found a path to stability through the ketogenic diet and fasting, which whilst not a cure has worked quite well for two years. Whilst bipolar can be a source of nightmares and for periods of time totally ruin life, it also has a connection with spiritual or even mystical experiences. In my 20s I had experienced mild halucinations but had never taken these seriously. In my late 30s I eventually started to feel that deep connection with "God", whatever that might be, for which I had so yearned as a Christian. At times it felt as if I could see beneath the veil of images and experience directly what lay beyond, and I would become one with it, merging and losing a sense of self. I knew God was present and all was well, and that the universe was one total thing into which I was woven like a thread. At other times I would experience music so intensely it was as if I was actually in the music in the same way one can be caught in a rainstorm. I also had experiences where I felt for certain two of my deceased grandparents were simply there with me. I have learned to take these experiences more seriously as a genuine and valuable component of my life, and the quest to make sense of them is a motivating factor in joining the Fourth School. \r\nAnd so I arrive at 40, somewhat beaten up and unsure but also very happy with what nature has seen fit to grant me, in particular my family. Life is strange. I don\'t really know what I am or why I am here, or what on earth the universe might be. I watch people arrive at work and do the shopping and lust after houses and cars and don\'t get it. The whole show is so short and odd that I don\'t have time to waste making a fetish of medium sized consumer goods (though my wife is better at that!). My beliefs are well thought through but open to challenge. I am comfortable with the big picture as presented by the Stoics, whilst not feeling a need to obsess over the correctness of the details of their thought. I am a pantheist and a panpsychist. Nature and God are one and the same and consciousness permeates all. God is both consciousness itself and intelligent ordering. We have access to experiencing that God through various practices such as meditation and prayer, and through the Good Life which is in the end one and the same as the life of reason and morality. \r\nWe each have a fate to live and there is not much we can do except live it well and wait for what comes next!', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, '', 0, '', 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 'I was born and raised in the UK, spending most of my childhood in Worcester and most of my adult life in London, firstly studying at King\'s College for an LLB, and afterwards working in Finance.

During the day I work in the risk management department of a bank. \r\n\r\nI have always been interested in the use of religion and philosophy as providing shape and guidance for one\'s life, though only came into serious contact with Stoicism for the first time in 2014. Having read the Marcus Aurelius\' Meditations and Epictetus\' Handbook, I knew it was the philosophy for me. I completed the SES course, which broadened my understanding and practice of Stoic philosophy, before enrolling in the Marcus Aurelius school. To live in accordance with nature, pursuing truth and justice and accepting with gratitude what providence brings us in our life seems to me the highest way to live. \r\n\r\nMy desire for the coming years is develop as a Stoic, living in accordance with nature, and tasting the freedom and tranquility that a virtuous life promises.

I spent the first seven years of my life living with my mother, grandparents and my 3 aunts and uncles.\r\nI stopped asking about my father when before I was ten. I have not expended any further energy asking since and I have no desire to.\r\n\r\nAt the age of seven I moved in with my mother and stepfather . At the age of 14 we moved to another county, I did not take the move well at first and I spent a lot of time alone indulging my introspective nature.\r\n\r\nAround this time I was very serious with soccer and I played for my county, I was instructed to gain weight as I was considered too light.\r\nI was instructed to gain 30lbs by my coach. \r\nI was given 6 months to achieve this .\r\nI was unsuccessful at gaining this weight although I did everything I could this task was virtually impossible.\r\nThis was the first time that I had been introduced to radical personal improvement and in later years this was led to an interest in bodybuilding.\r\n\r\nAt the age of 16 I was spotted at a local game and brought for a trial at a professional club \r\nDuring this trial I was training with the under 21 team, at the end of the month I was told that I was too young and that they would bring me back next year.\r\n The deciding factor was that I ran myself into the ground on a fitness test and vomited. It wasn\'t because I wasn\'t fit enough,  I just went all out when I should have held something back. \r\nMy body didn\'t let me down my mind did.\r\n\r\nWell in the next year I trained every day after school I would say that  I probably put in 20 extra hours a week. Unfortunately the club I was scheduled to go back to went through some major upheavals of their own, all of my subsequent contacts were gone and the opportunity to go back passed. Subsequent opportunities went unrealised as I suffered a number of injuries between the ages of 17-19\r\n\r\nDuring this time my grandfather died this was especially sad as it was only weeks before I got my first trial and he would have been extremely proud. Growing up he was like a father to me and he died at the relatively young of 65.He was unconscious for one week before he died and my family and I spent the last 5 days by his bedside. It was during this time where I really applied the tenets of stoicism without even realising it. I was determined to pass through this event stronger and to be prepared if something similar ever happened again.\r\n\r\nAfter school I was uncertain of my future and decided to start working , I worked manual labour jobs and drank a lot of alcohol it was a good year but for most of this time I was on a waiting list for a hernia operation (10months wait for operation), I couldn’t stop working because I needed the money and I couldn’t tell my employers or I would lose my job. Managing my injury was difficult  ,coughing was painful and every time I sneezed I would fall to my knees in pain.\r\nIronically during this time I was probably in the best physical shape of my life as I was lifting weights almost every day , I had tailored my workouts not to aggravate my hernia.\r\n\r\nAfter my operation I decided that I wanted to go to college. This lasted three years and no one event jumps out at me., I studied accountancy and although I have an interest in numbers accountancy does not really interest me to the extent that I would spend 40 hours a week studying. I done the work I needed to do and nothing more, I passed easily with a middle of the road grade.\r\n\r\nAfter college I was woefully unprepared for the big bad world.\r\n I could not find employment and had no direction in life. I became very depressed.\r\nLuckily after 3 months I got a job offer ,but I still fear what  my mind would conjure up if I was left helpless again have a strong fear of being destitute that I need to overcome.\r\n\r\nFortunately I am no longer helpless ever since I have started working I have been constantly educating myself and I am much more resilient and confident of my abilities \r\n\r\nI am currently working at a property management company, which I find extremely unfulfilling. The industry itself is rife with lies and dishonesty in addition to that  I am currently on call constantly and I receive trivial and annoying phone calls night and day.\r\nI would estimate that 10% of the correspondence I receive is relevant not only is my time being wasted needlessly my time is being wasted needlessly at a job I don’t even care about. I have had people call me at 11pm on a Saturday night about an advertisement they can’t remember the details of, I have had people call me after hours because they do not have enough plates.\r\n\r\nI have been studying various different fields for the last two years and i have read over 100 books relating to business, psychology, sociology and I wish to use this information to create a product/service that can benefit mankind as a whole. During this time I stumbled across stoicism.\r\n\r\nI want to start my own business but I am held back by the fear of unemployment and the anxiety of breaking away from my stable job.\r\n\r\nI feel that stoicism will give me the perspective I need to push myself even when times are good. Although I have endured some hardship I do not think I have lived an especially hard life, I am person that seems to be driven by the stick rather than the carrot.9 times out of ten the carrot is more money and quite frankly there is nothing I need to buy. \r\n I have no real desire for possessions and I live a relatively simple life.\r\n I do not drink often, I don’t gamble and I have never done drugs.\r\n\r\nI have saved 30% of my salary for the last two years and my greatest expense has probably been education. I am constantly reading and taking courses to expand my knowledge.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a sense I am hard to motivate because there is nothing I want I am hoping stoicism can give me the boost I need to keep pushing forward all the time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1.

My father worked for many years as a landscape architect. My mother briefly worked at the Department of Agriculture in Washington D.C. When I was younger they encouraged me to develop my artistic skills. With the help of my parents I cultivated my creativity and drew pictures whenever I could. \r\n\r\nWhen I was three we moved to Salt Lake City where my mothers family primarily lived. I was raised Mormon but stopped participating in the faith when I was 13 years old. My parents, who divorced when I was eight, were open minded and encouraged me to explore my own ideas about the world. \r\n\r\nMy mother always encouraged me to read and always reached out to me to discuss how I felt about the world. My father was practical, thrifty, and a very technical thinker.\r\n\r\nIn high school I struggled to focus on my studies. I spent most of my class time drawing pictures and making up an elaborate fake religion with my class mates called Zia. As a child I had been diagnosed with ADHD and had been on various medications over the years. By the time I was in high school we had given up on medications. I dropped out in my second year of high school and transferred to an alternative high school. I got within 5 credits of graduating and took my GED for the final 5 credits and managed to receive my diploma. \r\n\r\nAfter high school I worked various jobs but in the back of my mind supposed that I would eventually become an artist. When I moved to Portland with friends in 1997 my hope was that a more artistic community would embrace my latent genius. My friends and I lived in a studio apartment for about six months. None of them were able to find substantial work and moved back to Salt Lake leaving me with the lease. I had met someone in Portland and moved in with them. Within a year I was able to get a job with the Multnomah County Library where I have worked for fifteen years.\r\n\r\nMy work at the library, though I’m in the lowest paid position, is something I’ve grown to consider a special calling. It’s sustained me and developed my character. I feel strongly about the roles libraries play in their communities and also that they are needed more than ever.\r\n\r\nI still draw occasionally and create artwork but look on these activities as cathartic hobbies more than anything else. My current hobby/passion is film photography. I feel that photography is a technical craft but also very direct. The camera itself doesn’t lie but you can lie to the camera. I like using film because it helps me to slow down and appreciate the whole of the process of creating the photographic image. \r\n\r\nI am currently in community college working on a Associates of Applied Science in Web Design and Development. \r\n\r\nI’ve been interested in Stoic philosophy for approximately seven years. The first thing I read was an excerpt from the Enchirideon by Epictetus in the “Portable Greek Reader”. Before reading this I had been interested in Zen Buddhism and I had a handful of books that resonated with me including “The Unfettered Mind” by Takuan Soho. In Takuan Soho I found a description of what it meant to have a clear mind. In Epictetus I found an appeal to my reason to distinguish between things I could and couldn’t control, to live according to nature, and to not waffle on my commitment to do those things. The advice struck me as very practical and immediately helped me to reevaluate a few events that were happening in my life at the time. I’ve always been an introspective person and I’ve picked on myself all my life. In the Enchirideon was a call to action that I couldn’t ignore for long. \r\n\r\nIn small degrees I’ve tried experiments in applying stoic principles to my daily life. It’s taken a very long time but I feel like there are aspects of these experiments that are developing in a positive direction. I try to “watch myself as an enemy and one in ambush.” \r\n\r\nAny books you read on Stoic philosophy. If any, please list them.\r\n\r\nThe Enchirideon by Epictetus\r\nThe Letters of Seneca\r\nA Guide to the Good Life by William B. Irvine\r\nOn Anger by Seneca\r\nOn The Shortness of Life by Seneca\r\nMusonius Rufus, Lectures and Sayings\r\n\r\nWould you call yourself an atheist, agnostic/skeptic, deist, theist?\r\n\r\nI am an agnostic with atheistic leanings. I was raised Mormon.\r\n\r\nAre you a member of a religious faith? If so, which and for how long?\r\n\r\nI don’t identify with any religious faith.\r\n\r\nHave you studied philosophies other than Stoicism? If so, which?\r\n\r\nI have read some history of philosophy and about the pre-socratic philosophers. I\'ve read some of the Platonic dialogues. I have read the Unfettered Mind by Takuan Soho multiple times as well as Zen Mind, Beginners Mind by Suzuki (these are my two favorite books on Zen and the ones I found most helpful). Assorted essays by Emmerson, Walden by Henry David Thoreau. I don’t know that these reads would count as “Study” but there you go.\r\n\r\nDo you consider yourself to be a Stoic?\r\n\r\nI am a very bad Stoic. I sometimes get angry and act irrationally, I make judgments based on external things, I allow the insults and opinions of others effect my tranquility, I presently have no fixed moral principle that I live by.\r\n\r\nWhat you want to get from this course.\r\n\r\nI would like to strategize ways to apply stoic principles in my life and I would like to be a virtuous person. In my work I have been called on to take a minor leadership role. This has been extremely challenging for me. I have tried to examine my behavior through a stoic lens.

I have worked for a civil construction company, a civil engineering consultancy and have recently started a position with a government organisation working on civil construction projects; this brings me to the present.\r\n\r\nI have been interested in Stoicism for roughly the past three years; I came across it when reading a copy a Marcus Aurelius’ Meditations. It was mentioned within the book ‘Tuesdays with Morrie’, I think while reading this I was in contemplation about much in general. A quote Ted Koppel held close to him was one of Marcus Aurelius’; I decided to read Meditations after finishing the mentioned book. After reading this I knew that stoicism was something which I found very interesting which has prompted me further pursue it, Meditations is my only encounter to stoicism I have had so far. \r\n\r\nAs part of my work I am required, as the basis, to think logically and rationally with my decisions and provide succinct answers. Now that I am in a government position a lot of what is done requires a just unbiased approach. This has been developed implicitly through tasks I have done but I have never had any formal training based solely on this line of thought. In writing that, my conclusion is that I have never understood the means to logic and rational thought along with a just approach, I have only rope-learned the important things to consider. I believe that undertaking this course will offer me further insight to these areas.\r\n\r\nI also am interested to learn more about Stoicism as it was the primary lifestyle which was present during the height of the Roman Empire, from what I have read. As the Roman Empire was at the forefront of civil development and Stoicism was born of this time I guess that I believe there is a link between the thought process and methodology of a Stoic and the great advances and development the Roman Empire brought. So I guess there is abit of romancing about stoicism to.\r\nIt is not easy to talk or explain about religious views but I will give it a go. I have been a Christian all of my life and have grown up in a Christian family and attended Christian schools and teaching ect., though not the most diligent I do believe in god and many of the Christian values. Most of this has come from living in Christian communities; I believe I have seen the practical aspect of Christianity work well which gives me confidence that it is, or can be a great tool to help people. Though I am not completely Christian, I am a theist. I am not completely sold on Christianity as a truth but I do believe as a truth, that there is a God in existence. I have a belief that all religions have a structure of values, principals and virtues, and also individuals have a structure of values and virtues. An individual practicing a religion is in some way a calibration of their values and virtues to that of the religion so that a good life is practically implemented.\r\n\r\nI believe that there is a link between Christian teachings in some ways to that of Stoicism. St. Thomas Aquinas, who developed the five truths which are important rational arguments Christianity holds for Gods existence, was a great admirer of Aristotle. His development of the four cardinal virtues for Christianity are that of Stoicism but slightly altered; prudence, temperance, justice and fortitude. He then goes on to describe the divine virtues; love, hope and faith which are given by God.\r\n\r\nI have never studied any other philosophies before and am new to the study of philosophy in general. I have been waiting until the end of my degree to apply for this course, as you are not allowed to be studying at another academic institution (along with a good time to start it). I now finally have the time and structured life to undertaken this seriously.\r\n\r\nThe things I wish to get out of this course are an improvement in my logical thinking and to possibly learn about rhetorical argument. I know that throughout the course I will find great affirmations and insightful pieces of writing, to study these getting a greater understanding of them will be very valuable. I think once I have undertaken the course I will find things which I have not sought after in the course, which will be just as valuable to me as the abovementioned points.\r\n\r\nI do not consider myself to be a stoic, I don’t think I have the knowledge yet to even classify well enough if I am one. I do wish to work on the virtues that underpin being a stoic with a faith that they may be able to offer much.\r\n\r\nTo directly address the inscription ‘know thyself’ I believe that I have a mediocre understanding of who I am, though at the same time I would also say I have a good understanding of myself…? I would say there are many sides to me but I guess the important aspect is what I end up practically doing. Truthfully I don’t think I have a good understanding of what really drives me and my behaviours. I don’t like saying that because I would rather lie to myself and feel in control, it’s much easier than telling yourself you have flaws. I feel that I am dependent on so many trivial and frivolous things, and have trouble understanding why. Ie. I don’t understand the nature of myself\r\n\r\nI do know that I want to work towards being more ethical as a person and to develop a better understanding of what my ethical stance is. So I also see this course as a personal development tool. \r\n\r\nA secondary or consequential reason I want to take this course is to improve my essay writing, in my current day to day life I am not doing this but I see it as important to continue to develop my written skills.\r\n\r\nAnother aspect which I find very interesting is the stoic present attitude or mindset of prosochē, to learn more about this practice I believe would be a great thing to implement. Many hours in a day I lax with my thoughts not really being present periodically throughout the day, the practice of prosochē I believe would improve my performance in tasks and also my self-knowledge. It almost seems like a tool to liberation of thought, to break habitual chains.\r\n\r\nMy longterm goal once I have completed this course is to undertake the year long program presented within the Marcus Aurelius School and to become a Fellow of the College of Stoic Philosophers.\r\n\r\nI have been looking forward to taking this course for a while now and am very keen to take each stage of the study seriously to get the most out of it. I look forward to your response and believe that I will make a good addition to the school.\r\n', 1, '', 0, 0, 0, '', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', 1, 0, '', ''),

While many of these books I now consider to be lacking in philosophical depth and intellectual rigor, at the time I found the works of Dan Millman, Ken Wilber and Deepak Chopra to be uplifting and helpful through the trials and troubles of teenage life.  I was raised in a Jewish household, my family practiced a liberal interpretation of the religion, know as “Reform Judaism.”  In my teen years I sought meaning in New Age and eastern belief systems, including Zen Buddhist meditations and Daoist practices.   I gravitated to the lifestyle of a “religious maverick,” freely exploring and adopting any practices that I felt would 1) bring me closer to God, and 2) be directly helpful and applicable to my daily life.\r\n\r\nI was a dedicated student of eastern martial arts from age fifteen to twenty-three, earning a black belt in Kenpo.  I have also studied traditional Chinese Wushu, Capoeira, Kendo and western fencing.  I believe that the martial arts can serve as a focal-point for life in general, meaning that they have helped me to be proactive, self-motivated and self-sufficient.    \r\n\r\nI excelled in academic life, earning high marks in High School.  I attended California Lutheran University, graduating with honors 2002 with a Bachelor of Science degree in Biology.  After my graduation, I moved on to work in marketing and business.  I have worked as a project manager for leading marketing and creative firms such as Martin Worldwide, Ciplex and Ripe Media.  \r\n\r\nIn 2005 my brother invited me to a Gnostic Mass which was presented by the Ordo Templi Orientis (O.T.O.), a school in the freemasonic mystery tradition.  I was enthralled by the practice of “spiritual initiation,” I formally joined the O.T.O. and received several initiations, as well as instruction in Hermetic Kabbalah.  Today I maintain my identity as a Jewish person, but I would consider myself a Hermeticist.  “Hermetic” meaning that I ascribe to the doctrine of “as above, so below,” meaning that we are both a) reflections of the structure of the Creator, b) connected to the Creator and c)  individual points of consciousness that posses free-will independently from the Creator.  I do believe in a superior Being that is responsible for Creation and that this Being is connected to us in ways that defy our rational understanding.\r\n\r\nMy current spiritual regiment is designed to bring me in closer relationship with God and to bring about improved health and psycho-emotional well-being.  These practices include Kundalini Yoga, Daoist QiGong and Western Hermetic/Occult practices such as devotional exercises, banishing rituals, invocations and evocations.  I am currently studying Six Healing Sounds and Iron Shirt QiGong under Dena Saxer, one of Mantak Chia\'s students.  I have derived great benefit from this practice for my physical health, however I feel that eastern studies do not meet my needs in terms of a practical philosophy for daily life.  \r\n\r\nI have been interested in Stoicism since I was first introduced to the term “Stoic philosophy” while reading Tim Ferriss\'  popular book “The Four Hour Workweek.”  In the book, Ferriss proclaims his high regard for Seneca.  Ferriss quotes Seneca directly “Set aside a certain number of days, during which you shall be content with the scantest and cheapest fare, with coarse and rough dress, saying to yourself the while: ‘Is this the condition that I so feared?”  \r\n\r\nI found “The Four Hour Workweek” to be profound and insightful, notably because of its focus on happy living and creating a consciously-designed lifestyle.  Inspired to investigate Stoic philosophy further, starting with Epictetus, I read “The Enchiridion” as well as as “Epictetus: The Essential Writings.”  Unlike other Greco-Roman philosophers, I found his writing to be clear, concise and directly applicable to the trails and tribulations of daily life.  I was elated by Epictetus, and moved on to read “Letters from a Stoic” by Seneca.      \r\n\r\nI am so moved, impressed and emotionally relieved by the power of applying Stoic philosophy to my life, that I feel that I must pursue more education in this wonderful and practical school of philosophical thought.  In answer to your question, yes – I consider myself a Stoic.  I have been made a happier person through my limited understanding of Stoicism.  When faced with a troubling event, I ask myself “Is this within my control to change?”  So many of our upsets in life would be alleviated if we simply stopped generating internal resistance to things that are beyond our power to control.  \r\n\r\nWhat I want to get out of this course, is:\r\n1. A more thorough academic understanding of Stoic philosophy, including the history and key contributors.\r\n2. An in-depth understanding of how Stoic philosophy is applied in daily life and throughout the many phases of life (youth, work, old age and death).\r\n\r\nLastly, I would like to know how to apply this one, remarkable statement made by Epictetus to my daily life: \r\n\r\n“If any [man] be unhappy, let him remember that he is unhappy by reason of himself alone.”\r\n\r\nI take from this that Epictetus believed that happiness comes purely from within, and that we should not be dependent on external things to make us feel the way we want to feel.  What has attracted me to the western philosophies is that they do not deny the rational thought-processes, as is often the case with Zen Buddhist and other eastern schools.      \r\n\r\nI am curious to learn more about how the Stoic would approach disciplining his thought processes.  How would a Stoic approach matters of career, love or business?  Do Stoics believe in taking a relaxed, passive attitude to life, or a proactive attitude?  I am hoping that this course can help to shine light on these questions as well as assist me in developing a deeper understanding of the material.  I am also aware that there is much material that I have not yet read, I would like some guidance as far as what to read and in what order.\r\n  \r\nBest Wishes,\r\n\r\nDevin Joel Petroff\r\nAugust, 2014', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, '', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', 1, 0, '', ''),

As part of that quest, I’ve read many books on philosophy, cognitive science, positive psychology, and other relevant topics. Most recently, I\'ve spend a few years reading about a secular Buddhist approach to life and practicing meditation. I felt that there was a lot of anecdotal as well as scientific evidence to support the idea that Buddhist philosophies and techniques increase life satisfaction and happiness. However, over time I felt like I  was no longer progressing in my study of Buddhism or practice of meditation.  Many things about Buddhism ring true, but it seems like it has few practical tools to use to improve your life. Certainly, meditation is a powerful tool, but I found it didn’t help me answer the question of how to act in life. Buddhism tells us to release expectations and clinging, but I found myself repeatedly returning to the question: Okay, but then what DO I do? How do I act? When I need to choose between going out with a friend or staying home, how do I choose if I’m working to accept that what is at the moment is perfect?\r\n\r\nAround that time, I read a book called "The Antidote: Happiness for People Who Can\'t Stand Positive Thinking" and was intrigued to hear the author reference Stoicism. I had taken intro to philosophy courses in college, but they had only touched on Stoicism. The book just brushes on Stoicism as well as other approaches to increasing well-being through techniques that deviate from “positive thinking.” As a result of this book, I read William Irvine\'s "A Guide to the Good Life: The Ancient Art of Stoic Joy" and found that his description of Stoicism lined up with many approaches to life that I had come to on my own, plus added a philosophical structure and additional techniques. I\'ve spent the past few months attempting to practice Stoic techniques and understand and life the philosophy. In the meantime, I\'ve read Donald Robertson\'s "Stoicism and the Art of Happiness" as well as Epictetus\' "Enchiridion." I’ve also joined a couple of Stoicism Facebook pages and I’ve been reading the discussion there.  I’m at a point where I need to read more, and perhaps have someone to interact with who can help me think through the problems I encounter in daily life. I’ve been attempting to practice a morning and evening planning/review session. In the morning, usually on my run, I think about the day and events I might encounter and how I could address them from a Stoic perspective. In the evening, I review the events of the day to understand where I might have done better.\r\n\r\nAs an atheist, I struggled a bit with the religious content of Stoicism. The philosophy of Stoicism bases its justification on the idea that Zeus created human as rational beings and maximizing our human potential by being rational brings us in alignment with nature. I do not believe I am a creation of Zeus, so this logic doesn\'t ring true to me. However, I found William Irvine\'s explanation of how a Stoic philosophy works because of our tendencies as evolutionary creatures to be satisfying. I also find it satisfying that Stoic techniques line up well with what science has discovered about how the human psyche works.\r\n\r\nMy life is pretty complicated at the moment – my marriage is ending, I have a new relationship forming, I have two children, I have a full time job, and I have an active and complicated social life. There are lots of ways that I could be dissatisfied with my life if I allowed myself to look at it that way. My first forays into applying a Stoic philosophy to the challenges I encounter have been very successful in reducing dissatisfaction and anxiety and allowing me to experience and appreciate the joy in the every day. Simply understanding and applying the “Stoic fork” has reduced my stress considerably. When I encounter something that raises anxiety or anger in me, I ask myself “Is this something under my control?” If the answer is “no,” I try to release it. “It is nothing to me.” I try to remind myself that only my reactions and goals are under my control. I remind myself that the only thing that contributes to my Happiness (Eudaimonia) is whether I am acting in accord with virtuous principles. These techniques have allowed me to have some success in no longer chasing after desire for things not under my control. Buddhism also teaches us that the path to tranquility and joy is to recognize that we do not have control, but I feel that Stoicism has given me better techniques for actually living that philosophy.  For example, I try to apply the “Stoic fork” frequently in parenting. When my kids act in ways that are different than I wish, I remind me that their behavior is out of my control. When I ask myself what is in my control, I realize it’s how I think about their behavior and what intentions I set for myself. When I ask myself what the right intentions are for my response, I realize that virtue here lies in correcting them since it is my job to teach them appropriate behavior - but not responding with anger or frustration.\r\n\r\nRight now, I do tentatively consider myself a Stoic. What I understand of the philosophy makes sense to me and is a logical progression of how I have been attempting to live my life. I\'d like to take this course in order to learn more about Stoicism, and to more rigorously explore and understand how to integrate Stoicism in my life. I am excited by the idea of having a coach who can help me think through daily obstacles I encounter and how a Stoic might address them. I do understand Stoicism at a high level right now, but sometimes I struggle with how to live my life on a daily basis in a way that aligns with the philosophy.', 1, '', 0, 0, 0, '', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', 1, 0, '', ''),

However, I\'m going to brave this one in the hope of helping a friend.\r\n\r\nMy history with Stoicism officially began in 2003, when I picked up an Everyman volume of Marcus Aurelius while browsing in a bookstore in Russian River, CA. I had no idea who Marcus Aurelius was, or Stoicism as a school of thought. It would be two more years before I saw "Gladiator". At the time, I liked the prose enough to purchase the book and keep it near my bed for reading when I felt discouraged or depressed. \r\n\r\nMy engagement with philosophy, history and early Greek and roman literature began much, much earlier. I was one of two girls in a large family of boys; we were LDS/Mormon. Some things were very traditional and some were not. My father was not a convert to the LDS church until much later, so books like "The Gulag Archipelago" and Durant\'s twelve or thirteen volumes of The History of Civilization lined the bottom shelf. They weighted to bookcase to keep it from falling over, so the titles were the first thing I could read ("Daddy what\'s a \'Gulag\'?"). Gender roles were rigidly enforced, I was expected to marry, not necessarily further my education. My sister, 8 years older than I was, was the first in our family to go to college and she had a great deal of trouble because I would run away with her textbooks and read them. In this way, I read The Norton Anthology for Literature and Gardner\'s History of Art. \r\n\r\nDiscussing how I became who I am is strikingly like the description of making sausage, and now I\'m on the table. I had the usual troubles of being bullied, being intelligent and female, sexual victimization. The LDS church and I parted ways in 1992. One of my younger brothers, 13, crept out of the house in the middle of the night, stole a car and crashed it, collapsing a light post and killing himself. My mother, in a fit of pique when he clogged the toilet, had wished him dead two weeks earlier. She was the one to find his bed empty when he didn\'t appear at breakfast. I married very early to escape the mess at home, a man who kept live hand grenades in the hall closet. I divorced him six months later when he threatened to make me leave college- didn\'t much care one way or the other about the hand grenades. I did graduate, got my degree in Psychology. A man attempted to rape me in 1996- I fought him off, chased him away. Later, I identified him in a lineup and testified against him, putting him in prison for at least 6 months with time for good behavior. When I was 25, I ensured my grandmother died in her own home. She had chemotherapy 8 different times over 10 years. I figured, anything over 6 gets you a free pass to die where you want. My family didn\'t feel the same way, wanted her put in a rest home. I provided direct care and end of life care for her, by myself. One of the scariest and most rewarding things I have ever done, but I\'ve never regretted it. I haven\'t talked to my family since then, and it\'s been 13 years now. \r\n\r\nI don\'t mention these things because I\'m necessarily proud of them or think they\'re good fodder for filling out an essay. I\'ve just returned from living abroad in June, and one thing I\'ve noticed about people in the United States is that they have no problem leaving absolutely no mystery about themselves whatsoever- they have no personal boundaries, and I\'m not like that.\r\n\r\nI\'m mentioning these things because I believe in being an improvement in the lives around me, of contributing something back to the people who are in my life. I believe in that very strongly. One of the reasons I\'ve always loved Marcus Aurelius is because he\'s always talking about how we\'re made to work together like joints or fingers on a hand, not against each other. \r\n\r\nI\'ve carried Marcus Aurelius around with me for years, even abroad when I lived overseas, and then gone looking for it when I gave my copy to someone who appeared to benefit. By chance, in May I discovered my first fellow Stoic. I had never given thought to other Stoics authors besides Marcus Aurelius before then. Never really read Epictetus or Seneca thoroughly. Marcus Aurelius and I agreed on the basic principles of how to live a good life, and I find living a simple quiet life very agreeable and not very challenging. I have seen far, far too much pain in my life to wish to perpetuate it, and that is a large part of my attitude towards others and living. Now, for the first time I have someone who wishes to actually discuss Stoic precepts and incorporate them into everyday living. He is curious how I got to where I am, and I have no idea how to describe the way, it’s just something I did. \r\n\r\nIn my teens, I was regularly sent for a week in the mountains for annual church camp. It was females only. Part of this annual week was a hiking trip that got progressively longer as you got older. When I was 15, the trip was a 3-day backpacking trek. At the time I had cut my foot on a submerged branch while wading in a creek, and I was walking with a stick I had whittled out. At the end of the second day, my group had been walking for six or seven miles and we were confronted with a last ridge before making our campsite. I was walking a bit slower, so by the time I got to the ridge all the girls were sitting at the bottom of the ridge, crying. I went past them, up the ridge, dropped my bag, and came back down. One by one, I came back for each girl and dragged them sobbing back over the ridge and deposited them at the campsite, going back for the next. I had a stick, you see, and they did not. That’s what sticks are for, for helping people. \r\n\r\nI have a stick now, and that stick is Marcus. I need to get someone up the ridge- I’m now writing this essay to ask for a map and flashlight. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n', 1, '', 0, 0, 0, '', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', 1, 0, '', ''),

My free time is spent sewing, reading or watching nerdy TV shows.  Probably the most unique thing about me is that I love to go to conventions and cosplay.  That is mainly what I sew, costumes the accessories to go with it, as well as a smattering of clothing, and of course mending and the. \r\nUp until March of 2013 my life went rather as planned, finishing college, moving away, getting married, and the house, the kids the whole 9 yards.  My husband and I moved from our childhood home of SW Florida to the Seattle area shortly after our wedding, and while being away from family and friends was difficult we loved the aesthetics of the area we had moved to.  My career never took off because of this move and the differing job requirements and structuring between the two areas, but it was a small price to pay and I was having fun.  My best friend moved up there shortly after and we explored our new state together.  I say I was having fun, and I enjoyed the good times, but for the most part I was not happy, not even content.  I can be somewhat of a perfectionist and am not a naturally positive person.  \r\nAfter several years my husband and I decided to have kids.  Becoming a mother was not an easy transition for me, and I did not take to it easily or naturally.  Being so far from my family and only having one friend close by left me very isolated in a very difficult and dark time, both mentally and literally giving the timing of my daughters’ birth to the long gray winters up in Washington.  A desire arose in me to go “home” as I had started referring to Florida, where my parents and sisters were.  A short 16 months later our son was born.\r\n	In March of 2013 through a series of frustrating and unfortunate events my husband lost his job as a police officer.  This was a devastating blow to both our pride and our way of life.  We made the decision to move back to SW Florida.  He applied for a job at the agency he worked for when we lived in the area previously and we confidently sold our home, and moved back across the country.  There would be a significant pay cut, but we would be close to family which had become my mantra after having children.  Surely being close to family would solve my problems, would make me happy.  \r\nOur hopeful certainty for the future turned out to be unfounded.  After living with my parents a few months and getting our own place in anticipation of my husband getting a job, he was turned down from the agency he had previously worked.  Over the next few months this was repeated with most of the agencies in this area.  I focus on this period in our life because it is what turned me to Stoicism.  I spend quite a few nights crying myself to sleep.  Quite a few days sick to my stomach over the move, the predicament.  Thinking today would be the day we would get “the call”.  Dreaming and fantasizing about each small glimmer of hope.  I almost started to have faith in a higher being, because I could not imagine random chance being so cruel.  I was raised Christian, and even though I am sure the intent was to have me believe and follow a “loving” God, the concept of the Christian God came through more vindictive and mean to me.  In January of this year, I, in my almost superstitious faith that was starting to arise in me decided that I must stop hoping, must convince myself that we would never get the call; we would never be back “on top” as I called it in my mind.  I believed that if I could believe there was no hope, then finally things would start to go right again.  As if my hope was the thing that was keeping us from hitting rock bottom, that if I could let go of hope, then being truly at bottom would start to move up again, specifically my husband would get back in Law Enforcement, we could start rebuilding our life as it was.\r\nEven as this ridiculously circular belief began to sneak its way into my mind I knew that things were getting out of hand.  A search for a non religious version of the serenity prayer led me to the first thought of stoicism as an actual modern belief.  The Wikipedia page led me to Epictetus and some of his sayings.  They struck a cord with me.  If only I could feel like that, if only I could have that calm.  I searched for modern stoics and was surprised to find that there was such a thing.  I first came across the blog Stoicism Today, and after a week or so of considering it I printed off the Stoic Week handbook and followed it for a week, and then another just for good measure.  \r\nBetween that day and now I have read everything I could get my hands through the library.  Marcus Aurelius has been my favorite so far.  I find the small bite size format to be the easiest to incorporate into my days.  And his simply style comforting.  I struggled through Epictetus finally finding and finishing the edition suggested for this course after two failed attempts.  I really enjoyed how he could hit a point home, and found him to be humorous at times, but a bit pretentious as well.  I just finished Seneca’s Letter from a Stoic and enjoyed that quite a bit.  I have pre-read the curriculum for this course including Sellar’s Stoicism and Mneme Manual, as well as started on the recommended reading list.  At least the books I can get through interlibrary loans.  I attempted and failed Becker’s A New Stoicism finding it a bit too academic for me.  I have read The Conscious Cosmos the link on your website, and greatly enjoyed Irvine’s A Guide to the Good Life.  I have just started Graver’s Stoicism and Emotion.    \r\nAs for religions, as I stated above I was raised as a protestant Christian.  Currently I don’t have a religion.  I try to think of it as little as possible, as my years of indoctrination leave me unable to be an atheist, yet I cannot commit to the blind faith of Christianity.  Nor do I desire to try to.  I am interested in how stoicism relates to religion as it seems to be able to blend in with just about any available religion.  I do struggle a bit when the authors refer to God, Gods, fate and such notions that seem to have a strong religious bent to me.  The idea of a conscious cosmos is hard for me to swallow as well.  I do the best when I think that the Stoics use these terms to refer to whatever the popular belief at the time is and that their belief is more secular with God or Fate being random chance based on all previous actions.  I believe several of the readings I have reviews have suggested this view.\r\nI have not studies any philosophies for what I mentioned above.  As for do I consider myself a stoic.  I would be hesitant to call myself that in any public conversations because of how novice I am and how often I still struggle with irrational anger and frustration.  Especially in dealing with my two children who are developmentally at the stage where they constantly challenge my authority in attempts to discover who they are and what the rules are.   I believe that with time I will slowly slip into the designation and become more comfortable with it.  That being said I do practice the stoic principals I have learned and am continuing to learn.  I am always hesitant to label myself until I am comfortable with my identity as a product of that label.  \r\nI would like this course to be a stepping stone to taking the year long program.  I hope to come out of it with a better understanding of stoicism then I would be able to grasp just reading the materials on my own.  I also am excited at a chance to speak with the mentor and get advice on how to put stoic principals into practice in daily modern life.  \r\n', 1, '', 0, 0, 0, '', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', 1, 0, '', ''),

I am a migrant from Ukraine living in Australia. My parents left Ukraine in 1991 amid an economic chaos and poverty I was 14 years old at a time. We escaped to Israel and lived there for 6 years, then at 22 I have migrated to Australia. I come from the family of doers. My Dad is a very energetic men (he is one now at the age of 76) have always been good with his hands, build two storey house by himself. Growing up I have been strongly influenced by his energy and optimism. I  have his makeup but has always been prone to bouts of anxiety that has has accompanied me my whole life. I have learned to manage it, but it is still there. I see myself as a doer, albeit an anxious one :-). \r\nI have always been going through my life on kind of autopilot. I have always heard “follow your feelings and passions” I have been following my feelings, I went to Uni, discovered I have strong yearning for knowledge and spent there 9 years obtaining PhD in telecommunications. I have had a string of disillusions. I wanted to stay in academia but was not skilled enough to obtain a position. I went to industry and for 8 years in industry was more and more disillusioned with my career. \r\nI am 38 now and totally lost all the passion and love of my job and career. I am also with the partner whom I dearly love but we will not be able to have children due to her health condition and she is not interested. I am on the other hand would love to have kids, I would love to leave legacy, to grow, teach and nourish, I have a lot of warmth to give.\r\n\r\nI am at a point where I do a lot of soul searching and meaning searching.  have realized some time ago, how much I am driven by feelings of the moment especially during anxiety attacks, and found an interesting book based on positive psychology “ACT” where author describes feelings as clouds that passing through and very fickle and ever changing. I got really interested, did various exercises where you try to disengage from your feelings and observe them from the side. I found them really helpful, but being a very inquisitive person I started digging origins of this therapy and came across stoicism. \r\n\r\nI have been interested in stoicism for about a year. I have started from reading Seneca “on shortness of life” and “On a piece of mind”. What I find fascinating is how ancients have really understood a human mind. In “peace of mind” for instance, he describes how our minds are very “nimble and apt for movement”, lot of men can not find peace within themselves, they try to change scenery, look for entertainment outside and never find peace. I can Identify with this feeling. Or the practice to live on a thin soup number of days a week to practice poverty, so we better appreciate where we are now. I do have a job now, but I am quite unhappy about it, I find it hard to appreciate that I have a paying job, able to pay my bills and travel a bit. Probably eating thin soup will not help me to appreciate life more so I am looking for other exercises. But the most empowering part of Stoicism I find in enchiridion of Epictetus in some of his sections. I have printed them and carry in my wallet, and when I feel I need help I reread them. Breaking our reality in what I can and I can\'t control; Wish for the life to be the way it is and not to wish more, Its all about our perceptions rather than reality etc. \r\nI find some help in meditations of Marcus Aurelius. His writings revolve a lot (amongst other things) around shortness of life. Some moments in my life I feel about the person “Oh he/she is so smart, achieved so much in his/her life I wish I could be in their shoes”. I think of what Marcus said, not to consider people happy just because they are important or think about famous people that lived and now dust.  \r\n\r\nI am thinking of myself as partly stoic (I don\'t agree with everything). I think reasoning is our major most useful tool in life. Personally it doesn\'t answer my yearnings in life (i.e, how can I find a passion in my job again or how will I fulfill myself with no children) and where I find quite a bit difficulty as quite a passionate person is that stoics advocate to avoid all passions and pursue apathy to have a peace of mind. I am still struggling to understand, do I have to live all my dreams and ambitions behind in order to pursue stoicism? \r\nI am also an atheist, I firmly believe we have power enough to be good, to leave our lives to the full and no intervention of God is required.\r\n\r\nI want to do the course, because I believe Stoicism does have a lot to offer, I believe in core ideas of stoics so well presented in Enchiridion. I want change my attitude for life, to live in present more instead of worrying a lot about future. To appreciate more where I am now. And have a courage to accept some things and change what can be changed.\r\n\r\nFrom the stoic philosophy I have read:\r\nSeneca: On peace of mind; On shortness of life; Letters from Stoic\r\nMarcus Aurelius: Meditations\r\nEpictetus: The Enchiridion\r\n\r\nFrom other philosophies I was interested in Epicurus, but there is little information about it, from what I understand it is a pleasure oriented philosophy. True pleasures are in simple things, like friendships, pen and a notebook to write your thoughts , simple food etc. which is very true, but they had to physically isolate themselves from the world (the garden where they lived). I want to live in the real world.\r\n', 1, '', 0, 0, 0, '', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', 1, 0, '', ''),

However, I have only started consciously to incorporate some Stoic practices into my life over the past decade. My primary interest and practice has been, and continues to be, Christian spiritual practices (specifically Hesychasm), which of course derive in great part from Stoic practices. As I have delved further into the former, my awareness of the importance of the latter has also grown.\r\n  	Perhaps we should not read too much into it, but as a child, my father gave me the nickname “Marcus Aurelius Spingolius Septeranius Pluturitus Maximus.” I feel justified, therefore, in claiming a divine right to my Stoic heritage!\r\n	I probably first read Marcus Aurelius’ Meditations in high school, and I have read it a few times since. I carry Epictetus’ Discourses with me; it’s the only book I carry with me other than a prayer book. I have read several of Pierre Hadot’s books, which were another factor in my renewed interest in Stoicism. In addition, as a professor of philosophy, I find the emphasis on “philosophy as a way of life” (PWL) very appealing, though I have grown to disagree with Hadot’s division of philosophy as a way of life (philosophy itself) and philosophy as theory (PT, or discourse about philosophy). The division just doesn’t hold up historically, or in my own experience, though other aspects of Hadot’s views are helpful (such as the turn away from PWL to academic philosophy in the universities of the Middle Ages). I have also read some of Seneca’s letters, a study with absolutely fascinating correlations and tensions with the Hesychastic tradition. \r\n	I usually would not refer to myself by any title such as atheist, agnostic, deist, or theist, but I am certainly not any of the first three. I was raised Presbyterian, but the only Stoicism in Presbyterianism is the immense patience it requires to sit through a service (regretfully, a virtue that I do not seem to have acquired). I am an Orthodox Christian, and a practitioner of Hesychasm (Eastern Orthodox spiritual practices). The links between Stoic practices and those of Hesychasm are plentiful and profound. Hesychasm incorporates the therapeutic of the passions, various kinds of meditation on future events (including the meditation on future blessings and ills, and the memento mori), practices of physical and moral purification, and many others. Of course, Hesychasm is rooted in a Christian cosmology that is essentially different in many points from Stoicism, especially insofar as Christian spirituality begins with fallenness and sin, concepts largely, if not entirely, absent from Stoicism. [I would qualify that slightly, as I am sure there must be Stoic philosophers from the later Greco-Roman time period, who incorporated such ideas into Stoicism.]\r\n	I am a professor of philosophy, so I have studied many different philosophical systems. My primary interests are Platonism, Existentialism (esp. Kierkegaard), and Postmodernism. However, I also teach Comparative Religions, so I have a long-standing interest in Hinduism and Buddhism, in particular. I am very interested in questions concerning the relationships between different philosophical systems and faiths, though I do not ascribe to any one theory. In fact, I believe that each tradition is an integrated whole, and that too many forms of comparison simply attempt to elide the differences between the traditions in order to effect some kind of facile unity. \r\n	For the same reason, I would not refer to myself as a Stoic, though I have benefitted greatly from Stoic philosophy and practices over the years. As the Stoics taught, learning to examine the self and to become one’s self is a lifelong work, and it is certainly the case that one can learn how to do this work from many different traditions. Each tradition opens different perspectives on this work, and can be beneficial at different times in different ways. \r\n	A key component in the way that I teach philosophy is that I emphasize the mutual implication of cosmology (theories or beliefs about the structure of the cosmos), anthropology (theories or beliefs about the structure of human beings), and ethics (in the sense of ethical practices, or practices of “subject formation”). One aspect of Stoicism that I have yet to grasp fully is the way in which Stoic anthropology and cosmology inform the Stoic ethical practices. In addition, I have more specific questions that I would like to examine within the Stoic context, and I look at the College of Stoic Philosophers course as an opportunity to do so. For example, on the issue of the passions, some Stoics argue that we should strive to control them, while others (including Seneca) argue that we are not truly philosophers until we eradicate them. Of course, we can find this controversy in many different traditions (including Hesychasm, and Christian spirituality generally), but it is exactly the kind of question that needs to be addressed from within the cosmological and anthropological context each tradition. This describes, to a large extent, the kind of work – textual and spiritual – that I do in regard to Hesychasm, by the way. \r\n	From the course, then, I look to glean further insights into my own motivations, to find ways to employ Stoic practices into my life. I am interested not in poaching Stoicism for practices and insights, but in entering into Stoicism as fully as possible. I recognize that this results in a possibly irresolvable conundrum, given what I have said about the integrity of traditions. How can a Christian fully engage Stoicism (or vice versa, for that matter)? I cannot answer that question, and I view my participation in the curriculum of the Stoic College as an opportunity to attempt to find an answer to it. \r\n	Finally, I hope also to learn something about teaching and learning online, and about the resources and methods for creating and maintaining an educational program like the College of Stoic Philosophers. I am in the process of creating a course based on Hesychasm, and I am sure that participating in the College of Stoic Philosophers program would be very informative in that regard as well. \r\n	\r\n\r\n	\r\n', 1, '', 0, 0, 0, '', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', 1, 0, '', '');

I am William Coad. I am 24 years of age and currently live in Adelaide, South Australia. I have lived in Adelaide my whole life however when I was 12 years of age I travelled Europe with my family. I have a younger sister. I currently have a girlfriend of 3 and half years. I work for the State Government as a public servant. I am saving my earnings in the hope to buy a home with my partner. I also aim to do a lot of travelling in Asia and Europe in the near future.\r\n \r\nI first encountered Stoicism at the age of 17. I most enjoy reading about Ancient history. I was reading about the Roman Republic, specifically about Julius Caesar and the civil wars. A skilled orator and politician appealed to me, Marcus Tullius Cicero. Upon reading more about Cicero I noted the word “Stoic” and inquisitively searched for its meaning. I was immediately intrigued by this school of philosophy. The concept of calm and control were instantly appealing. As I read more about Stoicism I became even more accepting and excited about the school’s teachings.\r\n \r\nI completed my Introduction to Stoicism many years ago with the help of Frank Wagle. After successfully completing my (IS) I knew I had made the correct decision in my path towards “a grand goal of living” as William B. Irvine would put it. I enjoyed reading “Stoicism: A guide to the good life” so much that I read it again and made notes on various paragraphs. I also read Seneca’s letters and Marcus Aurelius’ mediations with great joy and interest.\r\n \r\nI enjoy reading about the lives of Seneca, Epictetus and Cato the Younger. However my favourite Stoic philosopher is Marcus Tullius Cicero, in particular for his efforts in bringing the Stoic philosophy to Rome where it would flourish.\r\n \r\nI believe I need assistance and guidance in establishing myself as an atheist, agnostic, deist or theist. I like to believe in a prime mover, a force that is a part of everything in the universe. I dislike the notion of being a Stoic atheist even though the idea of an unconscious nature is appealing to me. Seeking clarity on this matter will help my Stoicism as I move forward in my learning and practice.\r\n \r\nI was brought up in a religious household. My parents are Roman Catholic and I was raised in the same faith. My sister and I were sent to Roman Catholic schools. However, I would not claim to be a ‘member’ of this religious faith or any other. From my youth I have always struggled to conform to the idea of faith alone. Growing up, I felt comfortable with reason for the answers to the observations I would make each day. I was not interested in the idea that a man could be divine and the son of God. The story of miracles in the Bible was at times absurd to me. I could not convince myself to believe that a man could be “miraculous” and only influence his local area at the time. As an alternative for my grand goal of living I adopted a form of enlightened hedonism. I would seek pleasure and avoid pain but at the same time I would not overindulge or completely avoid these two feelings. It would be monitored in a way that could achieve maximum happiness and contentment.\r\n \r\nHowever, with my time studying Stoicism I have moved away from my enlightened hedonism and have instead aimed to employ Stoicism as my grand goal of living. It became immediately apparent that Stoicism could provide a new way of thinking, observing, learning and living. What was most appealing to me was that Stoicism had the potential to me give me insight and understanding to almost anything. Any negative emotion or any troublesome issue could be addressed with Stoic wisdom.\r\n \r\nI have been reading and practicing Stoicism for many years, however I know there is so much more to learn and experience. I consider myself an amateur Stoic as I am developing my habit to practice Stoicism in all my situations and moments. I think I need clarity on my interpretation of some readings. Sometimes I feel as if I do not have a solid foundation for my Stoicism. I want to be able to feel as if I am using Stoicism at each moment, sometimes I think to myself that I have forgotten it or how to use it correctly. I am looking to be directed on to the right path which will assist in consolidating my understanding of Stoicism fully. A part from understanding Stoicism fully, I wish to know how to use it at any time and during any circumstance. At the moment, as a metaphor, I view Stoicism as a beautiful fruit bearing tree, however I do not know how to properly use the harvested fruit.\r\n \r\nIn my youth I remember being at odds with others in my schooling years. This was caused by my judgement about the actions and character of others. I was constantly disturbed by the immaturity or promiscuity of my friends and fellow classmates. The judgement quickly turned into a negative dissatisfaction with the world. I always cared immensely about the virtue of others and this usually caused problems with my overall outlook on how we should live our lives. This was probably the most discontent time of my life. I was unhappy and unsure of how I should feel towards my emotions, although I knew my negativity was not the answer to the issue.\r\n \r\nI aim to achieve tranquillity of the mind as all other Stoics aim to do. I want to develop positive habits for my grand goal of living. I understand that Stoicism takes devoted practice and implementation at every moment. I am determined to pursue this grand goal of living, to have perpetual tranquillity.

This experience was perhaps the catalyst for my interest in history and natural science.\r\n\r\nIt became evident as I learnt more about our world and the universe that I was not going to be satisfied with faith and prayer as having the “answers”. For years I searched for a structured approach to life and how to live it well.

I am, at time of writing, 20 years old, and living in Australia, having moved here from Scotland. This monumental move was based on the fact that my father - a petroleum engineer and researcher - had recently lost his job, and was picked up by a company and offered a place in either Canada, Brazil or Australia. Australia was chosen on the basis that raising a family there would be much easier - I was 16 at the time. I won\'t deny that it was a hard move for me, it was - and those stresses still resonate in my family today.\n\nI\'m currently studying Laboratory Medicine at Curtin University, entering my third year (of four). Its interesting, stimulating and rather difficult, but its the best kind of challenge. I\'m specialising in Haematology, Pathology and Cytology - so blood, tissue and cell studies, respectively. I find blood work especially fascinating - all disorders known to medicine influence the blood somehow, and this fluid made of cells can change in so many different ways. I have a girlfriend, Michelle, an artist who I\'ve been with for four years now. Shes interesting, stimulating and rather difficult as well, but I wouldn\'t change her. I\'ve known her since high school, and she has and will be a huge influence on my life - keeping me sane, I call it, amongst the stresses of exams and a Medicine degree.\n\nIn terms of significant and guiding events - aside from the move to Australia - I can\'t say I\'ve lived long enough to have many. Meeting Michelle, getting the responsibility of a part time job for the first time, and my first days of university would be the only ones that would spring to mind. Despite this, I feel like I have seen a serious portion of the planet - having visited many countries. I could say that I feel \'world weary\', but I know that that could only apply to someone rather older than I! I consider starting university rather significant, it set me on the path I\'m on now, that I\'ll follow for the rest of my days. \n\nAs for the Stoic questions you posed to me - I\'ve been interested in Stoicism for roughly 6 months or so now, after being referred to a Reddit post on discipline. This post referenced Marcus Aurelius and his Meditations many times - which piqued my curiosity. One quick search in the university library and one sleepless night spent reading later, and I was hooked. Finally, a philosophy I could get behind that doesn\'t need religious interaction, doesn\'t preach itself and has some fantastic literature behind it. Currently, aside from Meditations (which I\'ve currently loaned out to a friend of mine), I have also devoured Epictetus\' Enchiridion and (some of) the Discourses. I also read three quarters of Seneca\'s Letters, before exams kicked in. I started on Sellars\' Stoicism, but decided to leave that when I decided upon joining the College, given that it is part of the curriculum. \n\nI would consider myself an agnostic, based upon scientific beliefs - unless you can prove the existence of something, there can only be doubt if it exists. However, the fact that so many believe in something, and don\'t need proof, must count for something, right? Blind faith can\'t be so widespread without some basis. Of course, following this, I don\'t have an religious faith, though I was brought up a Christian (but never baptised).\n\nI have not studied any other philosophies other Stoicism, except from a passing interesting in Buddhism, but from a philosophical point of view, again. I spent a lot of time searching for a philosophy I could follow - I felt the meet for a driving set of rules and philosophies. \n\nI do consider myself a Stoic, though a rather inexperienced and uninitiated one. I try to follow Stoic philosophy, meditations and thought processes, but it gets hard. I try to use the lessons I\'ve learnt - especially during the time-appropriate Stoic Week ran by Exeter University. I think I do rather well - but I feel that, like the ancient Stoics, a more formal education is required. I put great stock in that sort of effort and its goals, so I daresay that with the increased information will come an increase in quality of living.\n\nAnd that is a rather perfect link to the final question posed to me - "what do you want from this course". That is both simple and complex. I want knowledge, affirmation, certified acknowledgment of the work I have made into improving my life. But I also want something more than a piece of paper - I want a school o f thought I can get behind, one that I can say I belong to without doubt nor fear of ridicule. I want a set of rules I can set myself without doubting their authenticity or meaning - and though, so far Stoicism has provided this, I crave more. I want the ability to crave Stoicism to something I can use - but to do that, I need to understand it far better than I do now. \n\nThe appeal that Stoicism has for me is not something I can really put to paper - the best way I can say it is that it resonates with my own personal and ethical viewpoints. I like the no nonsense approach Stoicism has, along with it giving exercises for keeping temper and interrupting emotions in check. It offers a way of mentally keeping a check of yourself, creating discipline for yourself, beyond the word of a wordless God but through the \'will\' of Nature - which admittedly is still something I don\'t understand very well. \n\nAnd with that, I come to the end of my essay, frustratingly short of the thousand words required as it is. I hope that I still gain entry to the College, and if my Mentor is reading this, I hope that our time together is fruitful - fate permitting, of course!\n', 1, '', 0, 0, 0, '', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', 1, 0, '', ''),

My educational background is in business management so my exposure to the subject of Philosophy is very limited.\n\nI must admit that I became interested in stoicism just recently, I’d say about three months ago. It started when I chanced upon a site called “Modern Stoicism” through a link recommended by a fitness site that I’m subscribed in.\n\n I have been searching all my life for answers to life’s questions, I’ve been through a lot of life’s tribulations and somehow managed to survive and thrived, mostly on my own. \n\nI recently participated in their stoic week 2014 course that just concluded. After that, I felt that it was not enough and that there was an urge inside me to learn more and dig deeper into stoicism. I am planning to join their other course that runs for a month when it becomes available. As of now, I’m still doing the stoicism one week program on my own.\n\nOf all the stoic books I have read so far, it was “The Enchiridion” by Epictetus has the greatest impact on me. I have read and re-read the book three times already and has been a part of me ever since. I start and end my day with a passage from the book. Whenever there’s an opportunity, I glance on whatever passage my fingers will chance upon. \n\nLetters from a Stoic by Seneca is also a great one. Although I have gone through the book just once, the best medium of exposure for me is the podcast series that I play in the car when going to work and coming back home.\n\nI just started to skim through the Meditations by Marcus Aurelius. No serious reading yet but will start as soon as I’m done with my re-reading of The Enchiridion.\n\nStoicism Today by Patrick Ussher was a giveaway during the stoic week 2014. I would say that this book helped me a lot as I eased in into the subject of stoicism. \n\nI would consider myself more of being deist because I believe in the existence of God with less emphasis on supernatural causation or revelation. As a child, I believed in Santa Claus until I saw my father putting candies inside my Christmas stockings. I was told not to question the bible and just believe in the word of God after I noticed and begun asking questions about the overlaps and contradictions. I am not inclined to quickly believe the teachings of various religions. I always examine if the words of their teaching is consistent with the acts and deeds of their members. Unfortunately, almost all of them does not. Despite all the questions I have in my head, I can’t deny the existence of God either through reason or deep examination of my heart.\n\nI was baptized as a Roman Catholic. My parents were Catholics but I was educated in a protestant /evangelical school (from kindergarten up to high school) not for any other reason but only because of its proximity to our house. Then, back to catholic school in college.\n\nI am not a practicing catholic right now but I still go to church out of love and respect for my devoted catholic wife. I also love the serenity of the place especially before mass. Although my children were baptized Catholics, I will never force the doctrine upon them and will let them decide for themselves when they are of the right age and thinking. \n\nI had a deep fascination with occult studies and hermetics when I was younger because of the promise of supernatural powers. As I got older, the fascination turned into amusement. I realized that the secret knowledge found in the book was not actually a secret since it was shared with the other thousand readers who bought the same book as I did. I guess it was brought about by the ignorance of youth.\n\nRalph Waldo Emerson specifically his essay on self-reliance has the greatest impact on me during my challenging years. His message provided me with the inspiration to face the challenges in my life head on. His works has been my refuge as I seek answers and understanding to so many of my questions. \n\nMy knowledge of philosophy is limited to the names of Plato, Socrates, and Aristotle. I studied logic and ethics in college because they were required subjects for graduation. Other than those, what I knew about philosophy can be considered general and superficial. Then, I stumbled upon “The Enchiridion” by Epictetus. The truth and practicality of the message was something I already know but still it felt new. I can’t explain it but the truthfulness of the message just jumped out of the book straight into my head and heart. There is no doubt that Epictetus through his “Discourses” by Arrian or the modern interpretation in the “Manual for Living”, can and will withstand the test of time.\n\nBased on my participation in the stoic week 2014, I would consider myself as having the inclination to be a stoic. I share the same view/outlook of a stoic without even being mindful of it. While I maybe a couple of lifetimes away to be a sage, I might as well live like a stoic right now and live a happy life at the present,\n\nI’m hoping that this course will provide me a very good starting point in an academic format with proper mentorship as I embark on my stoic journey. I would like to apply the principles of stoicism into my life. My interest is not just in studying this philosophy but on living it.          \n        \nI expect the course to provide me the proper guidance that after completion, will enable me to dig deeper into the very essence of stoicism. I wish (not want so as to give them the freedom to decide for themselves later on) to introduce this philosophy to my children. I know it will help them a lot (when applied) in facing their own challenges in life. \n', 1, '', 0, 0, 0, '', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', 1, 0, '', ''),

I was born in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada to two evangelical Christian parents. My parents are still married and appear happy, although they struggle with debt and continue to make poor health and financial decisions. I have a younger brother and sister with whom I never really got along with until I was happily married myself.\n\nIn my childhood I remember making a lot of lists and plans. At the age of eight my father took me to my first motivational speaker. I attended at least two or three more of these sessions before I was eleven years old. Speakers such as Jim Rohn, Peter Lowe and Zig Ziglar made me believe I could be anything. The trouble was, I couldn’t make any decisions about what it was I wanted to be.\n\nI looked frequently toward my father for approval and direction. I have come to regret many of the significant life decisions I’ve made as a result of leaning on his advice or seeking his approval. Early decisions I made, such as the decision to quit playing hockey, were based on my feelings that I was not playing up to his standard. Later decisions, such as to sell a business with a lot of potential to grow (I was an early participant in the CrossFit wave), for the cost of equipment, were also based on his guidance which lacked any vision or interest or belief in what I was pursuing as a passion.\n\nCountless hours over the course of my life have been spent in trying to set plans and direction for maximization of every facet of my life. To be the best person. To show the world I was not only smart, but useful. To do a work that was vital to every single person. To at the same time be well-adjusted, freakishly fit, and a great piano player too. And I’d do it all without going into debt. It was insane.\n\nThis tendency to want to optimize everything led me to develop a case of OCD around program design in exercise. I was writing 2-3 week-long or month-long programs for myself per week. If the urge came over me to change something in my program I had to completely overhaul the program before I could carry on with my day. This painful condition caused me to begin to fantasize about killing myself, and when those thoughts were the only thing that could help me fall asleep some nights I sought out professional help.\n\nIn Winter 2011 I had been married for 10 years. I was working as a paramedic. I had a 6 month old daughter and a 3 ½ year old son. Not wanting to place something like a suicide into my children’s life was the main reason that kept me from pursuing it. I began to see a therapist who confirmed my suspicion that I had some OCD, but made me feel very normal about it and showed me its roots in my anxieties of being a perfectionist. The healing I’ve experienced since then has been immense. None of those compulsions occur to me anymore. Anxiety, however, still knocks regularly at my door.\n\nI am still married, and my children are 6 and 3. My wife and children attend a church in the evangelical tradition, but I do not attend. There is a lot more history behind my involvement in the church, including time spent serving on the Board of Directors at an Evangelical Free Church, time spent in Kenya on a missionary trip, and two years as a “part-time” missionary in Winnipeg. I became very disillusioned with church in 2006. In 2007 after taking a university philosophy course I began to hold under the microscope all of my ideas about God and eventually came to the conclusion that I was an atheist.\n\nMy interest in Stoicism began around the same time (Winter 2007). I picked up “on the Shortness of Life” at a bookstore one day and read it four or five times in a row. I loved the perspective it provided me. \n\nSince that time I have read “Letters from a Stoic”, “Meditations”, and recently picked up “The Art of Living”. I’ve also read William Irvine’s book and many articles about Stoicism online. \n\nI have also, since that time, flirted with Anglicanism. There is a church in Winnipeg called “st benedict’s table” which has always been a safe place for me to explore my questions, ideas and spiritual emotions. Today, I would say that I believe in the Logos…. whether or not the Logos was Jesus is still a question under exploration for me. I am not a member of the Anglican church, and I currently attend st benedict’s table infrequently.\n\nWhen I became an atheist I was somewhat uncomfortable there and explored various other philosophies briefly. I looked into Zen Buddhism and Taoism. I found neither to be terribly appealing to me. When I realized I could be an atheist stoic, and that as a Stoic I could essentially wake up each day and get to work like the rest of my Western world, it made stoicism that much more appealing to me. \n\nToday I call myself a Stoic. Every once in awhile I might also be a somewhat reluctant Christian. But most days I’m a Stoic. \n\nIn this course I am hoping to refine some habits to help me stay oriented in my Stoicism. Somedays I wonder why I care SO much about virtue. Somedays I crave a spiritual experience, and I don’t know what to do about it - especially if it’s one of those days I wouldn’t call myself a Christian! \n\nI would like to add that thus far Stoicism has been immensely helpful in helping me manage the unique challenges of my work as a paramedic. I think that many of my coworkers would benefit from learning some of the wisdom of Stoicism and I would like to become better prepared to help spread the word.\n', 1, '', 0, 0, 0, '', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', 1, 0, '', ''),

More importantly, I am married with three great children that have allowed me the wonderful opportunity to practice Stoicism on a daily basis.\n\n I discovered Stoic philosophy while browsing through a used bookstore three years ago.

I was born in Stuttgart, Germany on August 21, 1968 to Indian parents. We immigrated to the USA before my first birthday. Subsequently,  spending the next 30 years living, studying, training, and working in a number of American cities, including Houston, Washington D.C., Syracuse, Los Angeles, New York City. In 1999, I sold all of my assets, packed my bags, and embarked on an graduate level program in France. After my studies, I continued to work and live in several European centers in Netherlands, Belgium, Germany, Spain, before settling down in Helsinki, Finland for the last 10 years. \n\nLike most people, my values and ethics were heavily influenced by my parents. My father exemplified the prototypical American dream; he grew up in a rural part of West Bengal, India with 9 siblings, no running water, or many material comforts. Through his tenacity and intellectual horsepower, he gained entrance and completed a PhD from Max Planck University’s physics program in Germany. I learned from my father the value of hard work, family, and “can-do” spirit. In many ways, my father exhibited stoic ideals of virtue, respect, and living in nature. Both my mother and father were devout Hindus, who espoused to the Vedanta philosophy and the teachings of Swami Vivekananda. Whilst I consider myself an agnostic, I was always interested in their daily puja routine (prayer / meditation) and subsequently adopted similar routines. \n\nIn addition to my parent’s guidance, I have been heavily influenced by the practice and philosophies of the martial arts. I have been a life-long martial artist with over 30 years of training in various disciplines including Brazilian jiu-jitsu under Professor Renzo Gracie, Kykoshin karate (2nd dan), Muay Thai, western boxing and wrestling. The martial arts are a vehicle for mastery, resilience, character building, personal improvement, and learning how to deal with adversity. Martial arts act as a mirror for self-reflection and enable me to understand myself better (mentally, physically, and spiritually. My life has been profoundly influenced by the philosophical teachings of Carlos Gracie Sr., Bruce Lee, Miyoto Mushashi, Jigaro Kano, as well as ancient Bushido teachings. In the spirit of the “Know Thyself” essay, my master Renzo Gracie once said, “I will die shitting in my pants, like everyone else, but knowing in the end, who I was; knowing 100% truly who I was.” \n\nIn addition to this, I am a Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) in Operations Management. Therefore, I have been exposed to the philosophy of social sciences in my academic work. Concepts such as epistemology and ontology are well known to me and I am able to view different philosophical teachings through these conceptual lenses. In my opinion, the best philosophies I have come across are not only sound theoretically, but have practical applications and can even act as a basic “operating system” for individuals in their daily lives. \n\nMy initial exposure to Stoicism happened serendipitously. About five years ago, I started engaging in a daily meditation practice. Around that time, I stumbled across the book, Meditations by Marcus Aurelius. I mistakenly thought it was a text on meditation techniques, practiced by Greco-Romans. Once I dove into his writings, I was fascinated by his reflections and insights of daily life. Yet, many of the passages in Meditations are simple, straight-forward, and practical for the lay man, without any previous knowledge of stoic thought.  During the time of Marcus Aurelius, the Roman empire went through difficult times, however his writings exemplified a sense of mental toughness and resilience, which I found inspiring. In life, we will all encounter tough times and in doing so, one should exhibit grit and perseverance. \n\nBe not discontented, be not disheartened, be not out of hope often it succeed not so well with thee punctually and precisely to do all things according to the right dogmata, but being once cast off, return to them again: and as for those many and more frequent occurrences, either of worldly distractions, or human infirmities, which as a man thou canst not but in some measure be subject unto, be not though discontented with them; but however, love and affect that only which thou dust return unto. \n   -Meditations – The Fifth Book IX\n\nSubsequent readings of “Letters from a Stoic” by Seneca and several essays on Stoicism provided me with a basic conceptual understanding of Stoic philosophy. The three main components of stoic philosophy: logic, physics, and ethics offer a holistic framework for an individual to live his / her life according to natural principles, which appeals to me. I found the readings to be pragmatic and quite useful in daily life. The little exposure that I have had to stoic philosophy peaked my curiosity to learn more about it; hence, my application to this program. I am at a time in my life, where I contemplate a lot about my existence and I seek deeper meanings to life’s mysteries. On my path, I have encountered many obstacles, where I could have approached things differently in retrospect. Through my own deep introspection, I strive to become a better partner, father, son, brother, and friend to my social circle, while being true to myself and ethics. I would not consider myself a stoic at this point, but I espouse to some of the logical precepts of stoicism and am interested in diving deeper into the topic, whereby my hope is to incorporate some of the philosophical elements into my daily life.\n\nIn addition to this, I feel that I could benefit from the mentorship aspect as well. In the past, I have acted as both a mentor and a mentee in professional, academic, and social settings. The mentor-mentee model of personal development is a powerful one and one of the main reasons to pursue this track at the College of Stoic Philosophers. It is my sincere hope that this program will help me in my journey to become a true man of virtue. I am open, humble, and eager to start on the path. \n', 1, '', 0, 0, 0, '', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', 1, 0, '', ''),

Until that time I was planning on entering higher education with a sole passion for studying history, however, being introduced to new and mind-altering philosophical concepts and figures truly changed that trajectory. The focus of my high school philosophy class was that of the ancient philosophers, Socrates, Plato, Aristotle and Zeno. Although the course was relatively broad and general it nonetheless inspired me into research of my own, which inevitably lead to profound personal development. In university I studied academic philosophy (AKA semantics) as well as classical civilizations and Latin. These programs of interest opened me up further to the different philosophical schools of thought that consequentially led me to the school that resonated with my mind most, Stoicism. \n\n     I hope that I can, after my educational life is complete, be properly placed in a career ‘fate permitting’ that allows me the opportunity to help others, just as the Stoic philosophers have helped me to realize both my potential for justice, happiness and tranquility of mind. “Men exist for the sake of one another”. \n\nIntroduction\n-------------\n\n     I was first introduced to Stoicism when I was at my local bookstore perusing through the philosophy section. At this time in my life I was trying to absorb as much information on philosophy and science as I was able. Seneca caught my eye because he was Roman (tugging on my inner classical historian) and a practical philosophy also (which I have never before that time indulged in). It was through my first reading of his dialogues: De Brevitate Vitae, Consolatio Ad Helviam, and De Tranquillitate Animi that lead me to realize that I had finally found my philosophy of life, a system of values and mindfulness that I can practice and thus gain a better understanding of what morality is as well as who I was. That being said, I have been a practicing Stoic for four years now and I see Stoicism as being an integral and inseparable part of my character. Stoicism is not something separate; it has become the driving force for my thoughts as well as my actions. \n\nOn Stoic Works\n------------------\n\n     Up until this date I have read the following works regarding Stoicism: Marcus Aurelius’ Meditations, I have read the meditations a handful of times and prefer both the Staniforth translation as well as the Hays translation of the emperors thoughts. Marcus Aurelius is the Stoic that I most admire. His actions, brave, wise and strong are a testament to the fortitude of his character given the uncertain, dangerous and treacherous times that he had to endure as emperor of Rome. \n\n     With regards to Seneca I read the three above texts once a year, however I have read through the entire Epistulae Morales ad Lucilium also. Currently Seneca is the Stoic philosopher that I relate to the most. I find that On the Tranquility of Mind provides one of the most lucid and thoughtful analyses of the human condition and that it is within the sphere of control of all rational agents to attain the measure of peace that we all seek, but few men ever find. \n\n     Both the Discourses and the Enchiridion have been instrumental in my self-discovery, particularly the guidebook. Epictetus’ maxims provide an excellent cognitive armamentarium for facing strenuous circumstances. Also, with regards to Epictetus, I have read the fragmentary texts of his teacher, Musonius Rufus, with great love for his views of diet. I have two forthcoming articles to be published on Stoicism Today regarding both Musonius Rufus, one is titled, “Is Vegetarianism Stoic?”. With regards to secondary source material on Stoicism I have read W.B. Irvine’s A Guide to the Good life, John Sellar’s The Art of Living, Donald Robertson’s The Philosophy of CBT, Pierre Hadot’s The Inner Citadel and the selected writings of Stoicism Today vol. 1. \n\n     Lastly, I have recently published an article titled, “Star Trek’s Stoics: The Vulcans” in Philosophy Now Magazine (Issue 106, Feb/Mar 2015) drawing connections between Stoicism and the Vulcan practical philosophy. Currently I am in the process of writing a book of dialogues centered on Stoicism, mental illness and social life. Although it is far from competition, I hope that it will have a instrumental impact, not only in a philosophical sense but also to educate people on the severity and stigma that is so often attributed to mental illness and those who suffer from it. \n\nOn Belief\n------------\n\n     When talking about of atheism, theism or deism I would consider myself an atheist, as in someone who doe not believe in, or worship any supernatural creating being/force. Although, I prefer not to be demarcated into a single category by a label - and have all the beliefs of that label attached to my belief falsely - I often use the term agnostic to refer to myself. \n\nOn Studying Philosophy \n---------------------------\n\n     I have studied philosophy for most of my young adult life at the university level, although, most of the curriculum did not focus on the true function of philosophy, that being, how to live a just and moral life. During this time at university I was introduced to the differing classical schools of thought, but none were discussed in any meaningful level of depth. Once I was introduced to Stoicism I saw that modern philosophy was lacking this element, the moral imperative to help oneself through philosophy as well as others. I believe that being a Stoic, and thus a civis mundi, it is our duty, as philosophers, to live a moral life and to help other to do so also. Therefore, I do consider myself a Stoic. I toiled with this term also for a long time, considering what can be changed from the doctrine of Stoicism and if when changed it can still be called that. I do not agree with all the tenents outlined in the writings. However, many of the writings by the different authors say different things, and not all advice by one is followed by the subsequent others. Therefore, although I do not hold a number of Stoic doctrine beliefs to be true, I still call myself a Stoic. \n\nDe Finibus \n-------------\n\n     I am hoping that through the journey of this course and further courses with the CoSP that I will gain a better and more intimate understanding not only of Stoic doctrine and ethics, but also of how Stoicism has helped to shape the life of my mentor, how his or her decisions have been formed in light of their practicing Stoicism as well as how Stoicism has impacted them emotionally in their everyday lives. By doing so I can then become better acquainted with the direct effects of the lives that Stoicism have shaped and use that information to better understand why I do what I do and how I can do those things better. \n', 1, '', 0, 0, 0, '', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', 1, 0, '', ''),

Hinton\r\n\r\nHello, my name is David Hinton and I was born on Altus Air Force Base, Oklahoma on April 6, 1964. My father was a career military man and I grew up in my early years with the influence of my father\'s military involvement in Vietnam.\r\n\r\nI am personally a retired Army Staff Sergeant with 23 years of service. I was retired because of an injury I received in Iraq on one of my three deployments to that conflict. Needless to say I spent most of my young adult life serving in the military under strict regimentation, discipline, and paying attention to detail. I also developed the values of integrity, courage, and commitment.\r\n\r\nI was first introduced to Stoicism through the Christian faith. In Christianity there was a lot of reference to a Greek word "Logos" meaning "reason","word", or "logic." Being the inquisitive type of person I am, I researched and read more about the Greek Philosophy in which the Christian religion borrowed the concept. During this research I would have read about Emperor Maximum Aurelius "Meditations" and other material on Zeno and other philosophers.\r\n\r\nI did attempt to study religion before I joined the Army but dropped out of college to enlist in the military in 1986. I was attending a conservative Christian college and I did not agree with what they were teaching me. I felt I would be living a "lie" so I joined the Army instead.\r\n\r\nMy second introduction back into Stoicism was when I became a Lay minister for the Episcopal Church in 2006. We had to study the history of the church and the philosophies that influence it and I was back with reading about Stoic Pantheism again. This time, the group I was studying with brought up the question of if Jesus of Nazareth may have been influenced by both Cynics from neighboring Greek cities and also Stoicism. The Master/disciple mode of teaching, the austere life style, and the teaching of the logos all suggested so. I came to the conclusion that the influences of Stoicism and Cyncism came as an after thought in the later writings about Jesus of Nazareth\'s life and ministry.\r\n\r\nMy third introduction to Stoicism came in 2011 after I returned back from my third tour in Iraq. I started to study Buddhism for its teachins on meditation and changing one\'s mental attitude into a positive mental state. Again, somewhere in the process I made a connection with Buddha\'s teachings and the teachings of the Stoics. I often wondered if some Buddhists missionaries actually made it to Greece or the Middle East but there is very little historical evidence of it. I do know I seen a parallel with the ethical teachings of Buddhism, Stoicism, and Christianity. Stoicism influenced Christianity but there is a big parallel between those two groups and with Buddhism.\r\n\r\nI consider myself a Pantheist and a Diest. I am not connected with any formal religion although I may attend either a Buddhist meditation centers or Christian church for socialization. I see the Universe itself as God and that the Universe somehow is a living, conscious, being with reason and self-awareness. I don\'t believe in anything outside the physical dimension of the Universe because I believe God and the Universe are all "one" and nothing more. I will admit this is still my subjective opinion and I won\'t be conceited enough to be dogmatic about my beliefs. We simply don\'t know one way or the other what is on the other side of death.\r\n\r\nI wanted to study Stoicism first of all for personal reasons: I am just plain interested in the subject. I do have other reasons I want the Certificate for completing the SES course.\r\n\r\nOne, I would like to honestly say that I am a Stoic of a real Philosophical society such as the one or organization represents. Again, I am not affiliated with any Christian church and I am not interested in doing so because I do not 100% agree with their creeds. On  the other hand, a real, existing, philosophy that applies to everyday life that has a group of likeminded people out there, that is appealing to me.\r\n\r\nTwo, I am interested in the Ordination of Stoic Philosopher. That certification carries the weight of a Christian clergyman or zen Buddhist priest or a humanist celebrant. I do already have a certificate of public celebrant from the World Pantheist Movement, but I appreciate the Stoical position a lot better. I always agreed with the ancient stoics but I wasn\'t aware of any organization that represented the philosophy until recently. This way I can become philosopher certified to perform the duties of a celebrant clergymen without having to compromise m integrity and become a Christian or Buddhist lay minister. I relate to stoicism a lot better.\r\n\r\nMy third reason for pursuing certification as a Ordained Stoical Philosophy is that I do have a sincere interest in becoming a chaplain or visiting clergyman at our Veterans Affairs hospitals. I am a disabled service connected veteran myself and I understand what veterans are going through. A lot of times they want someone to talk to about spiritual subjects but they are not "religious" or connected with any religious faith. I also believe that the tenants of Stoicism as well as the dynamics of Buddhist meditation could help a lot of the veterans who are suffering form Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder. I would like a chance to prove that it can help. I want a chance to use philosophy to help veterans in the role as a chaplain but do not want to compromise my integrity by having to become a Buddhist, or humanist celebrant. Buddhists are pantheistic but a lot of them are naturalist pantheists, meaning they see the universe as god but not a personal, reasoning God. Humanists are mostly atheists who don\'t believe in anything beyond human existence. Some of them may be naturalist pantheists but I am a dualist pantheist, whereas I believe in the Universe having a mind and conscious of its own.\r\n\r\nPlease strongly consider my application for the SES Ordained Stoic Philosopher course.

My daughter, who is twenty one, is Bipolar, and my son, who is twenty, has Autism and Epilepsy. The reason I mention these conditions is because of them, or rather I should say, owing to them, I was accidentally forced to seek the Stoic way of life. Because I am physically disabled, and have been so for many years, I can’t imagine raising these two children alone as I have witnessed other low income individuals doing, namely, participating in the race with the Joneses-always seeking the larger TV Flat screen, the newest video game systems, standing in lines on “Black Friday” and getting into fist-fights over other material goods…this way of life in America perplexes, angers, and saddens me, and I always taught my kids (even before I knew anything of formal Stoicism) that these were not the things one should aspire towards in life, and that in the end, we all die alone, and you can’t take any of it with you anyway.\nWe live on Acquidneck Island in Rhode Island, USA. Ours is a lovely little corner of the world indeed. We are separated from mainland Rhode Island by a long bridge, which has the unnerving habit of lightly swinging to the left and right when it is windy outside. I would not want to ever live anywhere else though, because for us, it is “the best of all possible worlds”, as the ever humorous Dr. Pangloss would say. \nI have been interested in Stoicism formally for about five years now, but informally (and accidentally) for decades already, initially via Mr. Spock of Star Trek, funny as that may sound. Early on, watching the series, Spock always appeared to me to be the smartest one of the bunch, and the funniest as well. He reminded me a lot of my Latvian grandmother, who raised me until I reached my teen years. She had arrived in America in 1950 right after WWII, and when I was removed from my mother’s care, I was given to my grandma. Oma (the word for grandma in Latvian) was a very no-nonsense lady, and the one teaching of hers I remember most is “never forget, everyone puts their pants on the same way-one leg at a time, because there just is no other way to do it.” By this she meant that, in the end, no one is “better” than me, simply due to financial, social, political, or any other status. Respect is earned, not automatically given and received simply due to one’s position in life, and this wisdom I carry with me daily through life, and have passed it on to my kids as well. \nHaving come from Latvia at the end of the war with nothing but the clothes on her back, Oma was a very frugal and practical lady, never bought restaurant food, or frozen food, or other junk, and cooked everything at home, and taught me to do so as well, and she ALWAYS said, “food is for nourishment, not for fun”, which, as we know, is at the very core of Stoic thought. As a child, I ate nothing that wasn’t home cooked, simple, and very nutritious, and, again, that was passed on to me, and now I cook that way for my children and myself as well, which is even more important for me now, that I have been diagnosed as a brittle diabetic. I really had nothing in my diet to change, having never been fond of sweets, or deep fried, or other unhealthy things. I simply had to adjust my relationship with the lowly potato, which I love at nearly every meal, but not so anymore. In that sense the Latvians are very much like the Irish-the potato is everywhere….\nBooks on Stoicism that I have read are the Enchiridiron, Marcus Aurelius’ “Meditations”, and a lot of articles at the SEP website, of which I am a member, on Stoicism and the leading Stoics. There is much more out there I want to read, but books are not always in my budget, and there is no library nearby that I can get to easily being disabled. \nI was raised Roman Catholic, but early on certain things seemed wrong to me, and then it all fell apart once I discovered Voltaire, whom I love to no end. I can say honestly that I do believe in a good and gracious God who did create myself and everything around me, I still pray “The Lord’s Prayer” every night as I go to sleep, but I do not pray anything “in the name of Jesus”, and when I have little talks with God in rough times, I call him God, and nothing else. I am familiar with the Bible, the Torah, the Koran, and I love Lao Tsu, the Tao Te Ching, and actually, were I to be forced to pick one text to serve as “scripture” for myself, it would certainly be either the Tao Te Ching or Voltaire’s Philosophical Encyclopedia. \nI have studied the Ancients a bit, I like reading Descartes, I love Voltaire, and I enjoy the study of Ethics, because to me it seems America is falling into a quagmire of no morals or ethics at all anymore, political correctness takes precedence over reason and honesty, and low income people like myself are most certainly not treated the same as everyone else is. I can’t begin to describe here the amount and extent of stereotyping that goes on once one is in the low income status in life. I literally have to PROVE, again and again that no, I am not a drug addict, or alcoholic, or ten other things JUST BECAUSE I carry a Medicaid card. For someone like myself, that was brought up on literature, classical music, and Latvian culture, this all is appalling and unacceptable to me, and I cringe whenever I see it happening to my kids. Whatever happened to “innocent until proven guilty”? \nI consider myself to be a Stoic in the works. I realise that there is much more for me to learn and absorb, but at the same time, I also realize that, even living the way I do now, i.e. not collecting material goods, not being envious of those who have more, being content with my particular place in life, and eating to live versus living to eat, makes me very different from many Americans, and I enjoy that. \nWhat I want to get from this course is that I want to turn into a big sponge and absorb as much as is humanly possible about this incredibly logical and awesome way of life. It is on my “bucket list” to be a “real” Stoic by the time I die. \n', 1, '', 0, 0, 0, '', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', 1, 0, '', ''),

How long you have been interested in Stoicism.\n\nI have been interested in Stoicism for some time (going back to my teenage years), which I understand to be originally attributed to the Ancient Greek philosopher, Zeno, he of ‘Zeno’s Paradox’ fame, or infamy, depending on your point of view (Wagstaff & Rowledge, 1995, p.181).\n\nThrough a general awareness of ancient philosophical ideas in the great European tradition (for example, extensive reading and note-taking concerning the writings of Cicero, Socrates, Aristotle, Plato and especially Marcus Aurelius), I have always had an awareness of some of the tenets of the Stoic school of thought, in particular, the importance of distinguishing between aspects of living and being that are in themselves virtuous, therefore possessing ‘equity-value’ (to use an Aristotleian idea), and those that are more of the nature of barter/appearances/extrinsic worth/emotional flux, reflecting the vagaries of life, therefore possessing ‘exchange-value’ if material in nature  (again, to use an Aristotleian idea), such aspects generally termed ‘indifferents’ by the Stoics. Additionally, I am very comfortable with the belief of Stoics in Providence and the governance of Nature at all times, from cradle to grave and beyond. Moreover, there is a sense in which I see Stoicism as being convergent with the notion of time being circular, therefore heightening the importance of not being emotionally overwhelmed by adversity or even tragedy. Regarding the research literature, there is one piece I read very recently that I believe chimes extremely well with the thoughts I have just outlined concerning the nature of Stoicism (Jones, 2010, p. 89). \n\nIn summing up, I have been both fascinated and inspired by a number of ideals associated with Stoicism since leaving secondary school in June 1986, some 29 years ago or so. I knew nothing about Stoic teaching when I was 16, but I had already developed a certain ‘stoicism’ of outlook, in the more commonly used sense of the word. This was a time of tremendous change and challenge for me, and I needed to quickly develop and augment effective strategies for both coping and thriving in the ever more complex ‘jungle’ that my world increasingly resembled. I will say more on this point later on (in part 7 of this essay). \n\n\n2. Any books you read on Stoic philosophy. If any, please list them.\n\nCicero, M. T. (1971). On the Good Life. Penguin UK.\nHammond, M. (2006). Marcus Aurelius: Meditations. Penguin UK.\n\n\n3. Would you call yourself an atheist, agnostic/skeptic, deist, theist?\n\nI would consider myself to be essential a theist, in that I believe that all things, whether temporal or ‘supernatural’ (in other words, everything that is, whether seen or unseen, within the universe), are sustained and indeed created by one Supreme or Ultimate Reality. I call this ultimate reality ‘God’. For me, God is the Heavenly Father, the Heavenly Mother, the Holy Spirit, and the Lord Jesus Christ. So my view is intensely personal and linked to Judaeo-Christian teachings, yet is neither strictly Jewish nor Christian. Currently, I prefer to think of myself as a private theist. For a significant part of my adult life, beginning in 2002 or so, but not since 2007 or thereabouts, I was a practicing and ‘devout’ Christian. Indeed, I was ostensibly raised by my mother and father with Christian principles in mind, although \n\nI did not have a living Christian faith until later on in my life as already mentioned. I am of course well aware of the Big Bang Theory, and the theory of natural selection. But I am yet to be persuaded of the case for the universe not having a governing and personal ‘First and Primary Cause’ or Supreme Creator (as I like to understand God) . I therefore stand resolutely with Albert Einstein who once famously said, “God does not play dice”. Having said this, I must stress that I now see my faith as a private witness to my God, and am sympathetic to other ideas concerning the underlying nature of spirituality (which, to my mind, must involve the ‘supernatural’ in some way, or at the very least shed light on the obvious mysteries of ‘life, the universe and everything’).\n\n\n4. Are you a member of a religious faith? If so, which and for how long?\n\nI am presently not a member of a religious faith, and have no intention to become a member of any religious faith at any point over the remainder of my life. (Having said this, please see my answer to the previous question, regarding my past and active involvement with the issue of religious faith). \n\n\n5. Have you studied philosophies other than Stoicism? If so, which?\n\nI have not formally studied any philosophy, in that I have never attended a Philosophy course. But, excluding Stoicism, I have read and cogitated on various readings concerning Foucault, Kant, Hegel, Wittgenstein (especially ‘On Certainty’), Aristotle, Plato, Socrates, Derrida and Heidigger (I am have pondered at length in the past on one of his most memorable questions, “what is ‘is’?”!), and so would say that I have a rudimentary grasp of phenomenology, epistemology, metaphysics, logic, ethics (especially business ethics), structuralism, post-structuralism and aesthetics.\n\n\n6. Do you consider yourself to be a Stoic?\n\nAt this point, I do not consider myself to be a Stoic, either in the completely definitive sense or in the essential (broader, but substantive) sense. And if I did, I would almost certainly have grave inner concerns about ‘pigeonholing’ myself in this way, especially as I do not want to be generally ‘extreme’ in any thing I do, including how I see myself. However, on points of principle, I am very happy to ‘pigeonhole’ myself, as I am a \'values-driven\' person at heart. \n\nRegarding the issue of ‘pigeonholing’, Plato certainly had something relevant to say: "But let him know how to choose the mean and avoid the extremes on either side, as far as possible, not only in this life, but in all that which is to come. For this is the way of happiness" (Republic, 10.619). \n\nHaving said this, I think that I am comfortable with the central themes of Stoicism as I understand them, and believe that learning more about Stoicism will make me more happy, rather than less happy (since I firmly believe that such further study will help me to generate, and more easily perpetuate, greater levels of inner harmony and balance). \n\nMy current understanding of Stoicism is especially shaped by the work of Marcus Aurelius with his wonderful ‘Meditations’. However, I know that there are other ways of living and doing Stoicism. Knowing more and more about these other views of Stoicism over time is likely to lead to regular and very much welcome reassessments of my position regarding Stoicism.\n\nNonetheless, in terms of the pain, frustration and alienation I felt around the time of leaving secondary school, magnified by protracted break-up of parent’s marriage during most of time at secondary school, I believe that this experience certainly help me to develop strong sympathies towards the Stoic tradition.\n\nMoreover, key experiences I have since then, running all the way up to the present (late February 2015) have had a profound effect on how I see the world and how I see myself. Going to Cambridge as a mature student, between October 1995 and June 1998, basically changed my life profoundly for the better, and is certainly the most important thing I did up until the age of 30. In the first decade of the 20th century, the most important thing I did was to ‘fall’ into Christian faith – for five years. For some people, this might appear to be a very short period of time. But, for me, it was the second most important experience of my life up until that point, the first being my ‘baptism of fire’ and eventual academic success at Cambridge University the previous decade (through a great deal of perseverance, a considerable and increasing work ethic, and a sufficient modicum of talent, in my humble and considered opinion). \n\nLast year, I was promoted to Deputy Headmaster of the secondary school I am currently based at in a port city by the name of Qingdao, in northern China. This is the third most important experience of my life so far (not counting getting married in July 2012). \n\nIn general, I have not enjoyed working as a senior teacher, but am determined to ‘push the boat out as far as I can’, with a view to making as big a positive difference as I can, and shoring up the prospects of oneself become Headteacher in the near term (next three years). In this, I am minded of one of Marcus Aurelius’s most memorable comments in his Meditations: “The impediment to action advances action. What stands in the way becomes the way.” (Meditations, Book 5, Passage 20)\n\nFurthermore, I also see myself as generally having cautiously conservative leanings (Rescher, 2015, p. 442). I am particularly sympathetic to the ideas and thinking of Roger Scruton, a maverick conservative philosopher, somewhat humorously ‘quizzed’ recently by Jonathan Derbyshire recently in the New Statesman (Derbyshire, 2012, p. 43).\n\nCrucially, I have had a difficult time in general, since arriving in China very recently, mainly on account of major culture shock, despite having reached a career high in terms of seniority and responsibility. Yet, despite the difficulties, I have resolved to solder on. In this regard, now married to a Chinese lady, I have greater incentives to keep on fighting, but it is above all a personal struggle. Despite a number of ‘episodes’ of discomforting ambiguity and lack of clarity experienced in my life since the beginning of 2015, whether in my personal or professional life, and associated emotional tension regarding my general existential situation, I believe that things will become better in the near future. \n\nThis is not necessarily because I think that something wonderful and good will happen, in addition to all the good things I already have, which I readily acknowledge when my mind is on ‘good form’. More importantly, it is because I want to change how I relate to my problems and challenges, some of which are actively welcomed, rather than simply resented (especially where I have identified them as being directly concerning with my continued self-mastery and self-improvement). \n\nI want to become more ‘immune’ to life’s vicissitudes and less ‘blown around’, emotionally. I believe that this is what much of Marcus Aurelius’ writings are getting at. But I also believe that he wanted to develop an ever more kindly and genuinely caring heart, and disposition to attend to the needs of his fellow citizens (and it is clear from his writings that this is something he struggled with, throughout his distinguished career as Emperor, all the way to the end of his life). \nIn my way, in still wanting to make a difference at my current employer, especially in terms of enhancing standards of discipline and industry across the school, I want to be less emotionally sensitive in some ways. \n\nBut I also want to maintain and enhance the warmth of my heart for the people I am around; I do not want my heart to become cold or ‘stonelike’ in a sense. Indeed, I wholeheartedly agree with Marcus Aurelius, who surely hints in his Meditations at the strong link between living and wrestling, especially for leaders (Hopen, 2014, p.3). This is because I constantly recognise that in my work as a senior teacher, I am often wrestling with ill-defined, long-standing and essentially systemic issues, sometimes called ‘wicked problems’ in modern-day parlance. \n\nSo, in summing up, I think that I have some things in common with Marcus Aurelius and general Stoic teachings, as I currently understand them, in terms of one’s current and longstanding approach to life and living. I would certainly say that I am very sympathetic to, and resonant with, Stoic teachings.\n\n\n7. What you want to get from this course.\n\nFirstly, I expect to be even more fascinated and inspired by what I learn and meditate upon, as I progress successfully through the SES course. \n\nSecondly, I want to be thoroughly prepared for the next stage of my ‘advanced immersion’ into the theory and practice of Stoicism. Assuming I complete the SES, I hope to go on to the MA School 1-year programme and ultimately become a Fellow of the College of Stoic Philosophers. I would love to share what I have learnt about Stoicism and any relevant life experiences I have, as a Mentor, with people who wish to undertake the SES course in the future.\n\nThirdly, I expect to continue working as a senior teacher and leader for the foreseeable future, and hope that my significantly deepened and ever-deepening commitment to Stoicism will help me to be a better professional and care-giver, both to students and to staff.\n\nLastly, as already indicated, I am married, but am relatively new to its challenges (although my wife and I are fast approaching celebrating our third anniversary).  I trust that I will become an even more loving, supportive and responsible husband, through paying even closer attention to the focused exhortations and continuous changes of heart required to more deeply live out Stoic ideals, complementing my Theist world-view (broadly, but not exclusive, Christian). \n\nI commend, and am greatly encouraged by people of all faiths, where it is clear to me that they are living a ‘good life’, through how they conduct themselves and the things they place significant value upon, whether in their private or public lives.\n\n\nReferences:\n\nCross, R.

As part of a survey of Western ideas, we read a slender volume of selections from Epictetus\' Encheiridion (trans. N. P. White).  It was then that I first encountered Stoic philosophy; I think I even wrote one of my seminar papers contrasting Stoic and Epicurean attitudes toward death.\r\n\r\nBut only within the last two years have I considered adopting Stoicism as a practical philosophy of life: the result of a confluence of experiences that stretch further back in my life.  A few years ago, before the birth of my first child, my former neighbor gave me some advice which immediately took root in my mind: “Attend to your children’s spiritual life.”  For an avowed atheist, the statement puzzled me, but as I began to examine my life, I realized that something was missing.  My colleagues, many of whom are religious Christians, have a framework for understanding the world and dealing with life’s tragedies.  For example, I have heard—countless times—the saying “I’ll pray for you.”  I could never utter these words because prayer is not part of my beliefs.  (I might offer “We’re thinking of you.”)  Nonetheless, I feel inadequate and awkward whenever a friend suffers hardship.  I wish I could say more, do more.  At the same time and for many years, I have been struggling with my own “thin skin.”  Things seem to affect me, move my emotions here and there, and my typical recourse is not helpful: I dwell in the negative energy.  Three years ago, I remember stopping myself before entering my house and demanding that I not bring the “bad” energy past the threshold to spare my wife and infant daughter.  It worked for a few hours.  \r\n\r\nTaken together, I have recognized that I need grounding, centering, and the resultant peace, and I find kinship with Stoicism the more I read and learn about it.  For example, the first sentence of Epictetus has been useful to me.  Whenever I feel hasty or impatient (at a traffic light or in a line at the grocery store), I simply state the words: “Some things are in our control and others not.”  Then I can regain focus and my anxiety subsides.  My interests have heightened over the years, especially with the discovery of the University of Exeter’s blog and Massimo Pigliucci’s blog, which brought me to your website.\r\n\r\n(2) In addition to Epictetus, I have read and re-read tracts of Aurelius\' Meditations (trans. G. Hays), Seneca\'s Letters from a Stoic (trans. R. Campbell), and most of Irvine\'s The Art of Stoic Joy.  I also read more recently a delightful history by James Romm entitled Dying Every Day: Seneca at the Court of Nero.  That being said, I crave systematicity (a byproduct of my university education): a scope and sequence of study, balanced with a partnership that brings accountable.  \r\n\r\n(3) I am an atheist, or I might say that science is my religion (knowing full well that science requires much faith).\r\n\r\n(4) I am not a member of any faith.  Most of my grandparents were Jewish except my maternal grandmother who was Catholic.  My mother is a new age spiritualist, and my father has rediscovered his Jewish roots since their divorce (a long time ago):  he recently completed his 7-year study of the Talmud.  When I asked him what he would do next, he replied: “Start again from the beginning.”  Personally, I never felt a resonance with Judaism.  I remember my early years in Sunday school at the local synagogue; I enjoyed the stories, songs, and friends.  (I was always good at school—a quick learner.)  But I didn’t believe any of it, any of the metaphysics.  If there is a God gene, the switch in my DNA has yet to be activated.  In college, I studied philosophy and took a few courses in Hinduism and Buddhism.  Interestingly, the greatest kinship I\'ve felt with any established faith or “wisdom tradition” is Buddhism.  Its non-theism coupled with its twin foci of nonattachment and compassion seem right to me.  Thus, if I had to attend a holy space, I imagine myself going to a Zen center.  Of course, Buddhism and Stoicism have much in common.\r\n\r\n(5) I majored in philosophy and earned two Masters degrees: the first in Liberal Studies and the second in Philosophy and Education.  Thus, I have had broad exposure to the history of Western philosophy.  As an undergrad, I studied the pre-Socratics, the Greeks, Hellenistic philosophy, the Medieval tradition, the Enlightenment thinkers, and all the major writers of the 18th, 19th and 20th centuries (Hume, Kant, Kierkegaard, Hegel, Nietzsche, Marx, Freud, Husserl, Heidegger, Sartre, etc.).  My only real deficits are the Early Modern thinkers and Logical Positivism of which I know next to nothing.  In my first grad school experience, I focused on Nietzsche but ultimately wrote my thesis about the German cultural critic Walter Benjamin’s early philosophy of language in relation to his style of immanent critique.  My second grad school experience centered largely on Dewey’s pragmatism, Paulo Freire’s critical pedagogy, and Nel Noddings’ care ethics.  My thesis, there, was on the role of the imagination in the ethics of care—a response to the late philosopher of education Maxine Greene’s imperative to develop the moral imagination of our students.\r\n\r\n(6) I am not a Stoic by any means, but I want to explore Stoicism and possibly adopt it as a mode of being.  The Stoic virtues, like prosoche, are ones I hope to cultivate.  \r\n\r\n(7) In short, I am looking for ways to bring calm and stillness to my inner life, and consequently transform my interactions with my family, students and colleagues.  Thus, on the one hand, I am doing this for myself, yet I feel strongly that my personal relationships will improve and that my children, who necessarily view me as their moral exemplar and role model, will benefit enormously.  Attending to their spiritual lives demands that I attend to my own: whence my decision to apply to your four-month course.  I believe that a formal course, with its structure and assignments, will guide me into a practice that I might otherwise continuously put off.  I especially like the Mentor/mentee structure of SES; having that relationship will no doubt place good, productive external pressures on me.  \r\n', 1, '', 1, 0, 0, '', 0, '', 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 'Adam earned his B.A. (Philosophy), M.A. (Liberal Studies), and Ed.M.

Training horses has been my family’s business since my Grandfather returned from fighting in France and Germany during the Second World War. We moved to Florida when I was quite young, and that is where I grew up.\nAbout twelve years ago, when I was on the cusp of my teenage years, my father gave me a copy of George Long’s translation of Epictetus’ Enchiridion, with a note in the front: “Maybe read this one day.” I was rather young at the time, so I did not really think much of it. It stood on my shelf for several years, unread. A few years later, probably nine to ten years ago, I resolved to read whatever books I owned that I had not read. It is then that I was first exposed to stoicism. I read through the Enchiridion. Then I read through it again, and again. I was fascinated by Epictetus’ ethics and his solutions for living a life of virtue, although at the time I did not understand or perhaps could not connect with his metaphysical systems. \n	Epictetus certainly kindled my burgeoning interest in stoicism. But I did not explore it further than the Enchiridion until I reached university. When I had access to a decently stocked university library, so came a greater blossoming of my exploration of stoicism. After reading the Discourses of Epictetus, then I moved to Marcus Aurelius. The first time I read Meditations, my interest compelled a flurry of reading, finishing the book in perhaps a week. In subsequent readings, I prefer to read it slowly, lingering on his thoughts. I have also read the relevant sections of Diogenes Laertius’ Lives of the Eminent Philosophers that deal with the early stoics. Apart from those stoic classics, I have also studied Spinoza’s Ethics, which I see connecting greatly to stoic philosophy. Spinoza’s panentheism, as well as his ethical system, draw deeply from the stoic well. \n	As far as my understanding of the divine, I am a theist. Around the same time that I began more seriously exploring stoicism, I was also connecting seriously with my Christian faith for the first time, and finding rich intersections among the trajectories of Christianity and stoicism. I have been attending Lutheran church for the last four years, and am currently employed as a missionary-teacher in Eastern Europe. One part of my job entails teaching advanced English conversation and writing, the other part is teaching a Christian lifestyle and virtue. In this I am certainly informed by stoicism. \n	I have studied other philosophies, as much of my undergraduate work was in philosophy. I have mostly done work within “analytical” philosophy, particularly formal logic, philosophy of language, and philosophy of mind. My particular focus was on Wittgenstein and the therapeutic use of philosophy. However, I also completed coursework on modern theories of virtue, such as that revived by G.E.M. Anscombe and further expounded by Robert Merrihew Adams, Alasdair McIntyre and Alfred Mele. In that coursework, I was particularly troubled by the notion of self-deception, which appears incidentally in both Wittgenstein and in ethical systems of virtue, as well as poses some problems to stoic introspection. \nApart from my coursework, I have also studied theological-philosophical systems. In this area, I have bumped up against quite a bit of neoplatonism (such as Augustine, pseudo-Dionysus and Bonaventure) and neoaristotelianism (Avicenna, Averroes and Thomas Aquinas) in the Christian and Islamic contexts. I am also familiar with Protestant theology, from Martin Luther to more modern theologians such as Karl Barth, Dietrich Bonhoeffer and Paul Tillich. \nIn studying Christianity theology, I have found many points of rich dialogue with stoicism. The study of Christian theology lends itself well to the study of Roman stoicism, especially with my recent studies in Koine Greek. I find that the Johannine understanding of ὀ λόγος finds common resonance with the stoic notion of the same. In stoicism, ὀ λόγος describes the active ordering principles underlying the universe, the animating and organizing power with which the sage is advised to accord his or her will; just as ὀ λόγος orders speech in the mind, so ὀ λόγος orders the matter of the universe. In Christianity, Jesus is identified as the λόγος, preexisting “with” and “as” God at the creation of the universe.\nWhen I began my employment as a missionary overseas, I only had a small amount of room in my bags for books. The three books I chose were the Bible, Epictetus’ Enchiridion, and Wittgenstein’s Philosophical Investigations. The copy of Enchiridion with me here is the same that I was given by my father so many years ago, and contains five or six strata of my own marginal notes from its recurrent and regular readings.    \nI’m not sure if I consider myself a stoic. I have a deep suspicion for notions of moral perfection, or notions of perfect virtue. I certainly don’t see myself as successful at being anything near what Epictetus or Aurelius describe as a stoic sage. I know myself to be at times immoderate, impassioned and unmindful. But I see my engagement with stoicism as a process, as a corrective and anchor against my impulses, my emotional passions, and my temptations towards vice. It helps hone my mental states, calm my anxieties, and fortify my perseverance. Stoic practices have helped me deal with disappointment in my career endeavors, control bad habits (having quit smoking), and grieve the dead. \nTraining horses and stoicism have also informed each other greatly in my experience. Horses are extremely emotional creatures, and as herd animals, they are acutely sensitive to the emotional patterns of other animals. So if the animal panics, it looks to others to either confirm its panic, or assuage it. The horse can feel the minute movements of one’s muscles, as well as the vibrations of one’s bones and sinews in the legs and hips, enough to tell when the rider’s head is turned to look at something—even without seeing him turn his head. It is no surprise, then, that they can also feel one’s heartbeat and the surge of blood vessels through the legs. If the rider’s heart is beating quickly in his own state of panic, and if his emotions get the better of him, the horse will panic further. This causes a feedback loop of panic that will likely end in injury. So stoic training has allowed me to be calm in the face of panic, to take control of the situation, and project and attitude of tranquility to comfort the animal and prevent it from panicking further. Likewise, training horses has given me an unprecedented level of practice in applying stoic training to situations of actual crisis. \nWhat I would like from the course is a structured, rigorous environment to explore stoicism even more deeply. In particular, I am intrigued by the notion of a mentored setting for studying stoicism. As Arrian learned from Epictetus, and Epictetus from Musonius Rufus, this has long been the model for stoic learning. Second, I would like to explore some of the philosophical challenges I find in stoicism. In particular, I am interested in the situation of emotion or “the passions” with respect to control of the will, and the challenge to stoic introspection posed by self-deception. Finally, I desire more practical methods to apply stoicism to daily life.\n', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, '', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', 1, 0, '', '');

It sets the bar at just about the right place.  Children may not have the bloodlust of the second century’s marauding Germans, menacing the Roman Empire on its northern frontier, but a child’s inclination to combat and opposition is powerfully ingrained.  We are all born barbarians.  \n\nAnd barbarians we may well remain without a potent corrective.  Whether the philosophy of Marcus Aurelius is the right prescription for myself and perhaps my family is a matter about which I am not yet entirely certain.  It’s said the son learns from the father, and Commodus, I confess, gives me pause.  At various points over the last decade I have given some thought to other sources of wisdom: secular humanism, Buddhism, virtue ethics, positive psychology, logotherapy, alcohol, communitarianism and the Christianity of my childhood.  Alcohol and Christianity are the only two options I have more or less ruled out (I hope).   Yet as I have drifted further and further from the theistic roots of my upbringing (Episcopal Church roots to be sure, so not too deep), the need for some clear guidance on how best to live, some comprehensive ethical system, has grown correspondingly stronger.  Lately I have found myself looking to Stoicism for a possible answer.  \n\nI grew up in Richmond, Virginia and graduated from Princeton University in 1991 with a BA in beer history.  I had not been an especially curious or ambitious student – only some good hoop-jumping got me into Princeton in the first place – and a great stretch of floundering and futility and unfulfilled promised followed graduation, about which I would rather not reminisce.  At 35, back in Richmond, I married and had my first child, and it is from that time that I date my adult life.  Maturity doesn’t come overnight of course, never mind wisdom, but I took to my role as father with great seriousness of purpose and began educating myself about what and how a good father should be.  I turned first to the church for direction.   \n\nI was raised in the Episcopal Church and was a regular church-goer through high school (K-12 at an Episcopalian private school), but I was never particularly pious and dropped the church altogether once I went to college.  Becoming parents prompted my wife and I to revisit our non-religious orientation, and our three children were baptized in the Episcopal Church, in a religion-for-atheists kind of way; but despite our respect for the beauty and moral clarity of the church (in this liberal, ecumenical incarnation), my wife and I found ourselves unable to tolerate the stubborn emphasis on the supernatural.  We were eager to bathe our children (and ourselves) in a culture of high ethical standards and norms, to be part of a community that would persistently appeal to and encourage the development of the better angels of our nature; but the church we experienced was mostly preoccupied with the promise of the hereafter.  Lacking this kind of belief, which it seemed most of our fellow church-goers possessed to one degree or another, and eager for a moral code independent of the supernatural, it felt both disingenuous and pointless to participate.\n\nSo we were off on our own, reinventing the wheel of life.  The guidance provided by popular culture was not especially edifying, but it did lead me to take a more critical look at modern life.  The writings of Neil Postman had a powerful influence on me, and led, belatedly, as our first child approached kindergarten, to an examination of how we are educating our children (and to what purpose).  All of this was (and is) quite amateurish and superficial, but I was sufficiently alarmed to propose homeschooling, as an experiment in providing our child a more solid academic foundation than she might get otherwise.  At the same time, it was beginning to dawn on me, at last, how feeble my own education had been, how wanting.  I knew a little about a lot but had learned nothing of importance to any depth.  I had (have) no understanding.  The garnish of Ivy could not disguise a dish lacking in all substance.\n\nThus my educational odyssey began, a journey – I still have hardly left the shore – across the vast ocean of my own ignorance.  While trying to educate my own daughter (and our second child joined the homeschool project two years later), I was simultaneously trying to educate myself.  Needless to say this latter endeavor has been fantastically quixotic: a man who begins his education at 40 is not destined to be particularly well educated.  Our heads at 40 are cluttered with much useless junk, which is not so simple to discard; and the mind past 40, or mine anyway, is like a sieve.  Plus there is so little time.  The demands of raising a family and the day-to-day chaos and commitments of adult life do not permit a life of study and contemplation.  Six years of self-study have left me only more confused.\nBut we press on nevertheless.  I read all I can, whenever I can, and hope that it will somehow all cohere.  This is my new faith, and my children – now ages 11, 9 and 4 – keep me desperate for it.  These lively creatures, sometimes noble but still mostly savage, my greatest source of happiness (and vexation), have made me hungry to learn, to understand, to gain possession of some molecule of wisdom I can pass on to them.  The responsibility of educating them has forced me to continually evaluate – and re-evaluate – what education means and what it is for.  This dense philosophical thicket I have not really begun to penetrate of course, but a survey of its contours has led me to some very basic philosophical questions.  What is the purpose of life?  What is the good life?  What is wisdom?  How should we live?\nModern philosophy has almost nothing comprehensible to say about any of these questions, so it was to the Ancients I turned – Socrates, Plato and Aristotle, Confucius, the Buddha, Jesus.  My readings here have been maddeningly unsystematic and haphazard and thus ultimately confusing.  In search of clarity, or at least simplicity, I have not infrequently sought solace in the modern day literature of self-help.  Such comfort food is rarely sustaining, but it did lead me, several years ago, to William Irvine’s "A Guide to the Good Life" and my formal introduction to Stoicism. \n\nThe "Meditations" and "Enchiridion" followed quickly enough, but I was far from converted.  Irvine’s book had left a sour taste in my mouth – it proposed, to my eyes, such a narrow and self-centered view of what a modern interpretation of Stoicism might look like – and I soon lost interest.  Certainly my reading was colored by the popular (mis)conception of Stoicism as a cold and joyless enterprise; but this “neo-Stoicism” also felt somewhat contrived and inauthentic, though I suppose no more objectionable than a westerner of European heritage taking up the practice of Zen Buddhism (another passing interest).\n\nThen, in February, I came across an opinion piece in the The New York Times by Massimo Pigliucci, a philosopher/scientist I was familiar with in other contexts, in which he outlined his own ongoing experiment with Stoicism .  (A more recent blog post of his directed me to this course.)  Pigliucci’s interest in Stoicism rekindled my own curiosity.  I re-read Irvine’s book (in the depths of winter his exclusive emphasis on personal tranquility seemed significantly less unappealing), read Paul Johnson’s short biography on Socrates, A.A. Long’s "Epictetus," Donald Robertson’s "Stoicism and the Art of Happiness" (which I prefer to Irvine’s book), and familiarized myself with the Stoic Week literature online.  My (enormous) stack of yet-to-be-read books includes works by Seneca, Epictetus, and Musonius Rufus.\n\nReading can only take one so far of course.  With any system of ethics it is the daily doing that really counts, and here I am very much still trying to figure things out.  While I am especially drawn to Stoicism’s emphasis on self-discipline, mindfulness, and practice, the ideal of the Stoic sage seems far out of reach.  So I do not yet consider myself a Stoic.  But I do consider myself to be a prospective Stoic, perhaps even an apprentice Stoic, and I’m hopeful this course will help me take the next step.  Mostly I’m hopeful that this course will get me closer to the answer of the essential question: How best to live.  \n\nOr at least that other one: How best to endure one’s children.   \n\nFate permitting, I guess.\n', 1, '', 0, 0, 0, '', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', 1, 0, '', ''),

Still, I have seen significant success and setbacks in so short a period of time. My family was on food stamps for part of my childhood, yet I studied at a prestigious university. After college, I took a job at another prestigious university, but also watched my apartment burn down, and spent eight months on chemotherapy to treat a genetic skin disorder. It’s been a life of highs and lows. In early 2013, I began seeking concrete methodologies for combating these variations in fortune. I have a rather biased sample set, but my experience indicates that life is a turbulent experience. Due to my longstanding interest in philosophy, and my emerging interest in neuroscience, I find that Stoicism (and Buddhism) are the best candidates for meeting the challenge of the human experience. I see extensive overlap between the two systems. Due to my professional training as a classicist, my Stoic inclinations are stronger than my Buddhist inclinations, though if I were Seneca, the Buddha would be my Epicurus. I feel these systems will be of intense interest to humanity worldwide as traditional religious interest declines and the border between the human and artificial intelligence fades.\n\nAcquaintance with Stoicism\nI have been aware of the Stoics for about six years, and convinced of their value for about one year. Previously, I had been hesitant about Stoicism because I took their general cultural neglect as a cue for their obsolescence. I was mistaken. I have slowly come to realize that many features of the Stoic mindset and many well-designed Stoic practices for mental equanimity had been devoured by more popular systems like Christianity.  \n\nAcquaintance with Stoic Texts\nI have read various pieces of Seneca in Latin and English. I have read Aurelius in English and parts of the work in Greek. I have read only part of Epictetus in English. I have read numerous third-party analyses of Stoicism, including Holowchak’s ‘The Stoics’ and Inwood’s ‘The Stoics Reader.’ I have not yet read Sellars. \n\nReligious Identity\nI don’t feel I fit neatly into any of these belief-types. Even if I were to label myself an agnostic, I see a common (perhaps universal) human interest in assigning divinity and order to the broader framework of consciousness and reality, so I don’t feel comfortable wearing the skin of an agnostic. Agnostics seem content to stop thinking about the God problem. I passionately want a solution to the God problem, not a suspension of belief. I don’t believe I can have a solution, given our species’ current scientific data on the topic, but I look forward to the emergence of greater statistic probability for or against a cosmological order as we advance in time and give greater responsibility to computation intelligence. (I do not feel an anthropomorphic God is a logical or reasonable belief.) Science suggests a ruling set of principles, not a ruling mind. Any mind is a function of these principles, of the algorithms within the universe—not vice versa. \n\nReligious Practice\nI am not a member of religious faith. I have respect for Buddhism and pity for adherents of Christianity, Islam, and Judaism. I have not given much thought to Hinduism.\n\nAcquaintance with Philosophy\nI have read extensively in the field of philosophy. I was reading Descartes and Marx at 16. I read the entirely of Copleston’s History of Philosophy (7 volumes, 2,500 pages) during my senior year of high school. I have read all of Plato and Aristotle, much of Plato in Greek. \n\nStoic Identity\nI consider myself a Stoic, yes.\n\nStatement of Intent\nI would like a deeper understanding of Stoicism for the purposes of supporting my incoming role as Secretary of the New Stoa board, and with the hope of building new tools and resources for Stoics online. My primary interest is in building a Stoic youtube channel (currently lacking), casting myself as the central character in the videos. To become this personality, I feel I should have my views and education vetted by more seasoned Stoics. I would prefer a mentor with some interest in Greek and Latin, though this is not a requirement. I hope to read the assigned text in the original and in translation. \n\nAdditional Paragraph\nThis paragraph is being added to aid my goal of meeting the 1,000 word limit. I am a student of brevity, but will do my best. My vision for the Stoic youtube channel is one which strongly integrates with active Youtube culture (that is, imitates the kinds of videos, especially motivational videos, already on Youtube) without diluting the content of Stoic philosophy. The channel would address Stoic perspectives on common modern problems like weight loss, relationship issues, addiction, body dysmorphia, poverty, racial and gender imbalances, economic crises, or various features of the approaching 2016 presidential election, but would rely on standard Stoic principles to direct its content. At present, there is a popular influx of interest in Stoic philosophy, but no clear leader for this surge in interest, and no clear use for the philosophy. I would like to stabilize the Stoic presence online by integrating Stoic principles with similar movements. To be sure, I want Stoicism to dilute mindfulness, and not vice versa. I believe Stoicism is a genuinely complete system of human behavior with the capacity to remedy many chronic social ills of modern civilization. We need to show clearly that it has a well-defined voice for our age. Interestingly, the apex of Stoic civilization during the period of the Five Good Emperors suggests to me an important use of Stoicism during periods of mixed prosperity. Stoicism is build for ‘hard times’ during ‘great eras’ of human history. Stoicism did not survive the Dark Ages, but I dream that it may prevent a sequel. \n\nI should emphasize that I consider myself a \'consciousness in development,\' and maintain a healthy sense of skepticism about my own values, goals and judgments. Individuals change a little every day. I consider Stoicism a sturdy moral infrastructure, but ultimately all individuals evolve their ethical code to meet the boundaries of their lot. \n', 1, '', 0, 0, 0, '', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', 1, 0, '', ''),

I have one adult child from an earlier marriage, and am raising two children together with my current wife.  I was born and raised in the Dayton, Ohio area.  \n\nI’ve been peripherally aware of Stoicism and its relation to Cognitive Behavioral Therapy since preparing a lecture for Family Medicine residents about CBT in 2006.  Unlike many of my other colleagues in the Cleveland area, who seemed to be very psychodynamic oriented, I’ve had a strong affinity for CBT, and the use of reason to overcome emotional problems.  I’ve had mixed results using CBT in my own life with my own problems, and I’ve been more successful using elements of Stoicism.  I believe that the difference in results is because CBT, as a psychotherapy, does not recommend any goals in life.  It instead seems to be reactionary in response to emotional problems.  \n\nIt wasn’t until I heard someone speak about Stoicism at the Porcupine Freedom Festival in New Hampshire in 2014 that I was motivated to look into it in any detail.  I’ve since become more interested, and have read a number of books, by modern and ancient authors, but I know that I still have much to learn.  I’ve seen positive effects from trying to live as a Stoic in my marriage, career, and as a father.  \n\nThe books that I’ve read, and completed, that relate to Stoicism include:\n1.	A Guide to the Good Life: The Ancient Art of Stoic Joy, by William Irvine\n2.	The Epictetus Club: Lessons from the Walls, by Jeff Traylor\n3.	Meditations, by Marcus Aurelius, translated by C R Haines\n4.	Meditations, by Marcus Aurelius, translated by George Long\n5.	The Obstacle is the Way: The Timeless Art of Turning Trials into Triumph, by Ryan Holliday\n6.	The Art of Living: The Classical Manual on Virtue, Happiness and Effectiveness, by Sharon Lebell\n7.	Musonius Rufus: Lectures and Sayings, translated by Cynthia King\n8.	The Wisdom of the Stoics: Selections from Seneca, Epictetus and Marcus Aurelius, by Frances and Henry Hazlitt\n\nI’ll also finish reading Hellenistic Philosophy: Stoics, Epicureans, Sceptics; Second Edition, by A A Long in the near future.  I’ve also dabbled in the Discourses of Epictetus and Seneca’s Letters, but I don’t think I can honestly say that I’ve read more than a third of the material in either of them, yet.  \n\nI was raised in a Greek Orthodox household.  In the past few years I’ve become a skeptic/atheist, but more recently I am leaning towards being a Stoically oriented deist.  \n\nI’ve made minimal investigations into Epicureanism, Skepticism and Cynicism, mostly to further my understanding of Stoicism, and to understand some of the references in the original Stoic writings.  I’d also like to learn some more about Taoism.  \n\nFor some time, I’ve considered myself to be, and have referred to myself to be, a fledgling Stoic.  It will likely be quite some time before I will confidently say that I am more than that.  \n\nAt the very least, I want to take this course to further my understanding of Stoicism.  Ultimately, I plan to complete the Marcus Aurelius School’s program, and the program through the Chrysippus School of Theology to become an Ordained Stoic Philosopher.  I’ve become somewhat disillusioned with my career as a psychiatrist, for a number of reasons.  The majority of my practice, especially in my current practice setting, is in psychopharmacology, or medication management.  While I think there is a role for medication management, I do believe that it is somewhat over-utilized in this country.  I could, potentially, go against the grain and attempt to establish a psychotherapy practice.  However, part of my disillusionment with my career is based on the ongoing/increasing bureaucratization of medicine, and how it is becoming ever more entangled with insurance companies and various levels of government.   At the end of the day, I want to be responsible to my patients, and to my own moral conscience.  Interference from outside organizations, in my experience, gets in the way, and incentivizes putting the needs of the patient, or of my need to adhere to my moral conscience, behind the demands of the third party.  \n\nMy hope, which is admittedly an ambitious one, is that being an Ordained Stoic Philosopher will enable me to establish my own “healing place for sick souls”.  I’ve only recently become aware of the existence of such a thing as a Philosophical Practitioner, but I find the prospect to be exciting and promising.  I think that working as a Philosophical Practitioner will be better suited to my nature, than working as a psychiatrist in the current medical environment.  I currently spend too much time checking off symptoms on a list, and assigning patients semi-arbitrary diagnoses that have little to do with their root problems, or with the potential solutions to their problems.  \n\nOn a slightly less serious note, I have been a fan of Robert Heinlein’s science fiction novels since I was a child.  While it has been some years since I’ve reread any of his works, I’m convinced that he’s had some Stoic influences.  In Citizen of the Galaxy, a young slave is purchased and freed by a crippled beggar, who teaches him, among other things, that a wise man can never be insulted, because an intended insult is either the truth, which cannot be insulting, or a fiction, which is irrelevant.  In Stranger In A Strange Land a human who was raised from infancy by Martians puts great emphasis on never hurrying, but instead emphasizing being careful to analyze situations in order to be able to “act rightly.” He is also able to sustain grievous injuries without any emotional response, which occurs after he opens a school, in the guise of a church, to teach Martian logic to people on Earth.  These things could all be coincidences, and there may be a degree of cultural archetypes at play that I’m over-interpreting as evidence of Stoic influence, but I’d like to go back and reread some of his works after developing a more thorough background in Stoicism to see if my theory has any merit.  \n', 1, '', 0, 0, 0, '', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', 0, 0, '', ''),

I say semi retired as I have not worked since Christmas and was hospitalised in January with back problems. These have left me less physically able than I once was. For a time my mental faculties were effected by the prescription drugs I was taking. Lately I have been weaning myself off of them and I am now getting back full cognitive function. Well, full cognitive function for a 55 year old which unfortunately is as good as it will get I suspect.\n \nI have an engineering degree, an arts degree and a Masters in Management with particular interest in leadership. I started a part time PhD with UCL but dropped out as I could see my dissertation \'falling dead from the press\' or whatever the David Hume comment was. The idea of spending 7 or 8 years researching some thing to prove the answer I already knew filled me with depression and I chose to take another path.\n \nI have been reading philosophy most of my life but very randomly. I am familiar with the greats but not clear on who said what or what "school" they fall into other than the obvious ones.... I have started reading John Sellers on Stoicism and I am aware of people like Cicero and Epicurus and bits of the letters of Epicurus but I\'m not going to pretend I am sure which early philosophers are Stoics. I am not aware of any modern/current Stoics.\n \nI have been downloading various syllabuses (syllabi?) and using them to try to give me some sort of framework to my learning but I still follow a breadcrumb of interest too far and struggle to find the path back. Do I "study" chronologically? By belief or theme? Ethics/metaphysics? Do I pick someone e.g Plato and read everything examining his work... I really don\'t know what is best and I feel that the random reading is making it more difficult to get the ideas sorted in my head.\n \nI have studied philosophy via a MOOC with the University of Edinburgh which I enjoyed but it was very brief. I have followed a YouTube course by Mark Thorsby and have learned a lot - I now understand the analogy of the cave and the five ways of Aquinas. But again this has all whetted my appetite to learn "properly" and the Stoics have always intrigued me.\n \n \nStudying is a kind of addiction to me and I really enjoy it. I read voraciously including "trash" fiction - crime and thrillers etc - and nonfiction. I enjoy reading psychology and true crime as why people do things interests me. But more and more I find myself searching further for I know not what. I have looked at some self help type books - the purpose driven life etc., - but again I don\'t find it fulfilling my need to know more. More about the reason things are the way they are and whether there is any way to change that. Hoping that even makes sense...\n \nKnowing thyself is always difficult. As Robert Burns said "oh what a gift the giftie gie us, to see ourselves as others see us". I see myself as educated, intelligent, empathetic and striving. I ran my own company for four years (currently closing it down) having reached Director level in the NHS in the UK. I would like to work again and I am looking at part time non- executive roles or volunteer work to see if I can find a way to keep busy and if possible earning a bit of money.\n \nI have a life partner and we have been together 28 years and I am very happy in my relationship. My family was not a good family and my childhood was difficult. My mother had mental health issues and probably shouldn\'t have had kids. Both my parents and one sibling are dead and I have one brother now. We keep in touch sporadically. Family for me is something I created as an adult.\n \nMy other passion is writing and I have completed one manuscript which has not been picked up and I have started on another. I sent the first to an agent and she was fairly complementary but suggested I write a memoir rather than fiction but I am not interested in that. Apart from anything else it seems rather arrogant to me. I write most days even if only in my journal and I find it helps me sort the noises in my head.\n \nI have always looked for more and needed intellectual stimulation even as a child. My father was encouraging and we had several books in the house including Readers Digest Abridged Classics. We had an encyclopaedia and a huge really old dictionary which my father picked up in a second hand sale. I used to be fascinated by it as a child and would choose a page randomly and try to understand the words - many of which were old Scots words. I grew up in Scotland.\n \nI moved south in 1987 and I have made a life for myself near London and now have hundreds of books, I cull them regularly and have twice sold off collections to allow me space to read something new. Books are important to me as a sign of learning and also as a sort of security blanket. Knowledge is power after all.\n \nI am not sure if I am agnostic or an atheist. I dither between the two and it changes when I am reading different philosophers. I was brought up Catholic in the West of Scotland in the land of Celtic and Rangers and religious sectarianism and was beaten up many times because of the colour of my school uniform so I am fairly jaundiced about organised faiths but I also understand the Blaise Pascal argument that sometimes is it better to believe just in case...\n \nI would like to study this course to enable me to have structured learning but most importantly to enable me to have someone to communicate with when I don\'t understand something. It is difficult to learn any philosophy entirely from MOOC\'s, You Tube and Google when the entire purpose as I see it is to understand positions and argue positions in a dialectic way so that you can learn and move forward. The risk with me is that I find things that already underline what I feel and believe because that is all I know to search for...\n \nI want to flourish and know that I have lived.', 1, '', 0, 0, 0, '', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', 1, 0, '', ''),

I was born in El Paso, Texas but moved to Oregon when I was three. My parents were excellent and I had a good childhood filled with art and reading, hunting and fishing.\n\nAdolescence\n\nWhen I entered the sixth grade I realized that there were “cool” kids and “outcast” kids, and I wasn’t in the cool group. I spent most of my adolescence feeling inadequate and attempting to compensate for it by doing well in school. Not too well, mind you. I worked just hard enough to get a 3.5 grade point average.\n\nIn the meantime I busied myself with hobbies. I enjoyed hunting, fishing, flying radio controlled airplanes (I still do this), and Civil War reenacting. Most of the positive stories I can recall from my adolescence involve hobbies. Very few involve school. My father was a real believer in the value of doing something for the pure joy of it, and as a father with my own children I carry on that tradition. \n\nDuring my junior year of high school I lost weight and immediately got a girlfriend. The lesson I took from this was that people are shallow and would treat me better if I made myself into what they wanted me to be. I would obsess about my weight for the next six years, terrified of becoming chubby again.\nMy girlfriend dumped me the summer before my senior year. I didn’t like her very much but the rejection stung all the same. My dad actually sent me to therapy for about a month to get over it. This ended up being my first contact with Stoic principles. The therapist helped me to understand that dating and breaking up was, for most people, a natural part of life. He described it as the process of whittling down what you value in another person through experimentation. I could accept it or not, but for most people that’s how it works.\nDuring my senior year Dad challenged me to ask out one girl per month, come what may. He said it wasn’t a requirement, but he wanted me to build some courage and he thought it would be a good thing to do. I was terrified but I did it, getting a “yes” 7 out of 10 times. When it was over I had to wonder what I’d been so afraid of. This was my second great Stoic lesson. \n\nAdulthood\n\nI went to college, met my wife and became a teacher. I worked in an alternative program for 9 years. It was challenging but I enjoyed it for the middle 5 years. I burned out in years 8 and 9. \n\nIn my 10th year of teaching I transferred to a regular education setting and found that the skills I had gained in the alternative setting didn’t transfer at all. It was like being a first year teacher all over again. Adding to my stress load was the fact that my wife and I were expecting our first child.\nI crashed. I became suicidal. I formed a plan. I didn’t want to get help, though, because I thought that help was for the weak. It didn’t occur to me that offing myself demonstrated more weakness than getting help until just before the appointed day for my exit. I went to the doctor, thinking that if it didn’t work I could always kill myself.\n\nShe diagnosed me with major depression, put me on some medication and assigned me a therapist named John. She also suggested that I speak with my clergy. In addition to that I picked up my neglected copy of the Meditations and began to read it every night.\n\nIt was a useful combination of treatment options. Today, eight years later, I am the happiest I’ve ever been. I have good friends, two beautiful children and a wife who loves me, and I seem to be well-respected in my field. I experience moments of joy and serenity in a way that I never have before.\n\nStoicism\n\nIn the course of my therapy, both with John and with my clergy, I found that the most helpful ideas they passed on to me seemed similar to ideas I’d read in the Meditations.  They taught me that people are generally focused on themselves more than they are focused on me, that people often mean well even when they don’t act well, and that focusing on what is in my direct control, namely my own thoughts and actions, will help me not to worry about what other people think of me.\nI became interested in Stoicism when I saw the movie “Gladiator” in 2000. I ordered a copy of Marcus’s Meditations out of idle curiosity and quickly came to realize that it was the most noble book I’d ever read. I had taken a philosophy course in college, but this was unlike anything I’d studied formally. I don’t remember any specifics at all from the course. I really liked the professor and he did teach me to try to view things from multiple perspectives, but as for academic philosophy itself I decided that my time would be better spent on other subjects.  Stoicism, in contrast, is practical. When I applied some of the things I learned my life got better.\n\nReligion\n\nI’ve been a Christian my whole life. I was raised in an Evangelical Church. I remember one day that I said something particularly puritanical that I’d picked up in Sunday school and Dad said “Remember, son, if Jesus showed up at the door of our church a lot of those people wouldn’t let him in. They’d think he was some sort of hippy. Watch your mouth.”\n\nThat was the beginning of my crisis of faith, a crisis which lasted some twenty-three years and so far has led me to the Episcopal Church. If I’m honest what I actually believe is more in line with The Society of Epictetus, but I still go to church.  I have no idea what to do with that, and I currently have nothing particularly intelligent to say about it.\nBooks\n\nMy Stoic library includes a collection of Rufus’s work, the Enchiridion and the Discourses, Seneca’s letters, Irvine’s book and the anthology published by Stoicism Today. I read bits and pieces of them all the time but I’ve done no formal study. I’m a cafeteria Stoic but I’d like to be more than that.  \n\nMy Identity\n\nI think that I am a theistic Stoic. Am I a Christian Stoic? I don’t know. What I do know is that I want to grow in this tradition. I want to experience the joy and serenity that Mr. Weigardt has found. Stoicism has already made my life better, but I know that it can be better still.\n', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, '', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', 1, 0, '', ''),

I graduated from Brown Deer High School in 1996 and then attended the University of Minnesota –Twin Cities for one year before moving back to Milwaukee. I attended the University of Wisconsin at Milwaukee (UWM) for a number of years, but did not finish since life got in the way. During my studies, I studied Latin, Greek, and Ancient/Classical History.\n\nNeeding to start anew, I moved to China in 2003 to teach English at Jiangsu University in Zhenjiang, China. Due to SARS, my contract was cut short and I returned to the US in 2004. I promptly started working with General Electric Healthcare, where I still work to this day. In 2008, I moved to Germany as part of a promotion deal. I currently reside in Karlsruhe, Germany.\n \nThroughout my life, religion and philosophy have played a major role. My parents raised my brother and myself without religion. Their idea was that we should seek out and follow the path that is right for us. My brother at a very early age took the “no path” and has remained a committed agnostic/atheist his whole life. I unfortunately have taken the path less travelled.\n \nMy interest in philosophy started with a high school course named “Literature and Philosophy”. In fact, the book that sparked my deep love for philosophy is “The Tao of Pooh” and its explanation of living according to nature. In University I was exposed to all sorts of philosophies and philosophers. In 2000, one professor introduced me to Epictetus, who quickly became a hero and role-model for me.\n \nDuring my studies and up to the present, I have read most of the great works of Stoic Philosophy and key general texts, including but not limited to: The Discourses, Epictetus; Enchiridion, Epictetus; The Meditations, Aurelius; Letters to a Stoic (Penguin Publishing version), Seneca; Epictetus: A Stoic and Socratic Guide to Live, A.A. Long; God and Cosmos in Stoicism, Ricardo Salles; Stoic Theology, P.A. Meijer; A Guide to the Good Life, William Irvine; etc.\n\nDuring my long search for the ‘right path’, I have belonged to many different religious organizations. Catholicism has always been a fallback in my life as I come from a largely liberal-Catholic family. But was never a member of the Church until after many years of studying other religions.\n \nFirstly, I studied Islam under the Imam in Milwaukee for 2 years. There are many respectable things in Islam but in the end I could not convert because of their views on women and homosexuality. After this I started attending a Zen Buddhist organization in Milwaukee and learning about Buddhism. I also enrolled in a philosophy class at UWM on Buddhism and Hinduism. And shortly after all of this is when I moved to China. I studied Buddhism there at one of the local Temples and took my 5 Precepts (Wu Jie) and started training towards become a “chu jia ren”, a type of stay-at-home monk. I also spent time with Confucianists and Taoists to gain a fundamental grasp of their worldviews. But my impromptu departure stopped those studies. I found American Buddhism to be wholly different and incompatible with the Buddhism I practiced in China. I then realized that I could not continue down that path.\n\nThe next period of my religious adventures fall in the Abrahamic category and is quite blurry. I studied Judaism and Catholicism concurrently, passing back and forth fluidly. In early 2008, I was confirmed but by 2010, I was in a conversion course for Judaism that completed in 2011. This fluidity was due to my unable to grasp the Christian concept of “why do we need Jesus if God is omnipotent?” and how many Jewish writings actually seem to agree with Christianity in the end. But shortly afterwards, the Chief Rabbinate in New York overturned conversions done by the Rabbi, who I studied with and I found myself creedless, not by my own doing. The Rabbinate in Berlin has offered for me to start all over again, but I found myself not really accepting either faith tradition. I was more attracted to the ritual idea than the underlying truth. Also, I realized that Catholicism had been a comfortable crutch, not something I needed or wanted but helped me walk along.\n\nAll during this time, I had also travelled and experienced these and other religious traditions. I travelled to Israel numerous times to study with different rabbis and priests and even spent time with high-ranking members of the Muslim community there. Later, I travelled to Vietnam and spent time with Cao Dai’ists learning their faith and tradition, which I very much admire in its foundational beliefs. I’ve also travelled to India and Indonesia experiencing firsthand the two traditions of Hinduism and experiencing a different side to the Muslim story.\n \nThrough my studies, I have read about most classical schools of philosophy, but would not consider myself an expert in any of them. I was always enamored with the Cynics, but my Buddhist training always makes me skeptical of beliefs in the extreme. Platonism and Neo-Platonism have been influential in my life as well, but ultimately without a proper teacher, this learning was merely a hobby. In more modern philosophy, I find myself a strong advocate of Rousseau and his teachings about equality, property, education, and social contract theory.\n \nAll of these experiences have molded and tempered my views about God since I have been exposed to most of the commonest views of Him. I have always seen God as both immanent and transcendent, though most religious views reject this. I accept the concept of the corporeal soul. But strongly favor a type of pan(en)theism. I find the arguments, which I’ve read by the Stoics and their modern commentators regarding God, to be very persuasive. I have always accepted a type of palingenesis.\n  \nI consider myself a de facto Stoic. The Enchiridion is never far from my side and I find myself often quoting it when others ask for my advice. The Meditations of Aurelius is my nighttime reading almost every night. And Seneca takes up the bookshelf space closest to my home office. Because of my Buddhist meditation practices, learning “negative visualization” (Irvine) has come naturally to me.\n\nI always accepted that a practical philosophical path was right for me, but it required finding the right support-organization to make it a way-of-life instead of an academic exercise. This is why I often fell to religion instead of philosophy, as practical organizations are in overabundance! I hope that this course will provide for me the practical daily applications of Stoicism and help develop apatheia. While at the same time, I’m extremely interested in solidifying my basic and foundation understanding of Stoic physics and logic.

I have one brother. I spent my formative childhood in Billings, Montana where a young boy could go outdoors and explore. It was a perfect childhood for the most part.\n\nIn my junior high years, I moved to Arlington, TX where I spent the rest of my life, except for a small stint in Kanas for one year in college. I was involved in music, drama and wrote my own songs as well. I also practiced Tae-Kwon Do. I went to college, got married, left college, divorced, went back to college, did more dramas and musicals, and got a degree in Marketing and got married again. \nAs a man in my 20’s and early 30’s, I was deeply religious Christian. This occurred mostly because I had a creative brain that craved structure, and the strict religion provided it.\n\nIn my mid thirties, I was struck with a crippling depression. It left me broke, divorced, unemployed, and living with my parents. I became an atheist at that time as God’s biblical “promise” that he would give me peace and self control was obviously false.  \n\nI lost all my friends in my church for this decision. My social network vanished.\n\nI went to support groups and got serious about brain science with a determination to beat my depression. I realized that depressed people often make great writers, so I aimed at becoming a copywriter and/or technical writer.\n-\nA worthy martial arts teacher found his way into my life, and I started the journey to become a black belt. The system was an old-school in its methods, and it took me ten years to achieve the rank. \n\nIn the middle of that, I landed a dream creative job! \n\nI spent eight years as the creative editor for Score Entertainment, a leading producer of trading card games, a game category targeting mostly teenage boys. I met my current wife, and my sons, and I got to play games for fun and work. \n\nI wrote all the ads, TV spots, rulebooks, sales material and demo games. It was a magical time and highly stressful. \n\nSoon after I got my Job at Score, I married Misty and we just passed fourteen years together in total. I have beaten depression, and have rich relationships in my life except for some bitter ex-family members who still hate me for rejecting my faith. \n\nI became a Zen Buddhist and well versed in eastern thought. I read most of the Buddhist texts and explored the Buddhist world looking for a version that was more closely aligned with science. I eventually went with Soto Zen, but without a Soto Zendo close by, it was slow going. \n\nAfter my job with Score Entertainment went away in 2008, I became a personal fitness trainer.\n\nSince 2006, I’ve become obsessed with understanding cult psychology and how people get sucked into abusive groups and how cognitive dissonance prevents them from escaping the thought loops that entrap them. I am very well versed in the works of Robert J. Lifton and other experts on the subject. \n\nMy chief focus in this self-study in cult psychology has been the Church of Scientology. No other organization creates the level of cognitive dissonance in its members. I worked online and spent three years on forums and blogs with former members and critics.\n\nI didn’t protest publicly, as many have done, because Scientology has a well-known “dirty tricks” department which could cause stress to my family. I was content to just help people sort out their experiences. \n\nI learned a lot, and read most of L. Ron Hubbard’s seductive books - critically, while studying his criminal past and the effects his teachings had on people long term.\n\nFrightening.  \n\nBut there was one thing in my Scientology venture that baffled me is that even though I knew Scientology was a cult, and that it didn’t create super-humans, I was amazed at how effective the methods were in the early courses (before the Xenu mythology appears). This is demonstrated in the documentary “A Beginner’s Guide to L. Ron Hubbard” which is now on YouTube.\n\nI saw in that documentary and though personal experience that people really want a SAFE place to come and be improved. A SAFE place where they can deal with the issues of life with lay practitioners working together.\n\nAnd Scientology does deliver the EXPERIENCE of a safe place, but the REALITY is that it FEELS safe while one is receiving brainwashing at the deepest possible level as their assets vanish. \n\nMy efforts in Scientology left me sad. \n\nI longed for something like Scientology that wasn’t evil and actually helped people. I wished there was a body of life practices that was cult-free and empowered people to deal with life as it really is. \n\nI found Stoicism by accident by taking a “What Philosophy School are You?” test on Facebook. After I took the test, it replied with this answer: \n\n“You are a Stoic.”\n\nAs I read about Stoicism, I came across “Stoic Month” the very week it had begun. So I enrolled, went through the lessons and found that I really WAS a Stoic. The glib Facebook test was right. \n\nBut the ideas were not new to me at all. \n\nI pretty much came to the same conclusions Seneca and Epictetus did long before I ever took the course. I also became well versed in Pythagorean thought and read all the source material available on his life. Like Kurt Gödel, I consider myself a mathematical realist, not a popular position scientifically. \n\nI count myself 75% stoic, 15% Pythagorean and 10% Soto Zen.\n\nI’ve read “Meditations” several times, listened to audio books summarizing Seneca’s teachings, I read Epictetus’ “Enchiridion” and completed Stoic Month. \n\nI expect to learn and apply Stoic techniques and Philosophy from your courses and to complete them all. \n', 1, '', 0, 0, 0, '', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 'NOTE: William Harper applied for MA School on 19 JUN 19 and was rejected on 21 JUN.

I hold a B.A. in Philosophy from the University of Wisconsin-Madison and an M.F.A. in Theatre from Western Illinois University.\n\nFor the first half of my adult life, I worked first in the theatre (as a director, actor, stage manager, and production designer), then in the motion picture industry.  I was accepted in 1994 into the Directors Guild Assistant Director Training Program, which led to about eight years of work in feature films and television.\n\nFinding the freelance work in film to be more stressful than fulfilling, I transitioned back to the nonprofit world and have since worked as, first, an executive director, then a finance and operations professional.\n\nI have been married to the former Elizabeth Chesley since 2003--we were married in a civil ceremony in Scotland, having met at a Scottish Highland Games in 2001.\n\nAddressing the stipulated topics for this essay sequentially:\n\nMy interest in Stoicism extends further back than I can put a date—or even a year—on, but I know that I was citing Marcus Aurelius as a major personal influence at least as far back as 2006, when I offered a public toast to him as a Neopagan event.  The Meditations have been on my nightstand since at least that time.  At a Neopagan conference in early 2008, I had presented a workshop entitled “Moderation and Personal Fitness in Paganism” that was largely derived from Stoic material.  Over the intervening years, I have proceeded to reading Epictetus and Seneca, along with secondary materials, and Stoicism has taken on an integral role in my worldview.\n\nAs of this point in time, apart from general studies in Classical philosophy that touch on Stoicism, I have read all of Seneca’s Letters, all of the extant works of Epictetus, and—as referenced above—the Meditations of Marcus Aurelius.  I have also read Gilbert Murray’s book on the Stoic philosophy.\n\nI am resolutely non-supernaturalist in orientation as regards my attitude toward Deity, but, at the same time, I have held legal clergy credentials in polytheistic Neopaganism since 1999.  I self-describe as polytheistic, but am what has come to be called a “soft polytheist” (as opposed to a “hard polytheist,” who see the gods and goddesses as fully independent from human beings). I recognize deities as independent influences in my life, operating in the unconscious from within and poetry and mythology from without.\n\nThe beautiful and the sublime in Nature speak to me as well.  Japanese Shinto traditions have been of interest to me here:  The embrace of animist and polytheist ritual and ideology within an essentially secular and technological society has resonated very strongly with me over the past couple of years in particular.\n\nExposure to the ideas of C.G. Jung as early as my college years has inescapably shaped my thinking about the idea of “God” (and “gods”).  While I am somewhat agnostic as to the idea of transpersonal consciousness, the conceit of a collective/archetypal dimension to the personal unconscious has always been appealing to me.  In addition to providing context for thinking about the nature of the Numinous Other, Jungian concepts also provide some insight into Platonic thought about transcendent forms.\n\nMore broadly, I have been deeply influenced by Daoism since my late teens and one of the attractions of Stoicism for me is my ability to frame the Logos in the same context as the Dao.  Similarly, the Vedic concept of Rta holds profound appeal for me and also provides a way of understanding Logos.  I am skeptical of the notion of a consciousness in the Cosmos that is in any sense cognate to human consciousness, but have always felt a creative unfolding as being pervasive in the Universe.  (Indeed, one of the most influential books I ever read was a study of Vedism entitled "The Artful Universe.")\n\nAs to religious orientation, I have been both a member of and even a founder of more than one polytheistic Neopagan fellowship.  As my skepticism (and self-reflection) have grown more acute with passing years, I have begun to distance myself from what is most often called “Reconstructionist Paganism.”  I am still a principal in the Fellowship of Druidism for the Latter Age (aka FoDLA), a Neopagan Druidic denomination I founded in 2006, but have been handing over the reins of leadership to successors.  Prior to founding FoDLA, I was in leadership in another, older Druidic denomination called ADF; I left that fellowship out of dissatisfaction with its internal politics.\n\nI am also involved on a minimal level with the Spiritual Naturalist Society, serving nominally as its Los Angeles chapter organizer.\n\nI was raised by a Unitarian mother and atheist father, so I was exposed to multiple religious perspectives as a child and escaped any sort of indoctrination.  (The closest I came to a religious upbringing was periodic attendance at Unitarian “Sunday school” and a brief membership in a UU college campus fellowship.)\n\nIn truth, although I identify as Pagan and am best described as an archetypal (or Romantic) polytheist, I have always been open to multiple spiritual influences as they have deepened my connection to society, the moral realm, and the Cosmos more generally.  Over the course of my adult life, I have integrated philosophical Daoism, French Existentialism, archetypal polytheism/Jungian psychology, Romanticism, Shintoism, and Stoic philosophy into my worldview.\n\nI have both studied and embraced other philosophies apart from Stoicism:  As I note in passing above, French Existentialism was a profound influence on me.  I majored in Philosophy at the University of Wisconsin and was exposed to Sartre, Camus, Merleau-Ponty, and others at that time.  Sartre, in particular, was a major influence on me.\n\nDuring the course of my philosophy major, I studied the usual suspects—the Ancients (principally Plato and Aristotle) and the Moderns (Descartes, Spinoza, Leibniz, Locke, Berkeley, Hume, and Kant).  I had a particular emphasis in aesthetics and am highly influenced by Edmund Burke’s essay on the sublime, especially taken in the context of the Romantic movement that followed.\n\nMore recently, I have been very taken by the efforts of the American philosopher Richard Rorty to formulate a public, non-supernatural religious path suited to the American culture, which he labelled “Romantic Polytheism.”  His ideas embrace social consciousness and individual religious liberty, looking to the exercise of democracy as a sacred ritual.\n\nLastly, as to the question of whether or not I choose to describe as “a Stoic,” it is undeniable that Stoic philosophy is—as I note above—an integral part of my worldview.  When I had a recent cancer scare, there is no question that I turned instinctively to a Stoic perspective on the prospect of a possible terminal diagnosis.  (Which did not, as it happens, ultimately come to pass.)\n\nI hope to make use of this course to deepen and further concretize my application of Stoic philosophy to my life and perhaps go further to take on more advanced studies.\n', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, '', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', 1, 0, '', ''),

My friend and I worked on his business, which was a publishing business that sold directly to the customer. My responsibility - and it turns out my talent - was writing, marketing and strategy.\r\n\r\nBecause of the facts of life related to these facts of life, it quickly became clear the way to success was twofold:\r\n\r\n	1. To transcend your own limitations - the ideas you had about what you could and could not be, as a human being. These include the ability you have to create change in the world and the ability you have to influence others.\r\n	2. To understand people on a fundamental level, as you\'d constantly be dealing with them - partners, co-workers and clients. This began as an attempt to manipulate others, but very quickly became the intention to understand them. You can\'t learn about someone\'s hopes, fears and desires without quickly caring about them and wanting what\'s best for them.\r\n\r\nThese were my goals and my questions. So while my colleagues and competitors were driven to books on the tactics of marketing and business strategy, I was driven to books on human nature. It quickly became apparent to me that most of these books - the ones truly about a human\'s nature, as opposed to their psychology - came from a religion or a philosophical school. So I studied them.\r\n\r\nPursuing my first goal led me to "philosophies" of excellence and achievement - productivity, leadership, strategy, self-development, psychology. \r\n\r\nPursuing the second led me to the philosophies of faith.\r\n\r\nOddly enough, neither lead me to a philosophy of ethics or action. So I would greatly develop my understanding of the world, people and how we work without truly developing a guiding compass beyond impulse. Something I wouldn\'t realize until I later discovered Stoicism.\r\n\r\nDuring this time, I studied many philosophies and faiths, and found they all experienced a similar "ground of being." The Stoics - I believe - call this "Nature." Many if not most also believe in a causal chain of events. (Even early Christianity experienced both.)\r\n\r\nI first heard of Zen from a mentor I admired, and so pursued it\'s study with a vengeance. I still practice Zen meditation as part of my best routine. I still find peace from the Zen teachings - and reading Zen Mind, Beginner\'s Mind again after learning about Stoicism has actually clarified many of the ideas of BOTH philosophies, for me. They seem to have much in common.\r\n\r\nFrom the study of Zen, I expanded outwards to other Eastern philosophies and spiritualties. I found the most traction besides Zen in Tantra, under the teachings of Osho and in Hinduism (kind of) under the teachings of Joseph Campbell. \r\n\r\nI would continue to read and study and live as best I could while developing our company. Eventually, we became quite "successful" in all accepted definitions of the world. The business itself was running in such a way that we would never need worry about money again.\r\n\r\nThen a major turning point came: I realized the person I was working with wasn\'t who I thought he was. And that the work we were doing was unfulfilling.\r\n\r\nThe first came about when we finally discussed our contracts. We hadn\'t made any to begin with. And so when it came time to set the terms, I found out everything was under his name and therefore attributed to him.  I was left out in the cold.\r\n\r\nThe second came about once I had the greed kicked out of me - realizing that all I had created up to this point in my life was this company… and that it had no love for me, in return. We weren\'t necessarily doing good work. In many cases, we were doing bad work, by my budding values. Yet I was continuing in the name of money.\r\n\r\nI quit my "job" and had a mental breakdown.\r\n\r\nI was so attached to the idea that this company was me, that breaking from it shifted everything internally. I experienced an actual mental break for a weekend, then resettled to a state of consistent anxiety. I experienced panic attacks constantly and for absolutely no reason. I was completely lost in the water.\r\n\r\nI looked at my life and decided a few things: First, that I would not take drugs for the anxiety or for the panic. That I would deal with them head on.\r\n\r\nSecond, that I would find my own way in the world, following my own internal compass, wherever it would take me. (This was the evolution of my commitment to excellence - now it was a commitment to honoring my own path. That I would develop the wisdom, courage and self-discipline to pursue it wherever it led, though I wouldn\'t define them as those terms, yet.)\r\n\r\nFinally, that I would find balance in my life. That I would treat my Self and therefore my Life as more than simply a career and a bank account. I had no idea what this meant, but it would lead me to a deeper delve into all of my philosophical and spiritual research.\r\n\r\nI looked at my panic as a terrible thing for years for obvious reasons. But I\'ve learned to accept it as necessary, or even beneficial, because it gave me the following insights into life:\r\n\r\nFirst, that mental anguish is caused by your own reactions or judgements as to what is really happening, more than the reality itself. (I can\'t tell you how many times I experienced panic because I believed my heart was failing… when the reality was my heart was fine.)\r\n\r\nSecond, that the true goal in life is to live a "Happy" life. Since I had panic and struggled with anxiety, a "Happy" life to me was simply a day where nothing was happening. A calm state of mind. What I would eventually understand as "Tranquility."\r\n\r\nIn this journey, I became decoupled from my religious beliefs as I routinely experienced both the "ground" of nature and the casual chain of events - always able to trace my entire journey to here and now to the fact I sat next to a boy in my High School Spanish class. Sometimes able to trace the chain back to somewhere in my father\'s life.\r\n\r\nI\'d say that makes me an ex-deist. I\'m 100% rationally committed to this position, although I\'d say I\'m 80% emotionally "in it." I was raised Christian, live in a Christian culture and haven\'t yet come to full terms with my mortality (being just 28 years old.)\r\n\r\nSo the idea of a God and an afterlife is comforting to me on a sub-conscious level. \r\n\r\nAt the same time, I was realizing that my potential as a human being was being untapped with the lifestyle I was living. It started out realizing I could simply "do" more… but then I realized I could "be" more as well. So productivity led to philosophy.\r\n\r\nI would later understand my drive was to "realize the part of man Nature had left unfinished," but I had no words for it at the time. So I dove deeper into my Zen practice and tried to define / live by a set of values. Looking back, I would treat them as ornaments rather than guideposts, and value the values themselves less than strongly enough to guide my life by them.\r\n\r\nUntil I read the Stoics, I had no idea values could be THE central value in life.\r\n\r\nFast forward to a few months ago and I found myself again successful materially but personally stagnated. I had just bought a house, was in a great relationship, but realized I was stagnated in my career and in my personal view on the world and my development of my personality. (Still battling anxiety and attached to control.)\r\n\r\nSo I began looking for the next step for me, as a human being. And I discovered Stoicism at about the same time I started transitioning my business to something more challenging, but also more in line with a mission, as opposed to creating wealth or focusing on strength.\r\n\r\nI\'d read Meditations a few times, in my search for honest wisdom, but hadn\'t been exposed to Stoic philosophy, before. So my first book on Stoicism was probably "Stoicism and the Art of Happiness." It was in this book I realized my philosophy for the world and for my life was summed up in the Stoic group of ideas. Yet the Stoics added ideas like an internal compass and releasing control - ideas I needed to continue developing as a man, yet hadn\'t come to realize, myself. (Beyond knowing I needed to "let go" and having no good model to actually do it.)\r\n\r\nIn the last month, believe it or not, Stoicism completely got rid of my anxiety. When practicing, I\'m not anxious and don\'t have panic… which is indifferent in the Stoic view of the world, but is a sign to me that this is the path I want to pursue.\r\n\r\nAnd you can imagine that - after living with panic for coming on five years, now - even a few moments of "Tranquility" at a time is worth throwing my whole weight behind following this school of thought and integrating it into my life. (By which I mean living by it, whole heartedly.)\r\n\r\nI realized that the only true way to integrate this philosophy into my life is to live and to practice it, which is why I\'m interested in this course. My experience tells me two things:\r\n\r\n	1. To achieve anything meaningful in a discipline which can take a lifetime to master, you have to leverage the ideas and influence of someone more experienced than yourself. So I hope to find a mentor who can guide me in the principles I may have missed, and help me incorporate them into a fulfilling lifestyle. To achieve this end, I\'ll do whatever is asked of me in terms of homework, assignments and implementation.\r\n	2. To achieve anything worthwhile, you benefit from accountability and community. So I hope to find both as a result of this program. Like the Stoics are so fond of believing, wisdom is APPLIED knowledge. I believe that most firmly. So I\'m hoping to turn this interest in Stoicism into a life-long commitment and lifestyle.\r\n\r\nThat brings us to where we are in my life, right now. My absolute highest two aims in life are to live a life in line with Nature and to continue the work Nature began with my personality. I believe these find homes in Stoicism and that Stoic philosophy - when practiced - holds me to a higher version of myself than I\'d be, simply allowed to live by habit and impulse.\r\n\r\n\r\nI feel I would benefit from this course, but that\'s out of my control.

To be free of passion and yet full of love.” (Meditations 115)\n        After an argument with my fiancée, then girlfriend, I sat on our porch and asked myself for the first time in my life a very simple question “why do I get angry so easily?” Unbeknownst to me, this question was about to lead me on a journey of self-discovery and change in self-identity. To understand how I got to where I am today it’s best to start from the beginning. \n         I was born on March 25th, 1987 at Travis Air Force base in Fairfield, CA. When I was younger I was confused of why I was born at an Air Force base when my father, William, was a Navy diver. Like most children who ponder such questions I asked my mother, Lori. Knowing that my parents were no longer together and at some point they loved each other to have two children, my brother and myself, I began a child’s interrogation of her mother. After the line of questioning I concluded that my mother wasn’t happy with my father because he avoided arguments and was uncomfortable getting angry or talking about serious topics. At that time I was unhappy living with my mother and stepfather and I looked up to my dad. Since I only saw him for a short two months every summer any new information into how he acted I took as how I should act. I believed it was best to avoid arguments and if a serious topic started I should feel uncomfortable, this stayed with me for awhile. \n	I grew up in a growing suburb of Austin, Texas. When my mother and stepfather moved my brother and me to Texas. I remember the day they asked me about the impending move “do you want to move to Texas?” I was in 2nd grade and my reply was “sure, as long as we live in a house instead of a trailer.” Looking back I do not know why that was so important to me. However, the disappointment that I felt when we moved into a very small three-bedroom trailer with a hole in the hallway resonated for years. Growing up I constantly felt disappointed of my surroundings, however, it fueled me. I worked hard in high school, went to Purdue University and studied Genetics and now studying medicine at Ross University. \n	During my undergraduate studies I began exploring other religions to answer the question “Is there a god and if there is how can a human understand him.” I grew up Baptist and went to church every Wednesday night, Sunday morning and evening. My stepfather often signed me up to do charity work such as mowing the church lawn and doing yard work for elderly church members. I enjoyed giving back and helping others. However, I never felt like what I was being told in sermon or learning in Sunday school was the truth. This led me to believe that maybe the truth was masked by hundreds of years of changing the Christian church. So I asked a friend of mine if I could go with her on Sunday’s to the Orthodox Catholic Church. She agreed and informed me of their traditions, why they kept traditions and the differences from a Baptist church. After going with her for a couple months again I feel like what I was not being told was the truth. Today I consider myself a theist. However, I will continue searching and reading until I find an answer to this question “Is there a god and if there is how can a human understand him.”\n	After I graduated from Purdue University I started my medical training in Dominica at Ross University. There I met the love of my life, Angela Chua. From the first time I saw her I knew that my life was going to change. She’s the most beautiful and amazing person I’ve ever met or will ever meet. It was because of her that I began my discovery into Stoicism. \n	When I was sitting on that porch asking myself “why do I get angry so easily?” I took into account my past, my education and understanding of neuroscience, examples of when I did not get angry and when I didn’t. \n	I knew that when an external stimulus enters the limbic system of our brains it is interpreted and a reaction takes place. Thus, when I felt like I was being attacked, which lead to our argument, I felt like I needed to defend myself. I believe this reaction was due to growing up with my stepfather. Due to reasons not stated, I always felt like I had to argue with him on anything and everything. Also, the feelings of disappointment in my youth have led me to feel like I do not deserve to be happy and no matter what I do I will remain unhappy. I realized that the avoidance of feeling uncomfortable when talking about topics that I do not want to has led me to be selfish. These thoughts and feels have made me discover that I react to situations in an unhealthy way.\nAfter this discovery I knew that this was not the way to be. This is not the way to live. This has led me to considering myself a Stoic. While reading “Meditations by Marcus Aurelius” I made myself a daily reading to help me everyday to work on changing the way I perceive the world around me. \n	When I wake up every morning I remind myself that today people will be ungrateful, arrogant, dishonest, jealous and disrespectful. They do this because they cannot recognize this. None of them can hurt me because I will not let the external world affect the internal mind. I need to keep the mind focused and refrain from letting any emotion display. Today my mind will be tested I must remain controlled. \n	Before studying everyday I remind myself that procrastination is founded in the belief that there is time to get things done. Procrastination uses distractions to keep the illusion of an infinite amount of time we’re given. Truth is; we’re here for a limited amount of time and letting procrastination take hold of our lives in wasting the time we’re given. Accomplish tasks with seriousness and precision. Doing this will free your mind from distractions. \nAt mid-day I remind myself to never act under compulsion, out of selfishness and without forethought or malice, to not exaggerate my thoughts or use surplus words or unnecessary actions. I should remain under control of my mind, be just, honest and courageous. I should rely only on myself for my welfare and happiness, and never to expect or let others be the source of my happiness. I remind myself “my ability to control your thoughts treat it with respect. It’s all that protects your mind from false perceptions false to your nature, and that of all rational beings. It’s what makes thoughtfulness possible, and affection for other people.” (Meditations 157)\nBefore going to sleep I write in my journal about my thoughts and how I can improve myself, then remind myself to “Forget everything else. Keep hold of this alone and remember it: Each of us lives only now, this brief instant. The rest has been lived already, or is impossible to see. The span we live is small—small as the corner of the earth in which we live it.” (Meditations 160)\nI’ve been reading “Meditation’s by Marcus Aurelius” and have started reading “The Golden Sayings of Epictetus”. Since I’ve been interested in Stoicism for about six months now I want this course to aid in my self-study, learn from others in the class and gain understanding from the teacher. I believe this course will give me a better perspective of Stoicism that I would not be able to gain on my own. \n\nCitations:\nHays, Gregory Hays, and Marcus Aurelius. Meditations.

I grew up in Southern Indiana, the son of a preacher and a preacher\'s wife. By the age of seven I knew the Sunday School situation back to front and probably could have taught the class myself, but what I recall most clearly from then--from one of the thickest points in my religious indoctrination--was the crafts. The stuff we got to use was absolutely awesome: all the glue and popsicle sticks and crayons and felt a fellow could need in his entire life. It wasn\'t much later on that I got baptized exactly when I knew I was supposed to, even though no one had told me when that was. And then in my early adolescence my engagement in the church intensified and I actually went through a second baptism, becoming identified among the congregation as a "strong believer," though in the years that have followed I\'ve come to recognize that there is nothing quite as dangerous as a zealous teenager who has learned all the right answers by rote.\r\n\r\nAs I matured, other parts of my identity and my needs as a human came into focus for me and by the time I was a sixteen I had rejected the religion of my parents and my community; I had no respect left for that world, but I spent the next years seeking out a new one out for myself, something to fill that void. It was the beginning of my long career as a raging atheist who held the secret hope of being proved wrong.\r\n\r\nWhen it came time for college I fled to the Massachusetts, which I saw as the most liberal state in the liberal Northeast. I wanted a fresh start and, in some ways, I got one. I was exposed to some philosophy in a traditional introductory course, but found a home for myself in the philosophies and theories of Sigmund Freud and Jacques Lacan, as well as some postmodern theorists, like Michel Foucault. It felt as though, finally, it all made sense to me. It was a lens through which I could understand nearly everything in the world and with a firm understanding of these theories and a their arguments always on the tip of my tongue, I felt like I knew my place in a world that seemed to have been translated perfectly.\r\n\r\nExcept that it wasn\'t.\r\n\r\nWhile the theories of these philosophers were beautiful--and I still find Lacan absolutely breathtaking--they didn\'t seem to do much in terms of helping me with my own struggles, both internal and external, but mostly internal. I would often take center stage on the porch of our apartment on campus, ranting intelligibly [or at least I thought] about the Real and the Phallus, but that didn\'t seem to help me in the least with understanding how to navigate my own suffering and it certainly didn\'t help me live a happier life.\r\n\r\nWhile my respect for the work of the psychoanalysts was confirmed during my education to become a psychotherapist and while I even found other philosophers and theorists to admire, the same difficulty remained: I loved reading about theory and talking about theory, but it didn\'t seem to do much in my life, didn\'t seem to ameliorate that small empty space inside of my chest, that aching spot that would on occasion grow into a chasm.\r\n\r\nAnd so, here I am. I\'m a therapist who is primarily influenced by third-wave cognitive-behavioral therapies and who is painfully aware that the kindest words of the best of my own therapists have rarely touched that empty feeling inside of me. I\'m a man who lives with his partner--who happens to be a guy--and who is relatively well-adjusted, but still feels the weight of those old orthodoxies on top of me like a lead blanket. I\'m a guy who doesn\'t eat meat or dairy because I know it doesn\'t make sense to love a dog while exploiting a cow, even if I don\'t know the fancy philosophical wording to make that seem convincing. And I\'m a guy who likes to make things still, just like when I was seven and in Sunday School.\r\n\r\nDo I know myself? Not really, but I know some things about myself.\r\n\r\nI know I\'m no longer a Baptist nor a Lacanian. I\'m not even a Buddhist, though there was a time when I read enough Pema Chodron and Thich Nhat Hanh to put anyone to sleep. And I\'m not an occultist, even if I do own ten decks of tarot cards, nor a Hindu, though some of my current computer passwords created in 2001 might suggest that I am. I\'m not a Taoist even though I\'ve read about eight translations of the Tao Te Ching. If anything, I suppose I\'m something a kin to "an otherwise employed seeker," who is interested in and searches out theories and possible answers to the questions I have about life and about myself, but without having the privilege or courage to attempt to do so as a full-time job. I know that I am searching and have always been searching for a way to live a happy life.\r\n\r\nI can\'t say exactly when I first stumbled upon Stoicism, though I know that it must have come back around some time around last November because I took part in the "Live Like A Stoic Week" that happened around Thanksgiving. After a few months of being otherwise fully I occupied, I returned to the literature of Stoicism in order to study it more thoroughly. I started reading and I started taking notes. Lots of notes. I suppose I knew it was going to be an ongoing pursuit once I gave up on notebooks and started writing on loosely sewed paper leaflets because I had the strong sense that this endeavor wasn\'t going to be particularly containable.\r\n\r\nDespite the preoccupations involved in a moving house, I\'ve remained diligent enough in my reading to be somewhat impressed with myself. After Epictetus\' handbook, I read Irvine\'s book and then Marcus Aurelius\' Meditations. I would return to the handbook several times in different translations and with thorough notes. I read about six of Seneca\'s longer letters before feeling the need to get a better sense of the deeper aspects of Stoicism that aren\'t directly addressed in these works. I\'ve read about a hundred pages of encyclopedic entries on Stoic Logic, Physics, Ethics, and Philosophy of Mind, as well as a handful of essays I\'ve discovered on New Stoa and linked through the College of Stoic Philosophers. All of that being said, my passion for most of the summer has been Epictetus\' Discourses. Some of his writing is clear and brutal while other stretches are absolutely beautiful, almost lyrical. And, of course, I think he can be absolutely hilarious. After reading this--while yet again taking nearly two hundred pages of notes--I spent an evening or two absolutely heartbroken to discover that there were another four books of discourses that have been lost to us. In conversation I\'ve found myself casually saying, "Well, I think my friend Epictetus would say..."\r\n\r\nI want to take this course because it is a prerequisite for the Marcus Aurelius school, which is what I am most interested in. It\'s frankly been difficult for me to decide whether or not I should apply for the SES course as I\'ve read so much of the required reading so recently and so closely and because the cost of these courses present a significant burden to me and my family. I have decided, however, that I want to be committed to a further exploration of Stoic philosophy and I believe I could be helped by the aid of a mentor. Perhaps in rereading for the SES course I will make an even deeper relationship with these texts. I\'ve also written for more information about the Cleanthes Scholarship. I am excited to learn more from the book by John Sellars, which is already on my desk begging to be read. I also know I\'m prepared to get as much as possible out of the SES course--and hopefully the Marcus Aurelius school as well--because both of my post-secondary education programs have had a large emphasis on self-guided learning.\r\n\r\nAnd so, no, I am not a Stoic. But I am currently a very serious student of Stoicism and I hope to be able to continue these studies here with your school.', 1, '', 1, 0, 0, '', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', 0, 1, '', 'Don\'t have exact date, but probably in 2017');

I was born in a well-to-do town neighboring the affluent.  That put’s a person in-between worlds.  What should have been a great life compared to everyone else, appears as a tolerable one next to those with cabins in Tahoe and SUVs to spare.  The path that put me on was Boy Scouts, drama, and later scholarly pursuits.  During my elementary and high school years, scouting is where I really began to flourish; I found my voice, and it turned out to be loud and boisterous.  I became a public speaker, I became an instructor, I became a planner, I became a leader.  My closest friends to this day speak either to the quality of scouting or my inability to make new friends.  \n\nIn acting I found a latent talent that I was able to develop.  Towards the beginning of my acting “career,” it would appear that the volume of my voice was my singular asset, but as time went on, I found nuance and character.  And for a while, I considered as a possible profession, and though there are many things I like about acting, the commodification of my art and passion would be too much of a compromise, as well as working with <shudder> other actors.  A fun diverting group of people, who don\'t always have the high degree of work ethic that makes group projects hum.  \n\nAfter high school, I went to UCSC.  I studied politics and minored in law. I actively avoided philosophy and theory, likening it to hitting your head against the wall.  In retrospect, the questions of ethics that were asked in those classrooms stick with me to this day.  Usually I like having the answer to a question, but these are the exception to the rule.  I come across situations all the time and ask myself which is the “good” scenario and which is the “right” scenario.  It often seems like the “right” scenario is just the patient version of the “good” scenario.  When I attended UCSC, the school did not require that students get grades.  I was overjoyed with the amorphous Narrative Evaluations we would be receiving.  Now I see that it really helped foster an interest in the material, and not in the grade.  Perhaps grades would’ve helped learn more then, but I don’t think I would’ve been as interested in continuing it into my personal life.  \n\nAfter college, it was hard to know what to do.  My catholicism was waning, and I didn’t have a lot of money to spend.  I frequently found myself at my local book store listening to authors come and speak.  One particular highlight, and the beginning of my lifelong fandom, was listening Neil Degrasse Tyson speak; little did I know that he would be one of the people cushioning my descent into atheism.  The other speaker was James O’Toole, an education professor at USC, who wrote a book called Creating the Good Life: Applying Aristotle\'s Wisdom to Find Meaning and Happiness.  The book was written with an eye towards those who had “made it.”  Wealth, check.  Family, check.  Job/retirement, check.  It was there for the “Why do I still feel unsatisfied?” and the “What do I do now?”  My big take aways were eudamonia (which was basically described as being “in the zone” such that hours pass unnoticed), opt for the middle path, and scholarly pursuits are the best path to happiness (as knowledge is it’s own reward).  For many years the book resonated with my thinking and guided me, but it also never quite hit the nail on the head either.  A lot of it really was predicated on having already attained a certain level of comfort.  Being young and poor, I had not been comfortable yet.  \n\nIn my late 20’s I took an EMT class that began my new career and primordially to stoicism.  For years I worked at a lousy company that didn’t really make me better or more knowledgable in my chosen profession; in fact, I left worse then when I had been freshly trained as a paramedic.  But part of the responsibilities of a medical provider is to keep up on the most current research and trends in the industry.  I would study journals, occasionally submit things for the benefit of others in the company newsletter, and I would listen to podcasts that were science based.  In my line of work there are an endless supply of stories of anecdotal evidence, that means very little to me.  I require evidence-based medicine.  And everyone who has been treated by a doctor, nurse, PA, or a paramedic, should demand that standard.  As evidence based became more important, I began to find myself drifting towards the Skeptic movement.\n\nThe Skeptics (not to be confused with their ancient counterparts) believe that belief in a given topic should be commiserate to the evidence supporting it.  If there is a big foot, why doesn’t anyone ever step in big foot poop? If acupuncture is so good, why can a random untrained person get similar results to an “experienced” provider?  This was also the final push from agnosticism to atheism.  I do not believe in the supernatural.  No ghosts, no gods, no fate, no magic.  Neil Degrasse Tyson was a godsend in that time, because he made the natural world compete with a supernatural one in terms of awe and wonder.  \n\nBut it all lacked a bit.  Its my belief that ethics are more important than advancing science. We may never know exactly what constitutes sentience, but we need to be prepared to ask and fumblingly answer these questions before it is too late.  Science goes slow, but then seems accelerates when no one is ready.  Will we breed an animal or build a robot that will force us to redefine humanity?  Will we feel just if we simply define things as DNA, or some other cheat that allows us to dodge the tough questions?  But on a smaller scaler, I didn’t have a code of ethics or morals.  Or at least the ethical rebar to help make the “right” and not “good” decision.  \n\nOne day in April 2015, I listened to an interview with noted Skeptic activist, Massimo Pigliucci.  He discussed his interest in Stoicism and it immediately caught my attention.  I began to devour podcasts, books, and articles about Stoicism.  What made it bizarre and feel right at home was that so many of the ideas were similar to thoughts and approaches I had when I was younger; ideas that I’d forgotten as I became invested in my comfortable bed and my comfortable relationships.  To date I have read, Stoicism and the Art of Happiness, Seneca the Younger: Complete Works, A Guide to the Good Life: The Ancient Art of Stoic Joy, and Musconius Rufus on How to Live.  I have also attended a few discussions of my local stoa, The Redwood Stoa.  \n\nWhat I’d like to take away from this course is a deeper understanding of philosophical underpinnings that feel eclipsed by ethics and the practical advice.  But most importantly, I’d like to feel better able to apply the principles and actual practices of Stoicism in my life.  To really take five minutes and attempt a form of mental maintenance.  As I’ve started work as a paramedic on the streets of San Francisco, I see all forms of human misery.  I would like a way to contextualize it.  Many techniques have already made a big difference in my approach to the job.  It makes helping those who can’s be helped, much easier.  It forgives the unfixable.   \n\nMost simply put, my arc looks like this\nCatholic»Boy Scout» EMT/Paramedic»Evidence based medicine»Skepticism»Atheism» Stoicism ', 1, '', 0, 0, 0, '', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', 0, 0, '', ''),

Thanks! - Marc Deshaies', 'Marc Deshaies SES Stoic Application Essay,  August 23, 2015\n\nPlease consider this application to the College of Stoic Philosophers, Stoic Essential Studies (SES) course. \n\nI am a 52 year old male. My occupation is Information Technology (IT) Manager. Some of the significant or guiding events in my life include earning an undergraduate engineering degree at the University of Notre Dame, a year spent traveling around the world in my 20s, living overseas in England for several years, and my life with my family. I live in Massachusetts, USA, near Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI). This past May, 2015, I finished a part-time Master’s Degree in IT at WPI. I am currently not attending any academic institution.  \n\nI have been interested in Stoicism since November of 2014, when my uncle introduced me to the Stoic Week 2014 program run by the same group that hosts modernstoicism.com. I found the ideas and practices of Stoic Week very intriguing. This past Spring, 2015, I also participated in the same organization’s Stoic Mindfulness and Resilience Training four-week course. After Stoic Week 2014, I bought William Irvine’s “A Guide to the Good Life”, read it cover-to-cover, and also have gone back to specific sections of it many times since, in both the print and combined audiobook & e-reader formats. My recent affiliation with WPI enabled me to check out fairly rare books on Stoicism from the college library, which enabled me to read a number of translations of the works of the Greek and Roman Stoics, along with academic commentary. While I do not think I have read any of these books cover to cover, I have read large portions of them. Recently I purchased print copies of the Enchiridion by Epictetus and Meditations by Marcus Aurelius, and plan to fill in the gaps by reading them cover-to-cover soon, preferably as part of this course.\nI have belonged to both the Roman Catholic church (since birth) and the Unitarian Universalist (UU) church (for the past several years), and regularly attend services at both. For the question of whether I consider myself an atheist, agnostic/skeptic, deist, or theist, is it Ok if I choose “none of the above”? Right now I think the “ism” that most closely aligns with my point of view is Pantheism. \n\nA few weeks ago, I led a summer service at my UU church, and I chose as my topic “Religion and Stoicism”. I spoke in front of a group of about 50 people on this topic, and my 15 minute sermon can be read online at http://www.firstunitarian.com/sermons.cfm or directly via  http://www.firstunitarian.com/files/DeShaiesStoicismReligionVirtueEquanimity07262015.pdf  The music I chose for this service was a rendering of “The Serenity Prayer”  (‘… grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change …’) attributed to Reinhold Niebuhr and recently set to music by Jack Bielan. This song and prayer epitomizes, for me, a central tenet of Stoicism: the dichotomy of control. The service also included a reference to discussions St. Paul had with Stoics and Epicureans from chapter 17 of the Acts of the Apostles from the Bible, which for me is an interesting overlap between the two religions that I practice. \n\nI have not studied philosophies other than Stoicism in depth. I do consider myself to be a practicing Stoic. However I am a bit wary of making that claim after hearing on your founder Erik Wiegardt’s interview on the Painted Porch podcast in March 2015 that a lot of the people he has encountered who claim to be Stoics do not have a clear understanding of what that means. So part of my motivation in applying is to get a solid grounding on the philosophy. That is what I want to get from this course: a systematic exposure to the main ideas of the Stoics in a program that emphasizes both theory and practice.\n\nMy learning so far on Stoicism has been heavily influenced by some online podcasts such as the Painted Porch mentioned above, a podcast  by Matt Van Natta called “The Immoderate Stoic”, work by Donald Robertson of England and Massimo Pigliucci of New York, and to a lesser extent by others such as  Tanner Campbell and Steven Umbrello. \nWhile I enjoy reading audio online, I am not very interested in using social media such as Facebook or Twitter, as my experience is that these communication forums are often very one-way, with plenty of people speaking and not many people listening. I would prefer a forum that involves more conversation and fewer monologues. Likewise, I remember reading that Thomas Jefferson was very careful choosing whether to engage in a conversation about religion with someone, as it usually accomplished very little, except with people of a temperament that was open-minded enough to consider and be respectful of others’ points of view. Recognizing that Stoicism is a philosophy, not a religion, I would also like to approach discussions of Stoicism with caution. Despite my recent sermon on the topic, I intend to practice Stoicism more than talking about it, and I would prefer to only engage in dialogue about Stoicism with someone who I think could converse with an open mind. Religion and Philosophy are deep topics, are important, and should not be treated just superficially. \n\nWhile my formal interest in Stoicism has only begun in the past 12 months, some aspects of the philosophy have been part of my makeup for much longer. While I consider myself an optimist, thinking of how things could be much worse has often been my approach to adversity in the past. I also for some time have believed that intentionally experiencing hardship builds character. At least since the time I was first introduced to the concept of “Locus of Control” in an undergraduate Introduction to Psychology course, I have identified with the dichotomy of control which separates things that are under my control from things outside my control.  \n\nThe SES reading list and assignments look intriguing. I am glad that the curriculum starts with a modern treatment of the subject then focuses on original source material of the Roman Stoics. I look forward to approaching the academic subject this way, and more importantly, applying what I have learned with the assistance of a Mentor, my own handbook, and mneme.\n', 1, '', 0, 0, 0, '', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', 1, 0, '', ''),

Below is a brief biographic sketch of myself.\n\nI am currently working in the healthcare (medical device and pharma) recruitment industry in Japan.  My work background is working within disability recruitment in Australia; I used to work for the federal government in return to work programs.  I’m of Irish/German Australian descent and have would describe myself as independent, intellectual, introverted, confident and motivated.  I’m married but I don’t have children, have been happily married for about 6 years.  My interests include running, reading, movies and meditation ( I am a long time practitioner of Mahasati Meditation).  I grew up in Queensland Australia and have worked in a lot of different industries including hospitality, sales, recruitment, counselling and disability.  I don’t feel like I have accomplished anything major in my life career wise, probably I helped a lot of people find jobs who would not have been able to do but that’s about it.  At university I did a dual degree in Commerce (majoring in human resource management) and psychology.  I’m naturally interested in people and have read hundreds of books on psychology, philosophy, history etc, random reading while growing up, as I was bookish and an only child, so I had plenty of time to read.  Honestly my childhood was difficult, I experienced a lot of conflict in my family and struggled with feelings of anxiety and depression through a lot of my childhood and teenage years. Also I was a Carer for my former partner, who suffered from chronic pain and had over 20 operations.  I looked after her while I studied and it was also a fairly dark time in my life as I struggled with the daily issues of caring for a person with a chronic illness.  These experiences were difficult but they also gave me insight and toughened me up long term.      \n\nMy parents were unconventional, my father was a die hard atheist and I was raised on the philosophy of Ayn Rand’s objectivism, which has a strong Aristotelian approach.  I don’t have any particularly strong religious convictions but have experimented with different practical exercises from Buddhism and the esoteric with varying results.  I would probably describe myself as an agnostic with gnostic leanings, I think that religion is useful to give people motivation to live their life fully and shape them towards moral behavior provided that it isn’t fanatical in any way.  I probably consider myself a bit of a lone wolf and also a doubting Thomas, I don’t go in for any kind of organized religious membership.  I have studied many philosophical systems, especially German philosophy and rational secular humanism systems of philosophy, hedonism etc.  While they were interesting I didn’t find they had the practical benefit of stoic philosophy.  I am very interested in the history of philosophy and religion, how it shapes society and the individual.  While this is very interesting it\'s not so practical and is more of a hobby, this is not what I seek from my involvement in your organization.   \n\n\nMy experience with stoic philosophy;  I read Meditations by Marcus Aurelius about 3 years ago and recently I have studied the online course at www.thestoiclife.org, a short interactive course that involves a lot of exercises and reflections.  Even though I have only applied stoic ideas for a short amount of time, I would consider myself a stoic.  While doing the course I mentioned, I experienced a major increase in wellbeing and feelings of happiness, it’s just a very logical way to look at the universe and I think an honest philosophy (by focusing on what we do and do not control).  Probably you could also say I have experience working with mindfulness from my Buddhist studies, which seems to form a large part of stoic practice, the idea of paying attention to your experience rather than the past or the future.   \n\nWhat I would like to gain from the course is an improvement in my character, increased feelings of serenity and happiness plus an overall purpose to my life.  The thing that struck me about stoic philosophy is that making improvements in your character is entirely within your control and has knock on effects that contribute to your whole life plus larger society.  This is what I would like.  I guess the quantifiable charges I would like to make would be to gain control over my bad temper and become a more tempered/balanced person in my thinking and outlook towards others.  Also I would like to cultivate more detachment to the ups and downs of life.  I am committed to my relationship with my wife and hopefully to becoming a father in the future, so I’d like to change myself to become the kind of parent and partner I’d like to be.  Also this may sound strange but I’d like to become more accepting of death generally I have noticed that death denial forms a large part of the hedonism that runs rampant in our society and I would like to face and overcome these feelings in myself.  I’d like to also gain generally more awareness of myself and my habits.  One thing I got from my reading of the esoteric is the idea that we live our life in a kind of sleep, philosophy is a practice (like meditation practice) that I think has the capacity to wake us up from our slumber, this is what I really want more than anything, the feeling of aliveness.  Another thing I would like is learn to be free of my regrets regarding the past and put things behind me.  In terms of other people, I would like to be a part of a group that are involved in the practical application of stoic ideas to life and would like to long term both be a student as well as contribute to the learning of others.  I think that what I have read about your organization is very positive because it represents an attempt to bring back practice which is something the world really needs.

After some lackadaisical explorations, I’m still without a religion to call home. I dabbled with Christianity in my adolescence, and developed the kind of naive practice you absorb from your friends and whose underpinnings you subject to very little scrutiny.\n\nThroughout high school, my friends and I eased into a habit of philosophical discussion, which led me to take a philosophy class my freshman year of college. When we read Hume’s Dialogues, specifically, the section on the problem of evil, I jettisoned my theism and have not looked back. As Tolstoy says, the effect of these arguments was like a finger pressing on a wall that was ready to tip over under its own weight. It wasn’t difficult, as I recall, to go from a half-faith to non-faith. In fact, a secular humanism rushed in to fill the void anad I was invigorated by a worldview that, I felt, was at least the result of some honest investigation.\n\nToday I would call myself an atheist because I deny the existence of what most people mean by “God.” I am still confident that the amount of apparently unnecessarily suffering in the world is strong evidence against the existence of that kind of God. The kind of God that would create a world like this and allow it to go on the way it goes on, with the power and knowledge the stop it, is not a god worthy of worship, or worthy of the honorifics we shower on Him—just, loving, and on and on. (On a related note, I anticipate it will be difficult for me to accept the Stoic idea of a conscious, providential cosmos, and I expect it will require a significant revision of my understandings of both consciousness and providence. I imagine the idea would be comforting if I could authentically internalize it. I hope that my studies could help in that regard.)\n\nBut in straying from theism, you jettison not just a set of propositional beliefs. You lose a readymade community of support and fellowship. You lose a framework for converting experience into meaning that has been benefitted from thousands of years of refinement from other humans. You lose an orientation toward the world, a fundamental attitude toward your own being and your relations to others. Many atheists fail to realize this until some time later when they find themselves mired in angst. I realized only recently that atheists must work actively to posit a structure of meaning in the place of the traditions, rituals, and cultural inheritance they forego.\n\nThere is a large body of humanist literature and philosophy to fill that gap, but systematic treatments and holistic worldviews are difficult to find, especially ones that don’t reek of quackery, or ones that can’t be found in the “Metaphysics” section of a Barnes & Noble.\n\nIt was one of the most reassuring revelations of my undergraduate experience that the “human condition” is a milieu of finite types of experiences and thoughts that is common to humans everywhere through all times. But after reading through the classic existentialists and their contemporary analytic counterparts, I’m still unmoored in the world. My problem may still be an obstinate attachment to naturalism that is difficult to square with any transcendent value.\n\nAfter my BA in philosophy, I earned a PhD in August 2014 from the University of Colorado. It may be that, thus steeped in the contemporary Western analytic tradition, I have overfed my rational part to the detriment of my spiritual and emotional parts. It is only recently that I have appreciated that there are truths that cannot be grasped by the intellect alone, and that the heart has reasons of which reason knows nothing (Pascal).\n\nAt a New Year’s Party several years ago, a friend of mine turned me on to Epictetus. I read the Enchiridion, then the Meditations (and Marcus’s correspondence with Fronto), Seneca’s Letters (those excerpted by Penguin), On the Shortness of Life, and his Consolations to Helvetia, the Discourses, and William Irvine’s Guide to the Good Life. I was enrapt. It was while reading Seneca that I was convinced to propose to my then-girlfriend, now wife. We must match time’s swiftness with our speed in using it, as though we were drinking from a fast-flowing stream that we knew would not always flow. We read that passage during our ceremony.\n\nAnd while I applied Stoicism with a clumsy and heavy hand at first, I knew that there was something that resonated with me. Martha Nussbaum provided my favorite definition of philosophy: philosophy is the use of reason and argument to improve human life. Stoicism was a lionization of rationality in the service of human flourishing, and I was intoxicated by the comforts it promised.\n\nI would know better than to call myself a Stoic—that’s a title that should be reserved, I think, for people who have a superior command of their thoughts and feelings.\n\nI had an professor when I was an undergraduate that said that we go through three stages when reading philosophy: The first time we read it, we think we understand it. When we return to it, we understand none of it. And it is only on studying a passage the third time that we truly understand what is being communicated. I consider myself to be in the second stage of my Stoic studies: I’m not sure what it means to live in accordance with nature; I’m not sure why I should think the cosmos is conscious and providential; I’m not sure what it means to live every day as if it were my last. I am hoping to progress to the third stage of my studies.\n\nMy relationship with Stoicism has been a series of revelations: that reason and introspection could promise to reveal and then extirpate the source of unpleasant emotions; that Stoics are allowed to have emotional responses to the circumstances of life; and finally, that to wring the full value out of Stoicism requires the dedication, focus, and ritual of any religious system. That’s why I’m here. Through this program of study, I hope to gain a scaffolding under the ethics of Stoicism. I am confident that a grounding in logic and physics will help—learning Stoicism as we are meant to. I also hope to gain a deeper understanding for the wonderful one-liners that I have no trouble conjuring, but fail to grasp with my whole being.', 1, '', 0, 0, 0, '', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 'Ryan completed term 3 but did not commence term 4.

I did notice that one of the conditions of enrollment in your program is that the prospective student not currently be "attending any academic institution"; I\'m assuming that since I\'m not enrolled at CWU (not even as an auditor), sitting in on a class would not disqualify my application; and that following a MOOC would not aggravate my case.  If I\'m mistaken in that, please let me know.', 'I was born in Winston-Salem, NC (USA) on 12 December 1947 (and however little account I take of astrological signs, I have all the traits of a Sagittarius), raised as a typical middle-class Southern WASP in a moderately high Episcopal church, the third child (and first son) to an overly strict father (afraid I might not bring honor to the male line) and an overly conforming mother.  I was a serious kid, well behaved and studious.  I loved school and books, but I never could mix much with my peers.  Even though I went along with (and was moderately successful in) many of the required activities, like little-league football and church choir, I never really fit in; but it wasn\'t until my early teens that I began to revolt.  By that time, I understood that I could never follow the life-plan that was projected for me (college, career, marriage, children), and that I could never play the role (or think the thoughts) scripted for me in the Jim Crow South.  My parents were just as confused about how to raise me as I was about growing up, and we all muddled through a series of now-comical failures (like my attending a private school for a year, that caused me to fall back a grade: me, the model student) until I finally dropped out in earnest and left home for good, at 19.\n\nI lived like a hermit for a year or so, working my way north at menial jobs from town to town, and decided (having just turned 21) to take a vacation in Europe.  (Money was never a problem: I just didn\'t spend any.)  I had never been outside the USA, and when I stepped out into the Old World, I felt I was home.  I ended up staying overseas (mostly France, Switzerland, and Algeria) for about 12 years.  I did virtually all of my university work in France.  I chose philosophy as my subject, even though I had had almost no exposure before then, and had no idea, really, what to expect.  From the very first, I was hooked for life: I had found a place where I could live (Europe), and a work I could pursue (philosophy).  Things went well for a while, but when it was time to begin a PhD dissertation, I faltered: I could not find an adviser I wanted to work with, and philosophy in the universities was beginning to feel dead, and (worse yet) deadening.\n\nBeing a total academic at heart (or perhaps "bookworm" would be a better word for it, even though I don\'t read much, volume-wise, because I\'m a slow reader, and lazy), I wanted to continue my studies, but I could see no opportunities in France.  I love literature as philosophy, so I got the disastrous idea that I could easily get into a graduate program in French in the USA, and pursue philosophy by other means.  Unfortunately, it was all too easy, and I ended up coming back to the USA in 1982.  That was surely one of the biggest blunders of my adult (?) life, and shows just how little I knew myself.  The experiment was a total failure, and left me somewhat stranded on this side of the Atlantic, as miserable and helpless as a wet cat.  I did manage to escape the USA for a year, by moving with my brother to Toronto, but the continuity of my studies had been broken, and I was not finding a way to pick them up again:  "I was doing nothing but scribbling a little poetry in my diary," so to speak (as André says in _My Dinner with André_, one of my all-time favorite films).\n\nThose years were a kind of personal wasteland, characterized by two failed marriages (yet another indication of how little I knew myself, I who had--from childhood, no less--resolved never to marry).  I did manage, however, to get into Recovery (in Minnesota, interestingly enough), in 1990.\n\nThe Twelve Steps were a revelation to me, and marked the beginning of the rest of my life.  My main program turned out to be Al-Anon.  In this program I found--and picked up--the thread of my studies, practicing them (steps and studies) wherever I went, and finding everywhere groups of people intent on the same practice, even if without the academic superstructure (so to speak).  In 2003 I encountered the Bodhisattva Peace Training, which turned out to be, for me, a kind of Twelve-Step program on steroids.  The many principles of the Buddhism I was exposed to through this Training (adapted from the Nyigma branch of Tibetan Buddhism) were to me the best expression I could imagine of the ideals capable of guiding me to a life worth living.  I learned much from the years I spent associated with the Peace Training (including a few years living and working at Iron Knot Ranch, the Buddhist retreat center where the Training is based), but I could not make a life in that context, mainly because the Training seemed insufficiently adapted to the general Western community that I identified with, and felt drawn to.  In 2010 I began my own search (so to speak) for an expression of the life principles I had learned through Recovery and the BPT that would fit my sense of the Western mind-set.  The project for me was--and is--not unlike that realized by Stephen Batchelor in _Buddhism without Beliefs_: I was looking for a way to formulate something like Authentic Western Spirituality without Beliefs, something I could believe in without beliefs.\n\nI was making very irregular progress (partly because in my life at that time too much was going on for my little brain) until one day, perhaps three years ago, I happened upon Pierre Hadot\'s _Philosophy as a Way of Life_.  I felt Hadot gave me the direction and encouragement I needed, and I returned (in a manner of speaking) to philosophy, understood now explicitly as something entirely other than the academic discipline I had more or less given up on.  I resolved to return to the Ancients (though I had never left Socrates, my greatest inspiration and love), but took no real steps in that direction until about a year ago, when I happened upon the "two handles" of Epictetus (_Enchiridion_ 43): I knew at once that I had found a Western tradition (and author) that might provide the context I needed for developing a Western practice leading to a meaningful life.  My personal work has centered since then on Epictetus, even though I have made relatively little progress up to now (I still haven\'t finished my first reading of his works), mainly because my living has been so unsettled.  I haven\'t read much on Stoicism beyond Epictetus: only some Marcus Aurelius, some Seneca, and _A Guide to the Good Life_ (Irvine).  My current plan is to study the Stoics as much as I can, and adapt their teachings to a daily practice that I can pursue.  Discovering your College was momentous, for me: a community engaged in practicing Stoicism and supporting it in others!  What a treasure!\n\n"Do you believe in God, Dr. Arroway?"  This is one of the many moments in the film _Contact_ that fascinate me (and that used to infuriate me, I\'m sorry to say, because the film--to my way of thinking--mishandles the religion and science issue).  It\'s one of those impossible questions, like the proverbial "When did you stop torturing little animals?" (or whatever).  I don\'t belong to any religious faith; I don\'t even think of myself as Christian, even though I participated in church-going for the first 16 years of my life, and never really felt the need to repudiate anything in it (other than the usual suspects: hypocrisy and violence; but Christianity has no monopoly on either).  But I don\'t think of myself as an atheist, either (especially in today\'s climate): Agnosticism feels more suited, but it sounds misleading.  Nor could I say I\'m a Stoic.  I recently encountered a label that I\'m trying on for size, and in many ways it seems to fit better than anything I\'ve encountered before: I just might be a faitheist (Chris Stedman).  What it comes down to, for me, is that I do indeed believe, but without beliefs (and certainly without any religion): I believe in the universal good (or the idea of the good, as Socrates expresses it in Book VI of Plato\'s _Republic_; and as chance would have it, the class I\'m sitting in on is up to this Book, and the image of the sun is on the program for today, 13 October 2015), and in my responsibility to conform and contribute to it.  If one day we in the English-speaking world come up with a label that updates pantheism on the foundation of radical evolutionism and emptiness (to use the standard Buddhist term), then perhaps I could apply that label to myself.  (It could be that C. S. Peirce\'s notion of evolution contains the required meaning, but I\'m not familiar enough with his thought to know.)\n\nBeing a life-long student of philosophy, I\'ve studied a number of philosophies and philosophers.   Plato is my all-time favorite philosophy author (primarily for his portrayal of the character Socrates).  Kant would be second (a position soon to be shared, perhaps, with Epictetus).  Marx and Hegel are perennial inspirations.  I have spent considerable time and energy on Aristotle and Descartes, but for the most part I have not found much inspiration in their works.  Buddhist thought (mainly in the Madhyamaka-Prasangika school) has been a major source of inspiration a study for the last ten years, in particular works like _The Way of the Bodhisattva_.  One relatively minor figure who has been important for me is Bernard Loomer.  I have had relatively little exposure to analytic philosophy or philosophers.  Over the years I have focused more and more on the practical (or ethical) import of what I read, and if I am not able to draw from a work something of value in my pursuit of the common good, then I drop it and move on.  Authors like Kierkegaard and Nietzsche, for example, or even Heidegger and Levinas, I simply can no longer read on my own: I have no more time to spend trying to extract from their works something of lasting value in my living.  (Something like _Process and Reality_ would be of great interest to me if I had encountered it thirty years ago, but "I ain\'t got time for that now," as the Talking Heads say in "Life during Wartime").  This is not to say that I judge their work negatively: if I can find little of value in it, that\'s my failing, not theirs.  Finally, my favorite contemporary (hands down) is Zizek, above all for his analysis of western ideology and his energetic counter-stance (at least in his public works).\n\nI\'m hoping your SES course will further my understanding of the principles of Stoicism, and help me adapt them to my own life, as I learn more about how others apply them to theirs.  I look for mutual support and encouragement in the practice, and for an introduction into a community of practitioners.  I hope I can continue this work by following the Marcus Aurelius course.  And my final aspiration (for the moment, and in this regard) would be to help others like me find their own way in a contemporary practice of Stoicism.', 1, '', 0, 0, 0, '', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', 0, 0, '', ''),

I am agnostic, and I am not a member of any religious faith. I was born and raised in Brittany, and I have been living in New York City for the past 9 years. I have been an active professional musician since 1995, and my career is now based in New York City.\nI was first introduced to philosophy during my last year of high school when we had to complete a set of core philosophy classes weekly. The study of philosophy in France has a core role in secondary education. In “terminale” – the last year of high school – it is a compulsory subject for all students. Those studying humanities or languages have to do eight hours of philosophy a week and the subject has always sparked my interest as my mother had introduced me to a few philosophical authors like Albert Camus, Voltaire, or Jean-Paul Sartre.  For as long as I can remember, I have been fascinated by the idea of developing a capacity for personal reflection.\nMy major in College was English Language and Literature. I studied 2 years at the University of Rennes, and there I was allowed to also follow an introductory course to philosophy through topics found in classical writings such as the humanism, mind and body, right and wrong... \nDuring my second year of college, my best friend passed away tragically. I was devastated and I started to question myself about the meaning of life, our purpose as human being and about death. I decided to quit my studies at the university and made the choice to finish my studies at the National Conservatory of Music of Rennes. Of Reunion Island and French West Indies ancestry, I began performing Gwo-ka music (from Guadeloupe) at an early age with my family-based troupe in France. Music had always been in my life and playing an instrument and singing felt like the most healing art form at the time to deal with my loss. After earning my music degree, I had the choice to either immediately pursue and start a career as a freelance musician in France or travel to Spain and Cuba. I chose the informal education of traveling and I believe I learned more hence broaden my experiences in those settings.\nI have been a freelance musician and a French teacher since then.\n\nI have been interested in stoic philosophy for a year. A year ago, I started doing some cognitive behavioral therapy sessions and my research brought me to cross some articles about Stoicism. I found myself reading more and more about this ancient philosophy online and excerpts of Aurelius’ meditations, Epictetus’ Enchiridion, or Seneca’s On Anger quickly brought me to the conclusion that a combination of philosophy and psychology seems to be a right response to our contemporary problems. Continuing my researches, I have been watching many videos of Albert Ellis, Paul Stearns, and Jules Evans. Real value being virtue; emotions being the product of our judgments about events in our life; living in harmony with nature; the stoic technique of the maxim; the idea of cosmopolitanism; seeing all adversity as a practice…those notions are fascinating to me and seem to be the answer to our everyday struggles as human being.\n\nNo, I am not a stoic. I am not a stoic yet. I have been practicing, and I want the knowledge to become one. I want to get the tools to handle life’s challenges and become a better person. I have come to one of this point in life when I am eager to engage in broader reflection about my / our purpose, who I am and what I am doing. I have reached the willingness to connect with my own wisdom, confidence, and strength through an everyday practice and through working with the discomfort, the bad feelings and the insecurities, instead of going for the short-term relief (to numb out, to be aggressive or to seek for comfort pleasure). Always trying to find zones of safety, in the continuum of not acknowledging our emotions, seems to create our suffering and our weakening, without addressing the roots of the problems. We become distant with our own truth and nurse the fantasy of a certain authenticity. We grow more intimate with the distance of our own emotions, avoiding the emergence our underlying psychological issues and limitations.\nAccording to Aristotle, a flourishing soul was one in the habit of virtuous acts. \nHabits are powerful and all adversity is training and virtue is sufficient for happiness. I have been living without noticing that moral character plays a great role in whether we like someone or not. During obituaries for instance, we more frequently mention virtues than talents or achievements. Virtue is an identity detector and the essence of our character. Practicing virtue is a necessary act to attract what may have been missing in our life such as fulfilling relationships, achievement of meaningful goals, and happiness. \nWe know all of these notions yet we tend to move inward, to be self-absorbed and cling to the things and behavior that make us suffer. We do have a hard time staying present and fear makes us cling to what we know, however bad it makes us feel.  Stoicism brings the idea that we are so forgetful human beings, we need to repeat ideas over and over again until those ideas become ingrained habits, until we reach the wisdom to be present and acknowledge our feelings and most importantly the thoughts causing the feelings, until we become our personal best, until we “Know thyself”. But what is to “know oneself”? Beneath the career ambitions, the memories of the past, the pragmatic goals, the denial, “we find a constellation of moral capacities”.\n\nPracticing mindfulness, accepting the things we can\'t change, and regulating negative emotions: goals towards our own rewards and healing.\n\n“What, then, is to be done?

I was born in Germany where my father (an enlisted man in the Air Force at the time) and my Irish mother (who went to Germany to find work) met and married.  I spent my childhood years in New Jersey, my teenage and young adult years in Delaware and moved to Maryland 20 years ago.\n\n	I met my wife in law school and have been happily married to that wonderful woman for 22 years.  I have 3 biological children – an 18 year-old daughter (freshman in college), a 16 year-old son (High School senior) and a 14 year-old son (High School sophomore).  My wife and I also have a 22 year-old daughter who joined our family 10 years ago when we adopted her from Russia. She was and is quite a challenge, although she is now out-of-the–house and living on her own.\n\n        We live in a fairly typical suburban development and have spent the bulk of the last 20 years focused on simply raising a family.  My wife recently returned to the practice of law herself, hanging up a shingle and starting a solo practice.\n\n	I graduated from Bucknell University in 1988 with a BA in Economics and Political Science. I then went to DePaul Law School in Chicago and have practiced law ever since.  My practice is concentrated on the defense of shareholder litigation. My career has been a demanding one, with long hours, high-stress and little control over my schedule.  But I enjoy the intellectual challenge of the practice of law.  \n        Although I dabbled in beer-making and chili-pepper growing in earlier years, I haven’t had much time for hobbies or outside interests.  Rather, for the last 25 years I have spent my time either at work or raising children.  I probably logged several thousand hours over the years on fields watching my kids play soccer, lacrosse, etc.  The only outside activity I’ve really had is reading.\n\n\n\nMy interest in philosophy\n\n	When I was a freshman in college, I was introduced to Plato’s Republic. It captivated me.  At that time in my life, I was focused on practical reality -- getting a job, starting a career, etc.  Philosophy seemed to have no place in the world I was seeking to construct for myself.  Nevertheless, I found myself returning to Plato many times over the ensuing years and I eventually read all of his dialogues.  Some of them (the Republic, the Apology, Symposium) I read multiple times.  I gradually branched out and became acquainted with other philosophers and philosophies, assisted by a wide variety of survey courses offered by the Teaching Company.  These audio-tape lectures became a regular way for me to spend my morning commute.\n\n My reading was diverse, unstructured and varied in intensity over the course of time depending on what else was going on in my life.  I found the pre-socratics interesting, but of little practical relevance. Aristotle was dreadfully dry and I could never warm up to him no matter how hard I tried to convince myself that I should read him.  The neo-platonists were impenetrable.  Augustine and Boethius became favorites.  Aquinas and Anselm were a chore. Political philosophers like Machiavelli, Hobbes, Locke and Rousseau interested me, although I don’t think I ever re-read anything after reading it once.  More “serious” philosophers like Kant and Wittgenstein were largely beyond me. Nietsche disturbed me.  Modern philosophers were useful primarily as a cure for insomnia. In sum, although I have been reading philosophy for 30 years, it has always been in a random and casual way without any organization or teacher.      \n\n\n\nMy interest in stoicism\n\n	About a year ago, I purchased a course from the teaching company discussing the “Greco-Roman moralists.”  As part of this course, I had my first real introduction to stoicism. The instructor had been heavily influenced by Epictetus, and I became curious.  I found myself reading a little Epictetus, as well as some of Seneca’s writings.  I also purchased a book by William Irvine entitled “A Guide to the Good Life: The Ancient Art of Stoic Joy.”    Collectively, these materials led me to realize my fundamental frustration with philosophy in general and Platonism in particular – it didn’t seem to have much to say about how to actually live life on an everyday basis.  Plato is wonderful for helping us see the sloppy thinking that infects many of our most basic assumptions, but he doesn’t really help when it comes to practical questions.  More generally, reading philosophy satisfied an intellectual interest, but it didn’t have much impact on my life as such.  \n\n      Stoicism seems radically different  -- at least based on my limited and superficial reading thus far.  It distinguishes the important from the unimportant for the very purpose of practically helping one achieve a fulfilling and worthwhile life.  For example, the suggestions Seneca gives for addressing anger and grief are like nothing one will find in most philosophy.\n\n	I do not know if I could accurately describe myself as a stoic.  But much of what I have read thus far seems right to me.  I want to learn more. And I want to do it in a consistent and disciplined way.  That is what caused me to start perusing the internet looking for a distance-learning course. And that is what led me to this course.\n\n	    \nThe religious question\n\n	I read the discussion on the website stressing this group’s “big tent” views to religion: “All Stoics are pantheists, because Nature is our god, literally, but you can be an atheist or a deist or an agnostic and still be a Stoic in good standing.”\n\n	I am not an atheist or a deist or an agnostic.  I was raised a Catholic and remain a practicing one. But although I practice a revealed religion, I have always believed that we were given reason for a purpose, and that God intended us to use our reason to handle life’s problems. And candidly, although I have never left Catholicism, I have often found myself questioning and scrutinizing its core beliefs. I’ve always believed that anyone who doesn’t critically examine his beliefs from time-to-time is either a child or a fool. In short, I have never accepted that faith and reason need be incompatible – at least for most of the things that matter. I also find a great deal of overlap between many principles of Christianity and stoicism (e.g., rejection of the mindless consumerism that drives most of our society). So, if you are willing to stretch your tent a little further, I would like to be instructed further in stoicism.\n\nI look forward to hearing from you.\n\nBest,\nScott\n', 1, '', 0, 0, 0, '', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 'Scott didn\'t finish his ethics term in the Spring of 2017', '', 0, 0, '', ''),

When we are asked who we are we normally state our name and our occupation. Perhaps you are married and you have children. You may even have a nice house or drive a good car, but here it clearly becomes slippery: is that who you are? But from a more practical perspective, we have to make a start somewhere so let’s begin even though I believe that it will just be scratching the surface. \n\nMy name is Quirijn Kolff. I am an entrepreneur in Amsterdam, The Netherlands. I am married and have three children. I was born in Haarlem, The Netherlands in 1970 and grew up in a nice suburban neighborhood where I enjoyed school. At the age of 19 I joined the Dutch Army and after that I decided to study Law at the University of Amsterdam. \n\nSo far so good. My first real change from an otherwise standard upbringing (for Dutch standards that is) happened in 1995 when I learned about the possibility to obtain a Masters Degree in Taxation (my field of study within the Law) in New York at the New York University, School of Law. It was hard to get in and I had to work like an animal to finish my Dutch studies on time, but I made it and in August of 1996 I moved to the US. Little did I know at the time that this decision would alter my life significantly. \n\nAfter my studies I started working in the Big Apple at one of the Big 4 accounting firms. More importantly, through some joined friends, I met my now wife of 15 years Nancy. She is a born New Yorker but from immigrant Spanish parents. With our similar European background and upbringing we instantly clicked and we married soon after. Together we lived in New York, we moved to Madrid for a job within my firm, we moved back to the New York suburbs to run Nancy’s late father’s business and finally moved to The Netherlands in 2011. It was again for a job that we made this last move but also because we felt that The Netherlands was the best place to raise our kids. During our busy years moving from place to place our family situation had changed as Nancy gave birth to my three sons: Michael (2003); Jamie (2004); and Oliver (2008). \n\nDuring my more mature years, and in between changing diapers, I became interested in reading and studying about what Life was all about. I was raised Christian but would call myself an atheist if I had to choose a label. From that time in my twenties I remember reading Paulo Coelho but also Tony Robbins and Dale Carnegie. I even tried reading Plato’s Republic (in which I did not succeed but the book still looks impressive on the bookshelf). In my search for meaning I went from Joel Osteen to Eckard Tolle and back to the basics of Buddhism after seeing the Daila Lama speak in Central Park. Later I discovered Zen Buddhism via the audio tapes of the great Alan Watts. I also explored the Tao Te Ching and I was convinced I was making serious progress on my quest when I joined a weekly meditation group. How disappointing it was when I discovered that getting ahead in my “spiritual practice” actually meant I was not getting the point… \n\nI have been interested in the Stoics for a couple of years. I started reading more about philosophy as a Way of Life after discovering Alain de Botton. Through his books I learned about the different streams of Life Philosophies. Stoics, Cynics, Epicureans, but also Montaigne, Nietzsche, Schopenhauer and Spinoza. They are offer variations on a theme and it was an amazing discovery to see how many of the great philosophers actually discussed the art of living. I instantly connected to these bright minds and I have found it very worthwhile to study them. Why reinvent the wheel when one tries to figure what is important and what is not while living in the 21st century? This is what philosophy is all about, learning how to live. \n\nStudying ancient philosophy also very much fits my spiritual search. While the emphasis in philosophy may not so much be on reaching enlightenment or finding the divine it is very much qualified self-help to build character and be happier. What is good for Marcus Aurelius leading a Roman nation must surely be good for me. Moreover, from a spiritual angle, the God the Stoics believed in was in actuality Nature, in all its force. As we learn from the Stoics to take the events that happen to us as they are and not personal. This “religious” view is something I feel very comfortable with.\n\nI really connected to Stoicism this year after reading a NY Times article from professor Pigliuci. I decided to dig deeper and I connected to the Stoicon conference and the Stoic week. The one day seminar this month was quite amazing. Since I started reading on Stoic philosophy I have jumped from Epictetus Handbook, back to the Meditations and Seneca’s letters. I have quite a few books on the subject and my bed side table gives me plenty to choose from when I am ready to end my day. Particularly interesting I find the books on the subject by Pierre Hadot. The Inner Citadel is dense but offers invaluable insight into Marcus Aurelius’ work and the underlying structure of Stoicism. \n\nThe result? I try to live as a Stoic but often fail. However, it does give me much pleasure to try and use the Stoic philosophy as a guide for life: in search for virtue and to become a better person. I have found in Stoicism a philosophy where I can spend a lifetime of study. I also believe that Stoicism is a life philosophy that could be of help to many in today’s society. For me personally I look forward to further structuring my studies and be able not only to use the Stoic tools on a daily basis but to also explore how I can help others around me who could benefit from its suggested way of life. \n\nI would like to start with the SES course and if it is indeed what I hope it will be to move on to the Marcus Aurelius School.\n \nI look forward to your guidance. \n    \n', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, '', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', 0, 0, '', ''),

Eventually, I’d become more involved in the life of the Church, as a “server” (altar boy), and lectern (reader).  My experience with Catholicism was, for the most part, beneficial, as early on, I had gravitated toward its more “mystical” and philosophical elements—always asking “deeper” questions, that often the “authorities” could not answer….and, sometimes as a result, getting me into a little heretical hot water.  Later in life, I switched over to the Eastern Byzantine Rite of the Catholic Church (basically Eastern Orthodoxy in communion with Rome), and still regard myself as Catholic, though open to participating in either rite.\nIn fact, better to describe myself as “Catholic” in the literal sense of “Universal”, in that, my spiritual “core” so to speak, is likely most rooted in the “perennialist school”, as represented in part by figures such as Rene Guenon,  Dr. Seyyed Nasr, Frithjof Schuon, Heri Corbin, ad infinitum.  \n\n     Throughout my hectic and turbulent high school years, when my parents divorced, and the family economy collapsed, I had no notion of how to approach the future.  While, at one time, my thoughts had entertained a teaching career in theology and philosophy, that suddenly vaporized with a new reality of having to “go work” and for a modest and meager portion.  And, this I did, throughout many years as a young adult, until deciding to struggle getting by, while “going back to school”.\nInitially, upon my return, I wanted to do something in “science”, most especially biology, which was another interest of mine; but, after two years in, my philosophical side got the best of me again, and the pendulum swung back toward the notion of ending up as a teacher of theology and philosophy….and then, further changes occurred still.\n\n     While about to wrap up a B.A., I began a heavy investigation of Hermetism, and in particular, practical, medicinal, “lab alchemy” (mineral, metallic, and botanical medicines prepared according to Traditional models, aka "spagyrics").  During that time, and as something closely related, I proceeded through Blue Lodge and Scottish Rite Freemasonry, to the degree of 32.  Eventually, a rather brilliant Canadian physician, lab alchemist, and also fellow Mason, put forward the question: “Now that you can make all these botanical formula recipes, what are you going to do with them?  How is making them any good if you don’t know how to use them”?   What he meant, was that ultimately, the useful “alchemist” was a practicing physician….and so, off I went on another adventure into a “TCM”, or “Traditional Chinese Medicine” graduate school program, concluding with my practitioners’ license in these arts, and, with what I tend to feel when practicing these arts, a harmonious union of health care science, biology, psychology, and philosophy.  \n\n     As a result of everything surmised above, my fingers have always been in many philosophical pies, and still are.  But, where does Stoicism fit into all of this exactly?  I tend to think of myself presently as “Philostoic”, as opposed to Stoic, because, while I esteem (love) Stoicism, I’ve not ACCOMPLISHED Stoicism, and until I’m “good at” the practice(s), I’m little more than knowledgeable about abstract principles.  Thus, I’m approaching this academy, not as one desirous of merely increasing in “book smarts”; but, as one ready and willing to do some difficult, and perhaps even uncomfortable, mind and life changing “praxis”.  My familiarity with Greek, and Greco-Roman philosophy (up to this time), has primarily drawn upon Plato/Platonism, the “Middle Platonism” of Plotinus, and the “Neoplatonism” of Proclus et al.  Thereafter, having imbibed further in the extension, development, and inclusion of these teachings into Christianity, with attention to figures such as Augustine, Boethius, Gregory Nyssa, Bonaventura, the “pseudo” Denys, etc.  \nThree major influences upon my understanding of these Platonic/Platonic related schools, from contemporary authors, has been supplied by the works/exegesis of Dr. Algis Uzdavinys, Dr. Pierre Grimes, and Dr. Roger Sworder, who have, in my estimation, succeeded in teasing out some rather new, refreshing, “esoteric”, and at the very least, controversial interpretations of Plato and succeeding schools.\nIn more recent years, my attention turned more toward the pre-Socratic Eleatics, especially Parmenides and Empedocles.  These too, receiving a breath of fresh air, under the suggestions and guidance of Peter Kingsley.\n\n     Finally then, there is Stoicism, and, with which a bit of blushing, it must be admitted my experience is sorely limited.  Aside from The Emperor Aurelius’ “Meditations”, Seneca’s “Letters”, and snippets of “Enchiridion”, my readings consist mostly of secondary sources, such as online essays and journal articles.  Nonetheless, what I do know thus far, of the Stoic “path”, delineated by a “fourfold way” consisting of the study of logic, physics/cosmos, ethics, and prosoche, has “called out” to me for more serious attention, since first stumbling upon “Stoic Week” materials, two or three years ago.  \n\n     In conjunction with this, and really all the foregoing, the particularly theistic approach of “The College of Stoic Philosophers” seems to be the approach to this philosophy most suited to me own nature, as some version of a cosmic “Logos” has more or less accompanied all of my philosophical and theological pursuits.  Recalling my own Catholic roots, we only need reflect briefly, to observe for instance, the impact Greek thought has had on Christianity, when considering the prolegomenon of the Gospel of a Hellenized John the Evangelist, who imports Logos into his Gospel, with an additional consideration—that the incarnate Jesus is everything previously maintained concerning the Greek Logos—but now, there is likewise an individuality revealing its “face”.  Additionally, the particular cosmology/physics associated with this schools presentation of Stoicism, represents another working and familiar complement.  To put it in my own words, the manifest cosmos and nature, are not the “inanimate” matter they are as imagined by Darwinism—in other words, the coalescing, over time, of the materially “simple”, into the materially more “complex” forms, is not what “produces” consciousness; rather, akin to categories such as mass, density, volume, and weight, consciousness too,  is an already, inherently existing quality of matter.  \n\nIn conclusion, if accepted as a student, I look forward to learning externally, ripening interiorly, forging bonds of kinship, and, if within my destiny, humbly contributing something to this Tradition for yet another generation.\n', 1, '', 0, 0, 0, '', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', 1, 0, '', ''),

I was raised as a Lutheran protestant, although my family is not very religious.\n\nOnly-child, protected but also exposed to conflicts and discussions between my parents, which led to an early experience in mediation and a certain phobia to conflicts; basic school experience was very “seventies”, experimental (“set theory”, group work, hugging). Later on in High School I participated in several foreign exchange programs, first of all with fourteen years a 3 week stay in England near Brighton in a typical working class family; after several holiday stays I went for half a year to an English High School. Later an exchange with Calahorra in Spain and Niles West High School in a suburb of Chicago followed. My first love was the American girl from the exchange program, I gained a taste of the "easy life".\n\nNever any good in sports otherwise top of the class, I graduated with the highest possible grade point average in 1987, main subjects were Mathmatics, German Languague, Physics and History. Interest in arts, not opposed but little talent for music.\n\nMy stay in England and the last three years in high school, especially after repeating 1 year because of mentioned foreign stays were characterized by and opening to new friends, new experiences, first encounters with alcohol and the opposite sex, even incipient experiences with drugs (marihuana).\n\nStill in school I made plans to study environmental engineering, first mechanical or better process engineering, which in most German Universities (but not all of them, as I would later find out) requires practically the same undergraduate courses. The plan was to study until intermediate diploma closer to home and later on at RWTH Aachen, considered the best German Engineering School at the time. It was also in High School that the idea to work abroad, in a developing, maybe Spanish speaking country grew in my mind, maybe have my own company (like my father) and that idea apparently stuck as we will see later.\n \nThe following military service (15 months) was more of a shock, characterized by orders and narrowmindedness, physical requirements during basic training were difficult but more productive; the rest (although spent very close to my family’s home) simply boring and mostly frustrating. \n\nBetween 1988 and 1990 I studied Mechanical Engineering at the relatively new, small but reputated Technical University of Hamburg-Harburg, Northern Germany; I managed to finish Vordiplom, an intermediate grade among the first 6 students (of approximately 100) and one of the “better” grades, but with more difficulties, work and dedication than expected, things were still going according to plan. Student life was fun, although that of a typical engineering students, hardly any female students and only a couple.\n\nA second difficulty arose because of my desire to change to Chemical or Process Engineering (my original option had always been process engineering, but in RWTH Aachen, a different University), which was denied in spite of doing several additional courses; things did not go according to plan and that was a new experience, which me to change to University of Hannover, Process Engineering. A third difficulty which arose was an on-and-off relationship to a girl I knew through one of my best friends.\n\nMeanwhile I had applied and been conceded a Fulbright Scholarship; after spending two semesters in U Hannover (with a total of 6 semesters university) I was accepted in the Environmental Engineering Graduate Program of Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, where I graduated in December of 1992, with a Master of Science. In other words, the US University had recognized all my studies as equivalent to an undergraduate engineering course, since they included one more year in High School and three years in University, as well as two smaller thesis works required in Germany. I decided to have my M.Sc. degree recognized in Germany as an engineering diploma, instead of trying to validate individual courses and finish my German degree, which most certainly would have led to the same frustrations as earlier on. The “plan” was to later-on return to university and finish a doctoral degree.\n\nIn 1993 I worked in the south of Germany in a Sanitary Engineering company; however at the time my father was sick getting sicker and I decided to return to Hannover, where I spent the last half of a year with my family; having been chronically ill since I was 10 it was still surprising for me when he passed away, at 27 that was my first near experience with death and I was very impressed, shaken.\n\nThe last year I had been applying to work abroad, preferably in a Latin American country: For that same reason in the beginning of 1993 I did a trip to Chile in order to have some job interviews with environmental consultancy and engineering companies in Santiago. After my father died in February 1994 I stuck to that plan and started to work in a Chilean company in May that same year. In hindsight this might seem another escape “forward”, an escape also from a still on-and-off relationship with Claudia, the same women which later became my best friend’s girlfriend. She followed me once to Chile, but we later lost contact, like my friend who "suffered" some five or six years longer and finally broke up.\n\nIn Geotecnica Consultores (today Arcadis Chile) I rapidly made friends, the environmental team included engineers, cientists and lawyers, most of them my age; as well as several foreigners, including two Germans and one Australian. \nOur immediate boss was the wife of our other boss, and company owner, so the setting could be described as quite “familiar”, decisions and treatment however were not always appropriate. During my two years in the company I learned a lot on field work, report writing, “selling”, making proposals, however very early on decided I would have my own company and not depend “on orders from above”. During one of my projects I worked for USAID as a consultant for pollution prevention, other areas of expertise included water quality, waste water treatment and more and more solid waste management.\n\nAs soon as I was able to apply for permanent residence permit, I left the company and together with one of my German friends and colleagues, Andreas and a German Engineering company we founded a consultancy company, today called “Ingeniería Alemana S.A.”. The company, which started in my apartment and soon separated from our German associates, grew to about 20 people in the next ten years, a more professional management was necessary, especially because of differences in criteria between me and my remaining partner. We hired the other German ex-colleague, friend as well from our beginnings in Chile, he ran a very tight ship and the company started to “make money”. \n\nIt should be worth mentioning that working 60 hour weeks plus weekends started to cause the first burn-out symptoms, as well as attempts to “escape”: In 2001 and 2002 I went to Puerto Montt, following my very free spirited forth Chilean girlfriend Catalina, which is a “humanist” but in the Latin American tradition of Mario Rodriguez, called “Silo”. An interesting phylosophy, which however seems to deny it\'s classical roots, some of their teaching being very similar to stoicism.\n\nFirst very much infatuated, very much in love our relationship quickly became more complicated, a certain degree of violence on her part, my tendency to withdraw on the other hand; practical issues or the lack of concern for them on Catalina’s behalf added to our difficulties.\n\nIn 2003 my son Alonzo Dietrich Nikolaus (first name was chosen by his mother, the second name is my fathers and grandfathers) was born, already back in Santiago de Chile; the single most significant event of my adulthood. Our relationship improved; my “quasi”-wife Catalina (we never married because she wouldn’t out of principle) is an excellent mother, quite strict nevertheless, which proved to be a good education method in the case of our sun: We have no television, we do not eat junk, nor drink sugary beverages; our sun reads, talks, draws and from very early on had to accompany both of us to meetings, keep still and entertain himself.\n\nWe read German books together, sometimes we talk in German and he has visited his grandmother in Germany at least once per year since he was little; in school he has English, nowadays we regularly see TV-shows in the internet (in English and German), so I hope he will become fluent in both languages. \n\nIn 2005 I decided to return to University, do my doctoral degree at RWTH Aachen; I had everything planned, already rented an apartment for the three of us; then in February 2006 all of my plans went down the drain: In short, one of my colleagues and partners, Luis a Geologist died while working in the field, inexplicably he entered a sewer and suffocated from toxic gases (we think it was a suicide, the widow nevertheless sued us because we did not give him protective gear for a work he was not supposed to do); another friend, the Australian died in a helicopter crash that same month; I separated from Catalina and went alone to Germany, my remaining partner Andreas sued me in order to gain control of the company and, finally in 2007, our General Manager decided to go back to Germany with his family. In short, although I did spend some time at RWTH Aachen at the Department for Processing and Recycling of Solid Waste, I had to go back to Santiago permanently and did not finish my doctoral studies in Germany. \n\nNow a group of companies, IASA grew in number of people to more than 50 and also expanded to other fields of work, e.g. construction of sanitary works, closure of landfills, site clean-up, training and courses; in hindsight I probably surrounded myself with the wrong people, however it later became clear as well that my predecessor as General Manager had done very little to further autonomy in our “team”, really apart from a bunch of people who drink beer together after work, and call themselves “friends” (which I also did), there was no team.\n\nIn 2012 several of these friends embezzled the company in a construction projects, managed to gain the follow-up project themselves and left with a lot of unfinished work, unpaid bills, as well as suing the company. Things got difficult, projects got behind schedules, payments from public clients under the new government were made late, later or never; our company nearly went bankrupt, and if not only because bankruptcy is too expensive according to Chilean law.\n\nIt is in difficult times when you really know your friends, they are fewer than one thinks, and many times the most improbable characters; to describe 2013 and 2014 as “shitty years” would be a compliment, but with less people (20 again) and only the trusted ones we made it. \n\nI would have liked to be a stoic during this period, which I was not as shown by the amount of alcohol ingested and still consumed on a daily basis; however we learned some very similar lessons: “Things can always be worse”, “Judge a person, before calling him a friend”, “do the right thing, no matter” and the only thing that hurts about all of the insults, of being broke and “dishonored”, is one’s own perception of it. In practical terms, if had really believed I am a crook just because so many people told me, I would have sent everything to hell and saved a lot of money. Instead we made our stand, no more escape; we have since started to pay back an important part of the debt to our suppliers (the banks we sent to hell).\n\nFinally, and in order to answer some of the questions, “How long you have been interested in Stoicism”? Since school I have been interested in Greek history and philosophy, but I was not aware of the particulars of the stoic philosophy until recently, when I did some research on motivation for the company I work.\n\nThe sstoic books I have read are the following:\n1.	Letters to Lucilio, Seneca\n2.	On the shortness of Life, Seneca\n3.	Meditation, Marcus Aurelius\n\nAfter looking up the definition, I would consider myself a deist, since I am definitely no atheist, nor very fond of formal religion. However, I am still a Lutheran and my son was baptized (his mother could probably be described as agnostic, maybe a deist but I am not certain how much of what she says is belief and how much plain stubbornness).  \n\nThe only philosophy I have studied in High School were the classic Greek philosophers like Platon and Sokrates, as well as some modern philosophers (which I don´t recall); I already mentioned "Silo" and currently I am reading Kant’s “Critique of Practical Reason”.\n\nI cannot consider my-self a stoic because of the relatively short time I have tried to follow its philosophy; however I think that some concepts naturally coincide with my up-bringing, beliefs and tendencies: Although there’s nothing to have against certain luxuries (a good wine, a good meal, a nice holiday), I do not need them, nor depend on them. My up-bringing was very Prussian, protestant in the cultural sense, after “liberating” myself from some of these concepts I may be coming back to them, hopefully and in the benefit of my son in a more relaxed and “stoic” way.\n\nDefinitely I give little on money, fame; but I am too passionate with respect to the work we do; however I have not been able yet to control my anger and frustration with respect to “things that are not working”, most of the time with myself, but many times with others as well, unfortunately experience has made me  less and less tolerant to the endless repetition of mistakes, wasted efforts, mindlessness. \n\nOn the up-side, as an engineer I was trained to look for a rational approach to understanding the world and most importantly, a practical one in terms of always looking for solutions; also as a professional working in the environmental field, I am very close to the pantheistic views of stoic philosophy.\n\nMy expectation with respect to the course is to learn how to live a good life, find a rational explanation for human behavior, most importantly my own behavior, practical aspects of my life and work, which I was evidently not given the talent to understand intuitively.  By understanding and gaining consciousness of my “passions”, I also hope to gain control over them. Not be angered, not be insulted, not every feeling the victim, and being more emphatic with respect to others.\n\nPersonally and very un-stoic-like, I would also be proud to re-insert into more academic topics and I am always tempted to teach; since last year our team is having a monthly work-shop on leadership, work ethics, motivation, administration of time; the idea to introduce stoic principles into our work is very tempting, but I have to first acquire the knowledge, discipline and, of course, the right to serve as an example in order to do so.\n\nI would very much like to be an example for my boy as well, who is 13 years old by now and can probably still be spared some suffering; he should not learn "that everything is rosy", "everybody is nice", and later find out the hard way; nor should he be afraid. \n\nIn summary, I am 48 years old, I have a son; I have planted a tree, made and lost a lot of money (at least for my conservative, middle class standards), recycled several of my former girl-friends (unsuccessfully) and maybe I can still write a book, make some more money or another child, but even though this sounds a lot like mid-life-crisis in my opinion I am actually getting out of it; in fact it rather seems there is no more time to waste in becoming a philosopher.\n', 1, '', 0, 0, 0, '', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', 0, 1, '2019-03-29', '');

But although my father was a high school dropout, he later attended a technical school and completed his high school diploma and other studies with straight “A”s.  He went on to be a bus driver for the Los  Angeles RTD (now MTA).  He was a union member and dedicated to excellence in his work.  My mother ventured to Los Angeles from Illinois with some acquaintances to look for a job in California and some excitement that the Hollywood area offered with the movie industry.  She got a job as a secretary in a printing company and quickly proved her worth, eventually managing the billing office.  My mom was also dedicated to excellence in her work, and advanced her knowledge in changing technology by attending classes and paving new ground at her company with the technology and skills she learned.  I had only one sister, five years younger.  Both my parents were not very intellectually oriented, nor were they college graduates, yet they were intelligent and had a good ethic in work and in family loving my sister and I, giving us a disciplined upbringing, and providing for our needs and for opportunities to enjoy life and actualize ourselves.  My father was nominally catholic from his French Canadian family and my mom was nominally Christian even though her mother and father did not raise her and her sister very religiously (her father being mostly nonreligious and her mother quietly and personally a pious Christian).  But my mother did receive exposure off and on to more serious religious faith practiced openly by her relatives who were members of conservative Christian denominations of German origin.  My mother was very hard working at home and active in getting us involved in activities, especially in nature gardening, camping, and even backpacking.  My father, after being pretty much an atheist a year or two after I was born, became interested in the supernatural, and eventually landed upon evangelical charismatic Christianity.   So I was raised in quite a religious family from about eight years old on.  My father worked a lot and was very involved in Church and Christian groups, as well as the union, so I saw much less of him than my mom, but he always tried to involve me in some of what he did.  He was less interested in the activities such as gardening, traveling, camping and backpacking, but he loved to beat me in chess after I initially taught him and then he surpassed me! \n\nI very much respected my father\'s religious beliefs and ideas growing up.  I attended Christian schools from the fourth grade until twelfth grade.  I was more inclined to take the Christian beliefs and practice seriously  than the average child.  When I started college at a community college I quickly decided that I wanted to transfer to a Bible College and study for the ministry.  That was the worst mistake, if staying a Christian was the goal.  My always critical and inquisitive mind, with a keen sense for truth could not sustain an authentic belief in the Christian Bible and teachings.  I dropped out and returned to secular college.  Initially, I thought of myself an atheist, but fairly quickly transformed into a vague belief in some soft of God that I could not fully understand.  Throughout college and after I continued to search for some world view, and faith or spirituality that I could hold an honest heart-felt belief in and that would nourish me spiritually.  I stumbled upon various religious ideas and certain religious movements and organizations with which I sought insights and guidance for life.  Those that spoke to me most were Unitarian Universalism, Process Philosophy and Theology, Buddhism, and even Panentheism and Pantheism.  I was also sympathetic to atheists and agnostics, but did not identify myself with them much for many years. In fact, I participated frequently in Unitarian Universalists congregations for many years and always wished they had more “God” in their life.  If I were to identify myself, even now, with any religious community and principled beliefs and values it would be Unitarian Universalism.  However, later I took a religious personality test and it identified me as Buddhist.  Although I had read some about Buddhism, I didn\'t consider myself one, so at that time I decided to take a deep look at Buddhism and began practicing it and calling myself a very bad Buddhist for a while.  I still think of myself as someone who learns much from Buddhism and puts some of it into practice in life.\n\nIn 1988, I graduated from UCLA with a B.A. geography and eventually found my career in being a software engineer specializing in geographic information system programming.  In social life I was not always the thriving. I had a hard time getting dates with women.  I had one girlfriend in college and some off-and-on dating relationships over the years until I finally met my wife after learning to dance some. (I met her dancing – she really likes to dance.)  After dating for three years I married her and with her two children we became an instant family of four.  Marriage and family life was always a mixture of deep satisfaction, hard work, and difficulty and frustration.  The children had to frequently visit their biological father and there was conflict between him and my wife.  The children\'s father had mental illness that impacted all of us.  In spite of the challenges, the relationship to my wife, the marriage and the family life was all quite worthwhile, but I was not fully prepared for the isolation I sometimes felt in all of that.  I had some individual pursuits that I sometimes retreated into for refuge, although I never detached myself from my relation ship with my wife and family.  I read books, some on religion, others on science.  I read a book on physics that challenged my sense that I had free will due to the convincing arguments for complete physical determinism.  That troubled me so I went on a long philosophical journey to try and resolve that.  I took two philosophy courses at community college, and read books on philosophy.  Process Philosophy was my early favorite, though that changed as I progressed.  My good marriage and relationship to my wife eventually took a bad turn  when my wife developed resentful feelings because I could not match her physical and intimacy needs, as she understood them.  We had good sex life, but not consistently good, and I later realized how she needed more of my time and attention to be satisfied.  I as spread too thin, especially when I decided to start pursuing a college post graduate certificate and possible Masters degree.  Eventually we divorced.  The four years leading up to the divorce were the darkest years of my life.  I was in and out of deep depression and often receiving counseling, though never requiring medication.  My father also passed away during that time.  I could not pull myself out consistently, only temporarily, and always hovered just above depression at best.\n\nThe first time I remember being made aware of Stoicism was when we went to the funeral home to prepare for my father\'s cremation in July of 2012.  A pamphlet on grieving suggested reading the ancient Stoics.  At that time I downloaded some free e-books of the Stoics and read some.  But it didn\'t quite catch me yet.  I was turned off at first and couldn\'t take reading it much.  But the desire to look into Stoicism stayed with me and periodically I would revisit it, reading little bits here and there.  Also, in dealing with depression, I had been exposed to Cognitive Behavioral Therapy and at some point became aware that this was in part influenced by Stoic therapeutic practices. I don\'t remember which came first but two events increased my interest in Stoicism.  On the he anniversary of my father\'s death in July 2013, I acquired an e-book Guide to Stoicism by St. George William Joseph Stock and read that some time after that.  Around the same time I ran across newstoa.com and explored that and read The Stoic Handbook, by Erik Wiegardt.  By that time my interest in Stoicism intensified so in Febrary 2014, I read the William Irvine\'s book A Guide to the Good Life as an e-book, which confirmed for me the relevance and benefits of Stoicism to me.  Somewhere around this time I registered as a Stoic on newstoa.com.   I have read a letter or two from an e-book form of Dialogues and Essays (Oxford World Classics), John Davie translator.  Later I read the entire Mediations by Marcus Aurelius in the Penguin Classics edition, translated by Maxwell Staniforth, also as an e-book.  Recently I have been reading an e-book Stoicism Today: Selected Writings (Volume One) edited by Patrick Ussher.  From May 2014 to August 2015 I was the only active event organizer for the San Diego Stoics meetup group on meetup.com.  I organized ten meetings (Erik Wiegardt attended one of them).  I stepped down as event organizer in September 2015, due to a sense of ineffectiveness and being ill prepared, low and inconsistent turnout, as well as a need for more time to work on pulling myself together after my divorce a few months earlier.  I also had an identity crisis, having a problem identifying myself as anything in particular and didn\'t think I was a worthy representative of anything that influenced me or guided me or that was a movement that I was supporting.\n\nAll along during the time between 2011 and now, I was active in local philosophical discussion groups and read books on philosophy, including those in the philosophy of mind, logic, epistemology, metaphysics, and ancient philosophy including Plato and Aristotle.  Having been identified as a “Kantian Structuralist” in a philosophic personality test, without knowing much about Kant at all, I naturally read up a bit on that.  In spite of being identified as a Kantian, I found that certain aspects of his philosophy I find agreeable; others not so much.  I also had become an atheist by about 2011 and became involved with atheist and humanist groups.  Observations in our American political life have rekindled an old interest in socialism and so I been interested in studying socialist thought and getting that into our political debates in this country.  I would like to see us thoughtfully pursue a more economically just society that is not ruled by the oversimplified crassness and rules of property and profit.  What I learn from Stoicism informs the kind of socialist ideas I think are best. I keep a good distinction between what the individual should do in life given what is actually and already there vs. what improvements or transformations we can work to politically create as we are able.  For a time I was organizing meetings in the San Diego Socialist Study group to further that cause, but that has been on hiatus for a few months.\n\nIn the last few weeks, I have wanted to put forth an effort to learn a Stoic inspired philosophy, deep world view, and spiritual life practice that is one I an honestly accept as authentic and beneficial.  Although I have been cautious in saying that I am such-and-such-ist/ian anything, I do consider myself primarily a Stoic (not a sage!), because I see that as the primary structure of my world view and life practice and general attitude toward life.  But I am also someone who learns insights and practice from Buddhism, and counterbalancing insights from Taoism.  I am a Humanist because as humans we need to focus on what it is up to humans to do and live the human life on this earth (or wherever we manage to travel to).  I practice atheism, not to assert the non-existence of an entity I can\'t quite wrap my head around, but to avoid idolatry and attachment to the concept and the distraction that entails.  On the other hand, I am agnostic in that I have no knowledge of the existence of God.  But when I want to connect with the ideas of the divine, totality and transcendence, I am pretty much a pantheist (which is not far off from a lofty naturalist atheism).\n\nI was recently inspired by listening to several podcasts of “The Painted Porch”.  I realized my entire Stoic library was in e-books.  I wanted to round out the Stoic library and include some real bound books, and some additional e-books to have handy when all I carry is the Kindle.  I researched what books to get and so I acquired the following:\n* Letters from a Stoic, by Seneca, Robin Campbell, translator (real hardback book)\n* Musonius Rufus: Lectures and Sayings, Cynthia King, translator (e-book)\n* Epictetus Discourses Books 1-2 (Loeb Classical Library), W. A. Oldfather, translator (real hardback book)\n* Epictetus Discourses Books 3-4, Fragments, The Encheiridion (Loeb Classical Library), W. A. Oldfather, translator (real hardback book)\n* Discourses, Fragments, Handbook (Oxford World Classics) by Epictetus, Robin Hard, translator (e-book)\n* Meditations, by Marcus Aurelius Gregory Hays, translator (real hardback book)\n* Stoicism, by John Sellars (real hardback book)\n* The Art of Living, by John Sellars (real paperback book)\n\nI listened a podcast of “The Painted Porch” and heard Erik Wiegardt interviewed. He spoke of the College of Stoic Philosophers, which I had kept a background interest in for the last couple of years.  I took a look at in on the web site and noticed that John Sellars book Stoicism was the primary text.  Since I already ordered that book and was planning on reading it, I thought it would be good to read it as part of the course, rather than just read it independently.  I expect that I will get more out of it that way (but what actually happens is not entirely up to me).  I also have plenty of books by Seneca, Epictetus and Marcus Aurelius for other reading for the course.  Whereas before, I was primarily interested in the Stoic ethics and psychological therapy practices. I know have the beginnings of an appreciation for benefits of working with the complete three branches of Stoicism, physics, logic, and ethics.  I would like to come to an authentic understanding of all of these, updated as needed for me to be honest and authentic in my acceptance of them.  My bent is to be as naturalist as possible.  I have deep issues with the idea of a unitary telos and a Providence, and I\'m skeptical of the assertion that the Universe is conscious, but I have been working on developing a parallel naturalist understanding that plays a similar role in underpinning my personal philosophy.  I want to take full advantage of modern logical methods, or just plain good critical thinking, not confining myself to ancient Stoic logic.  But I am interested in the attitudes that the Stoics took to the application of logic and the reasons for applying logic as well as the issues they raised and what problems they wanted to solve and how it comes into play in practicing Soticism.  I think attention to such things with a Stoic angle would be beneficial.  I am also interested in Stoicism as a structure and point of departure to apply as I also learn from other philosophical thought, Humanism, Buddhism, and Taoism.  I would like to begin soon my studies in the School of Essential Studies: Theory & Practice Course of the College of Stoic Philosophers.\n\nSincerely,\nMichael Dorais', 1, '', 0, 0, 0, '', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', 1, 0, '', ''),

I would need only time to order the reading materials.', 'To begin with let me cover the ‘characters’ that the ‘Author’ has assigned to me. I am a husband and father of three children. I work as a school counselor at the junior high level. At my school I also coach cross country and track. My hobbies can be grouped into three topics; running (running, orienteering, adventure racing), music (playing banjo and mandolin) and spirituality (Christian and Stoic studies). My goal, of course, is excellence in all of these areas.\nMy interest in Stoicism actually started with The Hobbit. I read a comparison of the Ring of Gyges from Plato’s Republic and the One Ring of Power. This led to my study of the Republic. I found Plato’s teachings on Virtue to be Truth and inspiration. My study of Virtue put me on the path to Stoicism, with my first book being Irvine’s “A Guide to the Good Life: The Ancient Art of Stoic Joy”. I also started on the Meditations of Marcus Aurelius. This was about 3 years ago.\nStoicism really took off for me when I was at a particularly low point. Since my high school days I had been a competitive runner. In the Fall of 2013 I had arthroscopic surgery on my left knee, which actually made matters considerably worse (from limited running to no running). Major reconstructive surgery was done in February of 2014 and I found myself unable to walk for over a month. During this time of recovery, I refocused on Stoicism and was struck by the words of Epictetus “Sickness is a hindrance to the body, but not to your ability to choose, unless that is your choice. Lameness is a hindrance to the leg, but not to your ability to choose” (Enchiridion 9).\nI found freedom in the teachings of the Enchiridion and decided to further explore the writings of Epictetus. Though they are not as popular in the Stoic community, the ‘Golden Sayings’ collection particularly resonated with me. As a Christian, the Golden Sayings put Stoicism into a framework that I could better understand and relate to. From there I eventually found Donald Robertson’s site and the Stoicism group on Facebook. Interactions with other aspiring philosophers was helpful in understanding how others applied the teachings in their own lives. Seeing as the ‘Golden Sayings’ wasn’t respected among the atheistic members, I studied and acquainted myself with ‘The Discourses of Epictetus’.\nIt is no secret that I am a Theist. I believe in a God that is the creator and sustainer of our universe. I agree with Epictetus that the ‘real nature of God’ is ‘Intelligence, Knowledge, Right Reason’ (Golden Sayings 58), that God lives within us and that we can have ‘communion’ with Him (Golden Sayings 16). My Theistic beliefs started as a child and were reinforced by my religious upbringing. For a period in my late teens and early twenties I abandoned those beliefs, before strongly renewing my practice in my mid-twenties.\nI was baptized Roman Catholic at birth and attended Parochial school for my elementary years. As a student I assimilated the practices and beliefs of my faith. This continued into High School as I enrolled at Monroe Catholic Central, attending church regularly. As previously mentioned, this dropped off during and after college. In my mid twenties as I prepared to get married I had to answer the question of what I believed. I made full recommitment to the Catholic faith.\nAt St. Ignatius Church here in Oregon I became a highly involved parishioner. I was a member of their RCIA team (Right of Christian Initiation for Adults) and helped teach the faith to new adult members. I was also a Reader, of scripture and prayers during service. As our family grew, the Catholic church was no longer a good fit. We explored other churches and ended up at Prince of Peace Lutheran church. As before I volunteered my services. I am currently a reader and a member of the contemporary worship Praise Band, playing guitar and mandolin.\nInitially I considered myself to be a Christian interested in Stoicism. As my practice continued I changed my stance to Stoic Christian. I even created a Facebook group, which I later decided not to proceed with and tried to delete, but haven’t been able to. At any rate, I have increasingly been thinking in terms of Stoicism. I am still a practicing Christian and hold to the beliefs of my faith, but much of my focus is on Stoic philosophy. I am to the point where I would consider myself a Stoic.\nI would describe my daily Stoic practice as listening, contemplating, reading and discussing. As I mentioned before, a reconstructive knee surgery ended my ability to run, for a time. After several months of recovery and physical therapy I was able to ride a bike and do the elliptical machine. I listen to music and audiobooks to pass the time. During these workouts I typically listen to ‘Pray as You Go’ (a British Jesuit daily prayer meditation) for the first 15 minutes, then either the ‘Enchiridion’ or ‘Golden Sayings’ for the remainder. Some days I just listen to music or watch a video, but I can say that in the last couple of years I have listened to the ‘Enchiridion’ and the ‘Golden Sayings’ several times each and have them ‘at hand’ whenever I need them.\nAlso instrumental in my practice is my involvement in the Facebook Stoicism group, where discussion has done much to expose me to a variety of perspectives on the philosophy. This has led to reading, exploring and interpreting excerpts from original sources, which I have found to be quite valuable. Finally, I mention contemplation because that is the ideal state I try to maintain. I do not watch television, unless it is a movie with the kids and do not engage in social media beyond the Facebook group. I try to be mindful of the Stoic goals and readings I have done and to apply them to daily life.\nBefore beginning my study in Stoicism I studied psychology and religion. I have my Master’s Degree in counseling and continue to take classes at the graduate level to improve my abilities as a counselor. In terms of religion, my most recent interest has been in the Spiritual Exercises of Ignatius of Loyola. I was particularly drawn to his “Principle and Foundation”. Looking at this now I can see that it reflects Stoic themes, “For it is necessary to make ourselves indifferent to all created things in all that is allowed to the choice of our free will and is not prohibited to it; so that, on our part, we want not health rather than sickness, riches rather than poverty…desiring and choosing only what is most conductive for us to the end for which we are created” (Spiritual Exercise, Ignatius of Loyola).\nOne of the true benefits of Stoicism is in its applicability. I have used Stoic principles to improve my life. I have also shared Stoic Wisdom with my family, friends and the students that I work with. The purpose of my enrolling in the College of Stoic Philosophers is to continue to grow in my knowledge of the philosophy. Ideally I would like to get from this course a better foundation for my practice. I am drawn to Epictetus and focus on him, but would like to get a more well-rounded understanding.\nI would appreciate the opportunity to study at The College of Stoic Philosophers.\n', 1, '', 0, 0, 0, '', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', 1, 0, '', ''),

Myself and my twin sister were born in Chicago, Illinois on 25 December 1968.  I have an older sister that was also born in 1968 but in January.  Peoples first reaction on hearing my birthday is “Wow,” quickly followed by “that must suck.”  To which my response is, “it\'s not that bad”.  Sure, when I was young people forgot my birthday and gave me a “combined” present, but when I got older I realize most people don\'t have to work on my birthday and family and friends are usually getting together and having a good time.\n\nBoth my parents worked so my grandmother took care of us during the day.  My father and his family are from Cuba and my grandmother used to teach there.  That meant my sister\'s and I were her Kindergarten while growing up.  The result was that we grew up bilingual.  This was the beginning of my grandparents being more like a mother and father to me.\n\nMy parents believed that our education in the public system was lacking so they sent us to Catholic school despite my father being a firm atheist. This continued through high school. In my youth I had a need to know why things were done a certain way and at first simple answers were enough.  Eventually I started breaking things down in a effort to gain understanding.  I remembering mentioning to my mother that the food we were eating was just the muscle of a dead cow.  I found it strange how disturbed she was by that statement.  That was when the statement “ignorance is bliss” made sense to me but I realized I could not live like that.  By the time I was in high school the answers I was receiving on religion did not suffice.  It was then that I began my lifelong search for answers on life that I though religion could answer, and eventually led me to Stoicism.\n\nAfter high school I joined the army for a two year tour.  I did so in order to pay my way through college and to see if I enjoyed the military as a career.  My parents had saved up money for my education, but I wanted to pay for my own continuing education.  The army was an interesting time where I learned skills that would be difficult to learn elsewhere, but I didn\'t feel sufficiently mentally challenged.  This led, quit naturally, to the university.\n\nCollege was an excellent experience, but it took meeting the woman I was going to marry to get me to focus on a career.  After this, I focused on accounting in order to finish my schooling quickly.  I have a talent for mathematics and remembering and applying rules so accounting seemed like an easy fit and a way to quickly get a degree.\n\nAfter marriage my wife and I both worked.  Eventually, I changed jobs and found myself in a dream job.  I was working for a consulting company as a programmer in their financial division.  The job was intellectually challenging with hard deadlines and near instant gratification upon compiling the code.  The people I worked with were, by and large, of the same mind set and we had similar interests.  Once I was settled in this job, I encouraged my wife to go for her dream of becoming a doctor.  She did.\n\nShe was accepted into medical school in Iowa.  This meant leaving my job and moving to a small town.  After living most of my life in a big city it was a difficult change.  I now look on this time as a four year banishment that, by the last year, I really started to enjoy.  We moved back to the suburbs of Chicago for her residency and had a daughter during her second year.  It was at this time I started working from home part-time in order to take care of my daughter.  My wife was accepted into a fellowship in Wisconsin after residency.  This meant another move and that I would have to work from home full-time in order to watch our daughter.  This was during the financial melt down so I decided to become a full-time stay at home dad.  After fellowship my wife found a job back in the suburbs of Chicago and that is where we have been since.\n  \nI have been interested in philosophy in general and stoicism in particular, off and on, for the past 10 years.  The idea of practical and applicable philosophy fascinates me, but I seemed to always select academic books on the subject to try and learn about philosophy.  These books were more concerned with the theoretical aspects and were difficult to get through. My interest in philosophy went hand in hand with my search for meaning that I had been on since high school.  At the beginning of this year I came across Dr. Irvine\'s book “A Guide to the Good Life.”  This was the first time that I had found that a philosophy book laid out its ideas plainly and simply.  Many of the ideas were ones that I already followed and those that I hadn\'t thought about made sense.  I quickly went on to read Robertson\'s “Stoicism and the Art of Happiness,” and Seneca\'s “On Anger,” “On Tranquility of Mind,” “On a Happy Life,” “On the Shortness of Life,” and “Consolation to Marcia.”  I started listening to Painted Porch and Good Fortune podcast.  It was through these that I heard about the classes offered through New Stoa.  This course looks to be an excellent way to ground me in stoicism and guide me around any potential pitfalls.  I am also taking this course with an eye on the next step of joining the Marcus Aurelius School.\n\nI do not consider myself a stoic, but I do consider myself a student of stoicism.  Perhaps after this or the following school I will consider myself a stoic.  I am not a member of any religious group though I have studied many different religions throughout my life, and I would consider myself to be a theist.\n\nI would like to thank you for this opportunity and your consideration to this school.

I was born in London and emigrated to Australia from with my parents in 1970, aged 10. My education was effectively derailed from that point on. After what I reflect upon as a troubled childhood, I left school and joined the workforce a month or so before my fifteenth birthday. I had several jobs early on but soon settled into factory work, eventually operating high-speed machinery for the next twenty-five years. I married at twenty four years of age and we had the first of four children when I was thirty six.\nDuring all this time I read copiously, if randomly, from various classics (English translations) and what was called “great Literature.” Reflecting again, I believe I was compensating for my lack of education and the associated insecurities I’d developed. I researched and wrote a novel during this time (unpublished), set among the Anglican clergy and inspired by my uncle—a bishop of Nottingham who suffered a spectacular fall from grace. We lived in Nottingham for eighteen months before coming to Australia, and I have fond memories of exploring the cathedral, the ruined abbey and the bishop’s palace.\nJust after my fortieth birthday, and the birth of our fourth child, my wife became ill with cancer and died some eighteen months later, leaving me with the children, ranging in age between 18 months and seven years old. I was obliged to give up work and decided to undertake an Arts degree in tandem with my duties as a full-time father. I majored in English Literature, History, and the History of Theatre and Drama—with considerable focus on Ancient Greek theatre and poetics.\nSome three years after the death of my first wife I remarried (at the time a somewhat pragmatic, but happy decision as it turns out). My new wife had no children of her own and so I agreed to having one more—subsequently being blessed with twins. My two oldest are now at university themselves and all the children are well balanced and intelligent individuals, for which I share the credit with my excellent new wife.\nI completed my Arts degree with first class honours, winning the university medal and other prizes, including an Honours Dissertation Prize for a critique of Stephen Greenblatt’s “New Historicism”. I subsequently won an APA scholarship and received a PhD in 2014. My doctoral dissertation critiqued Raymond Williams’ “Cultural Materialism” (a post-Marxist orientation complementing Greenblatt’s work and deriving also from the Continental philosophical tradition. The paper ended up being a critique of Marxist materialism in general, with particular focuses on Kant/Hegel/Schelling, Marx/Engels, the Frankfurt School, some modern theorists like Slavoj Zizek and Ernesto Laclau, and one chapter on the problem of consciousness from an Analytic perspective.\nMy dissertation was too broad and so necessarily lacked sufficient depth, and though I received my PhD, it remains unpublished. I think the paper has merit and I still want to pursue some of the material more deeply—indeed incorporating stoicism—with an eye to publication. I have nothing published as yet, however, and though I lectured, tutored and marked papers for a few years there, I haven’t managed to secure ongoing work in the tertiary sector. I live in a semi-regional area with only one university, so opportunities are limited; having a large family too, moving would be very disruptive and problematic.\nIn hindsight, I’m very satisfied with my belated academic career, and having achieved all I have without so much as a high school certificate, single-handedly (for a while) bringing up a large family and working part-time all the while. For the last few years, while writing my dissertation and since, I’ve run and operated a small carpet cleaning business to make ends meet, and can perhaps lay claim to being the best educated cleaner in Toowoomba (a town of some 100,000 people)!\nI owe what I have achieved to reading, and among the most influential material I digested before university were texts on Theravada Buddhism, Montaigne’s and Emerson’s essays, the works of Tolstoy and Dostoyevsky, and the quasi-Buddhist writings of Hermann Hesse. I also read a smattering of Plato, including The Apology, and anything I could find on Diogenes, whose philosophy always appealed to me. At university I did research on Roman history, including a special study on Nero, touching therefore also on Seneca (whom I was also vaguely familiar with via Montaigne).\nI have only become intensely interested in Stoicism in the last twelve months or so, since completing my university studies and stumbling upon “Stoic Week”, though I believe I am a stoic by disposition. I have always believed in self-discipline—though certainly I haven’t always practiced it. For most of my life I’ve been a regular drinker, and eaten more rich food than was good for me—though I have managed to stay in reasonable physical shape. I gave up drinking and the decadent lifestyle two years ago and have finally embraced the self-discipline I always believed in theoretically. I am now fitter of body and mind than I’ve ever been, and am persevering in stoic practice day by day.\nI am by disposition an atheist, but life experience and learning have made me agnostic—I am sceptical first of human hubris, and then of the adequacy of what’s detected by our limited human senses. I am persuaded that our shared existence is as subject to contingency and fortune as any atheist might insist, but that this is incumbent upon our human and temporal perspectives—which are not necessarily universals! Personal experience forced me to take an ambiguous stance and to question pure materialism; this has been my abiding study for several years now. I am however a materialist apropos the human condition, much as stoic naturalism is bifurcated in this way. I was intrigued years ago reading the Apology, when Socrates claimed to “know” of matters beyond the merely corporeal—not least since he was deemed wise for knowing he knew nothing!—and I’m deeply interested in the Stoic accommodation of deism and predestination.\nI very much enjoy reading and re-reading Marcus Aurelius’ Meditations as well as Epictetus’ and Seneca’s texts. I’ve read much material online, including some excellent blogs, and I’ve also read Stoicism Today: Collected Writings. I’m currently reading the Cambridge Companion, and have ordered several other books which are yet to arrive.\nI am still very much a novice, however, and I wish to advance my understanding and practice of Stoicism, both as a way of life and as an interventionary philosophy aimed at consumerism and materialistic culture. If I have any expertise it is on the subject of collective culture, which in the modern West runs antithetically to the virtues and a eudemonic life. Stoicism thus serves, by extension, as an enduring critique of consumerism and a heuristic for how we should live.\n', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, '', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', 1, 0, '', ''),

I believe that this verse is a reference to the Mysteries; man is the microcosm in the macrocosm. The individual soul carries a spark of the divine fire. By knowing, and mastering your thoughts, emotions, and actions, and bringing them into accord with each other so that there are no inner contradictions in your makeup, you may emulate the Divine while here on Earth. \n\nMy name is Leah Goldrick. I am 34, married, and living in the United States with my husband and infant son. I am a part-time children’s librarian. The rest of my time is devoted to raising my son, taking care of my husband, household duties, freelance writing, and educating myself. I author the blog Common Sense Ethics, which is dedicated to helping people by raising awareness of the importance of ethics and character, and subtly arguing for practical Stoic and Natural Law based morality. \n\nI was born in New Jersey in 1981, and have spent to majority of my life living here. The most valuable thing I received from my family was a love of reading and intellectual curiosity. My mother is one of seven children, and I grew up with strong family ties, living within a few miles of both my grandparents, and many extended family members. \n\nMy parents are former hippies. They are secular and agnostic, and I was raised without adherence to any religion. This is a blessing in that I was encouraged to think for myself and to make my own decisions, but I simultaneously feel that I lacked concrete moral education in my upbringing. I have had to learn on my own, often by suffering through some mistakes. My father isn’t the best at controlling his anger and emotions, and his emotionalism was imparted to me. This is one of my personal challenges, and I am still learning to govern myself and remain calm and patient when under stress. \n\nAs a teenager I was very much, and still am, a contrarian in many ways. I disliked aspects of popular culture. I was a reader and an autodidact, and I was drawn to atheist philosophers such as Nietzsche and Sartre. I was very sure of myself in a juvenile sort of way. I valued sophrosyne, and did not indulge in alcohol or substances. \n \nI enjoyed history in high school, and chose to study it when I enrolled at Rutgers University in 1999. If I had the decision to make again, I might have majored in classics instead of history, because then I would have learned Latin when I had both the time and incentive to study it intensely. I regret not knowing Latin or Greek now. But one thing effects another in life, so I don’t regret my decision, just the deficiencies in my education. \n\nI took an introduction to philosophy class my first semester of college, and afterwards decided to double major in history and philosophy. I found analytic philosophy lacking in some respects. I was able to occasionally study some of the Continental philosophers that interested me, but I managed to earn an entire BA without reading almost any ancient philosophy, and hardly any ethics that I can remember. By far one of the most interesting classes I took was Early Medieval Philosophy, where we studied the Neoplatonists, Boethius, and mystics like Al Ghazali. \n\nAround the end of my sophomore year, I had a few experiences which might be described as expansive and mystical, and I abandon atheism. I was exposed to people who were well read and interested in spirituality and comparative religion, and I adopted a quest approach as I began to educate myself on these subjects. I became interested in Carl Jung and Jungian psychology.  \n\nThere is a vast difference between understanding spiritual ideas, and being able to embody them morally speaking. Though I had always had a strong sense of myself and of sophrosyne as a teenager, I lacked real world experience. As a young adult, I gained what I lacked in real world experience, but lost what I had of sophrosyne. I had no understanding of the Natural Law, and I found that my emotional responses to situations were often out of sync with my rational faculty, and this sometimes caused me to regret my actions. I was somewhat wild and pleasure seeking, as people of that age tend to be. That whole period of time was fun and vastly educational, but emotionally and morally taxing. \n\nIn 2003, as part of my history degree, I did a practicum where I interned at the archives at Rutgers, and was subsequently offered a position as a student worker there. This was to direct my fate for some years to come. Upon graduating, I intended to pursue a PhD in either Jungian counseling psychology, or comparative religion. My parents dissuaded me from applying to PhD programs, questioning whether I had the fortitude to both complete a PhD program, or compete for the handful of available jobs as an academic. My mother is a librarian, and she instead suggested that I get my Masters in library and information science and work as an archivist using my history background, a path that I was already on given my employment situation and connections. \n\nI enrolled in the library and information science program at Rutgers. I lived at home and commuted while helping to take care of my aging grandmother who also lived with my parents. I was able to travel in Europe for several months while on break from school. \n\nIn 2005, while living at home, I met my now husband, and fate seems to have conspired to bring us together through a series of synchronicities. I consider myself very grateful to have him with me on my life journey, and our relationship has allowed me to grow enormously. \n\nWe both became interested in what can be called the deep state, Real Politik, or kleptocracy, around the 5th anniversary of 9/11. Many hypotheses outside of the mainstream narrative are actually quite reasonable, and many things about the world in every respect are not what they seem. This may be disconcerting to realize, but truth is great and mighty above all things. \n\nWhen I graduated from my Master’s program in early 2007, I was fortunate enough to land a permanent position as an archivist in Philadelphia, as these positions are very competitive. My husband and I moved in together. We I traveled to Greece in both 2007 and 2008. We visited Athens and saw the Stoa and Acropolis, as well as the beauty of Milos and Santorini. \n\nDuring this period of time I continued my spiritual inquiry and study of various religions. I was drawn to Buddhism and considered myself a Buddhist, but in retrospect I always felt like I was searching for something or that something was missing. Buddhism is a monastic tradition, and has less to offer busy Westerners than our own arcane Western wisdom traditions, which I had yet to discover. I considered doing something radical, like moving abroad or living an nontraditional life in some way. \n\nDue to ongoing poor management at my place of employment, I became less satisfied with my working life than I had hoped to be. I was beginning to burn out in public service, and I came to resent my job. Though happy, my relationship experienced occasional communication problems. I hit a spiritual crisis point in 2010-2011, as I was fed up with my job and facing a difficult time in my relationship with my husband. I was experiencing extreme anxiety, which was affecting my performance at work. \n\nI had some inclination that my shadow self, in the Jungian sense, and my emotionalism, were to blame for my anxiety and dissatisfaction. Jung’s comment,” Until you make the unconscious conscious, it will direct your life and you will call it fate,” seems particularly applicable. \n\nI began to explore the shadow elements of my personality and to consider how they were affecting my behavior and my sense of dissatisfaction. Things began to improve all around. My husband proposed to me, and I was able to mostly resolve my anxiety through nutrition and employing new ways of thinking, such as focusing on the present.  \n\nMy interests in the political, spiritual, moral, psychological and arcane converged upon discovering the research of Mark Passio and Manly P. Hall around the end of 2011. Both are scholars of what one may call the Western Mystery traditions (Alchemy, Hermeticism, Pythagorianism, Freemasonry, etc.) and the Natural Law, with the former exploring deep state politics and psychology as well. Everything clicked for me when I began to delve into the Western wisdom traditions, which provide an arcane prescription for self-governance, ethics, and metaphysics. I really began to take ethics seriously in terms of my personal behavior, to improve myself continually, and to not let my emotions overwhelm me. \n\n2012 was a very happy year. My husband and I were married in a small ceremony on Martha’s Vineyard, Massachusetts. We honeymooned in Rome and Sardinia. Things improved at work. \nIn early 2013, I was laid off from my job due to budget cuts. My layoff was a great thing. I was able to collect severance, and I found a temporary job that I liked, where I worked periodically until my son’s birth in 2015. \n\nI had the time to begin my own blog, and my interest in Stoicism began in 2013, as an outgrowth of that project. Stoicism is of course, a philosophy which is grounded in the Law of Nature, and upon further inquiry it became obvious that some, if not many of the Stoic philosophers, were initiates of the Mysteries, which only deepened my interest. The Stoic tradition offers practical advice for living which I find very helpful. \n\nI finished reading the Meditations last year, and I am currently reading the Enchiridion. I have also read various translations of Musonius Rufus’ fragments, and because of his emphasis on the philosophical education of women and children, marriage, and strong spirituality, he is perhaps my favorite Stoic author. I participated in Stoic Week 2015, which I found useful. I have recently joined the Society of Epictetus. The ancients did not tend to separate out their ethics and their metaphysics the way moderns do. \n\nI consider myself a practicing Stoic or Stoic in training. I was blessed to have become a parent last year, and Stoic philosophy is invaluable for parenting. I have written on the topic of Stoic parenting, and the piece is due to be published on Stoicism Today in April, if you interested in knowing specifically which verses and ideas I have found helpful. With the demands of having a baby at home, I often forget to do the morning and evening meditations. I would like to improve in this respect. \n\nI would happily identify as theist, pantheist, or even esoteric initiate. I have always been suspicious of organized religion, and I don\'t endorse joining any groups which are hierarchical or secretive in nature. However, I realize that each religion has something to offer in terms of its teachings, and at a higher level all religions and schools share a transcendent unity. But a jack of all trades, master of none, the saying goes. I am interested in exploring Stoicism exhaustively, and applying it for my own personal growth, and for the benefit of my family and others generally.', 1, '', 0, 0, 0, '', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', 0, 0, '', '');

I am interested in pursuing education in Stoicism because it has been an interest of mine for the last several years, since 2012.  I have read and picked through a few books on Stoicism since then, but something I believe I lack to understand the philosophy more and be a better practitioner is guidance and community.  I hope that this course and future courses may help me become a better practitioner of Stoicism.\n   I grew up in a small town in Missouri, to a supportive, but separated family.  My mom and dad were divorced before I can remember, and my mom had remarried before I can remember.  My step-dad has been a major father figure to me growing up.  That’s not to say that my biological father was not supportive, he was extremely supportive, but lived in another state so lessons learned from him were minimal compared to those learned from my step-father.  In fact, I’ve always considered myself pretty lucky; many children grow up without a father figure, but I had two!\n   Even growing up with two sets of family – my father eventually remarried, too- I had common struggles I assume many kids around the world face.  My mother and step-father seemed to never get along.  Yelling and screaming was a morning ritual and worked almost as an alarm clock in the morning.  Neither parent was any good at understanding, nor controlling his or her own emotions, and you could forget about them communicating their emotions in anything other than anger.  It seemed that they both had a sense of narcissism and when faced with a struggle, blame always turned to the other person and it became a war of who could remember what the other had done to them as far back as they could remember.  Myself, and my siblings were not just bystanders in these crazy arguments.  We were often used as bait or tools to slash at the others’ emotions and fuel the fire of emotional combat.  Getting by and telling myself there is nothing you can do about it became my defense mechanism.  From the outside I could tell that they were both in the wrong, but trying to tell them that would only insert myself into a three-way tie.  I learned to be a pleaser and tried to make sure I didn’t get in trouble and did well in school.  I did anything I could to try and get positive energy from my parents, particularly my mom.  If I did something wrong, the anger was 10 times worse than when I was praised by doing something good.  But for me, a smidgen of praise was always better than a force of anger and yelling.\n   After high school I went to college for a few years.  In college I really began to question who I was and what I believed in.  I questioned truth of God, or any higher power for that matter.  I had grown up Christian, but why?  What else was out there?  I looked into other religions, particularly Buddhism.  I began to really try and determine who I was and what I believed in.  I was surrounded by people who loved me and I could live without fear of being yelled at or getting in trouble.  I was free.  But, who was I?  Was I a man, yet, out on my own?  Where did I stand?  College and freedom wasn’t enough to give me those answers.  I needed something else to challenge me and help me determine who I was, what I stood for, and what I believed in.\n   After a year and a half of college, I dropped everything went to the United States Marine Corps recruiting station and signed up.  Two days later I called my mom, step-father, and siblings for a dinner at one of the only places to eat in my hometown.   I broke the news to them of what I had done.  On the third day I was on a plane for San Diego.  \n  The Marine Corps presented new challenges and I was finally going to be able to call myself a man and have a sense of confidence about who I was.  Only, that wasn’t the case.  I spent six years in the Marine Corps and learned many good things, but the bad ones are the ones that still haunt me.  The Marine Corps taught me to drink.  The Marine Corps taught me that lashing out in anger was justified.  The Marine Corps taught me to be entitled.  After everything I had done and been through in the Marine Corps, I was left bitter.  \n   After leaving the Marines, I had met a girl and decided to return to college.  We had ups and downs like most relationships, but mostly she was very supportive of me returning to college and very patient with my obscure emotional patterns that I had developed in the Marines.  I had a hard time figuring out how to be a good person to her, even though I knew the answer, I couldn’t seem to put it into action all the time.  The emotional challenges of being separated from my “pack” in the Marines, new stressors of school, and trying to face life and relationship challenges took their toll.  I began seeing myself as my parents and facing my girlfriend with my loud roar anytime we had a disagreement.  I felt myself becoming enraged at other people because they were “stupid.”  Someone was always doing something that made me displeased and it made me angry.  I hated almost everything and everyone around me. \n   I knew it wasn’t right, the way I was acting in times of adversity and the nagging of myself and others, so I began to search for ways to help develop myself to be a better, more understanding person.  Someone in control of their emotions, not the other way around, like my parents.  That’s when I discovered Stoicism.  \n   I began studying Stoicism while in my final year of college.  I would take breaks in the library while studying for an exam to crack open “A Guide to the Good Life: The Ancient Art of Stoic Joy.”  I became consumed with reading literature on Stoicism.  I read blogs and books.  I read “Meditations,” and picked through many others.  I was trying to figure out steps to take and ways to react to challenges more like a Stoic.  \n   The result of my Stoic studies is a greatly improved outlook on life and the situations that I face on a daily basis.  I have grown to be a better person and a more understanding citizen.  However, my challenges now are the ebb and flow of living Stoically.  I struggle with continually living Stoically.  Over time, I have begun to seek Stoicism when something bad happens or I am faced with self-pity or inner struggle.  Instead, I feel like a better approach to life is to learn how to be a Stoic everyday through both good and bad times.  I think if I can gain a mentor in Stoicism it will help me accomplish this by making it a larger and more necessary part of my life, like water.  Through taking the SES course I seek to water myself and become a complete Stoic.  I want Stoicism to be a daily practice and a part of who I am, rather than just a tool to combat struggle.  In order for me to do this, I need to begin to report to someone who has reached a level of Stoic life and virtue that I seek in myself.  I need guidance and I need community.  \n\nThank you for reading my brief story and thank you for considering me as a student in your school.  I look forward to hearing from you.\n\nRespectfully, \nJake Burnett\n', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, '', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', 1, 0, '', ''),

I was born and raised in Sofia, Bulgaria where I lived until around I was 19. Afterwards I moved to Maastricht, Netherlands and in the last six years or so I have lived predominantly in Asia – mostly Japan, Malaysia, and Korea. At the present I am based in the north-eastern part of Thailand. Here I teach Sanskrit and Classical Tibetan. \nIn Bulgaria I attended the only gymnasium in the country, The National School for Ancient Languages and Cultures “Constantine-Cyril the Philosopher”, where I studied Latin for five years, Ancient Greek for four and Old Slavonic for three. There I specialized in (Western) Philosophy (my lecturers were relatively close-minded and did not considered Eastern thought as philosophy) and Cultural studies. The topic of my thesis (I had to write a 70-page thesis in order to graduate) was “Noise in Music – Analysis of Noise Music”. Sadly after that I stopped practicing Latin and Ancient Greek and have pretty much forgotten them. I plan on starting learning Ancient Greek followed by Latin relatively soon. \nAfter graduating I was admitted in the Philosophy department of Sofia University. I studied there for some time but due to numerous reasons changed to the Eastern Languages department, where I studied Japanese and Classical Chinese. At the same time I started playing music – mostly noise, ambient and drone. Between 2009 and 2011 I had hundreds of concerts thorough Europe with a number of my projects, organized more than 50 shows in Bulgaria and released a couple of albums on mostly tape. In the middle of 2011 I realized that playing music is kind of pointless and decided to stop doing it. \nAfterwards I moved to Japan where I lived for some time mostly studying Japanese and Buddhist philosophy, specializing in the thought of Dogen Kigen and the Kyoto School. Realizing that in order to understand their writings, I need to know their philosophical background, which is mostly Indian (Buddhist) philosophy, I started studying some Indian schools of philosophy, mostly concentrating on Buddhism. Together with that I started learning ancient North Indic languages, such as Pali, different Prakrit, and Sanskrit, concentrating on the last one. While studying Sanskrit I also learned a number of Indic scripts, predominantly North Indian (Gurmukhi, Gujarati, Bengali, Siddham, Lantsa, and others). In the future I plan on studying South Indian languages – Tamil and Telugu. \nAfter learning Sanskrit to a certain degree I started studying Classical Tibetan, both in order to understand the vast commentarial corpus of texts on some of the most important Sanskrit treatise, and to read texts which are extant only in Tibetan translation. At the present I continue learning these two languages as well as teaching their basics to other people. \nThe first time I encountered Stoic philosophy was in the gymnasium in Sofia, where I briefly studied some of the most famous Stoics in Philosophy classes. I also read passages of Marcus Aurelius while studying Koine Greek and a letter or two by Seneca in Latin classes. Yet, at the time I was not that interested in Stoicism and didn’t really pay much attention to them. I even forgot precisely which Seneca letters I read in class.\nMy current interest in Stoicism started while I was studying Japanese Soto Zen and Indian Madhyamaka philosophy. Then in order to understand and compare Dogen’s and Nagarjuna’s understanding of language, I started reading again about some ancient Greek philosophers and their philosophy of language. The first one I read about, although not directly connected with Stoicism, was Pyrrho in the book “Pyrrhonism: How the Ancient Greeks Reinvented Buddhism”, where there is some comparison between his school of thought and the Indian Madhyamaka, especially the Prasangika branch. After that I started reading more and more about Ancient Greek philosophy and became very interested in the study of the Cynic and Stoic schools for I found numerous similarities between them and the Zen thought, the one I am most familiar with. \nOne of first Stoic books I read (and afterwards reread numerous times) is the Discourses of Epictetus. I immediately fell in love with his way of speaking and thinking. I find him to be the most “Zen-like” of all Stoic philosophers I had read for numerous of his admonitions have the same spirit as some of the most famous Zen philosophers like Dogen, Ryokan, Kodo Sawaki. Furthermore, I found many of his advices to be amazing and in a sense “better” than the ones found in Indian philosophy for he does not use such foreign for me (and if I have to be honest, disagreeable) metaphysical concepts as karma and rebirth/transmigration.\nAfter reading the “Discourses”, I read “Meditations” (in a couple of different translations) and, again, found it to be amazing. The language and honesty were at least as stunning as Shantideva’s Bodhicariyavatara or Patrul Rinpoche’s Words of My Perfect Teacher. I found its greatness to lie in its extreme honesty and humility. Reading it was humbling and made me want to read more and more Stoic books and books about Stoicism. \nI also read some of Seneca’s works, like the Letters and others, and enjoyed the majority of them but to be honest I didn’t find them as satisfying as the works of Epictetus and Marcus Aurelius. Still, they were written incredibly well. I have read them only once and therefore need to do it again in order to understand them better. \nTogether with that I read a couple of books on Stoicism like John Sellars’ Stoicism (which I saw is on the reading list of your site), Dan Robertson’s Stoicism and the Art of Happiness, Rene Brouwer’s The Stoic Sage: The Early Stoics on Wisdom, Sagehood and Socrates, Wiliam Irvine’s A Guide to the Good Life: The Ancient Art of Stoic Joy, and a number of others, the nameI also of which I cannot remember. Quite recently I finished Luis Navia’s Diogenes the Cynic: The War Against the World, which I found to be written not very well.\nI also joined the 2014 Stoic Week. \nRegarding religious affiliation I mostly study Buddhist philosophy and languages but wouldn’t call myself a Buddhist. Yet, I am very interested and influenced by Zen Buddhist thought and practice. I don’t know if I would call myself a Stoic, either. About a belief in deities, I think I am agnostic.\nI don’t know what I want to get from the course. I guess I want to learn more about the philosophy and if possibly continue and finish the other courses you offer. This way I will be able to understand Stoicism better.\n\n', 1, '', 0, 0, 0, '', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 'Martin did not commence term 4. Dormant.

It was not long after high school, to be specific, it was during my third semester of college, that I was diagnosed with a rather severe and disabling anxiety/panic disorder. Ultimately, my health, or my lack of adequate tools to combat my illness, forced me to drop out of college. The path that followed only became more destructive, both mentally and physically. 	\n\n	I was self medicating with alcohol and making life choices that would leave many shaking their heads. I found myself jumping from job to job, unable to keep one for very long, at least until my most recent employer. I have been fortunate enough to remain at my current job for nearly six years, but my illness has put me on disability for many months at a time. It has also kept me from working hard to pursue career ambitions.	\n\n	I work full-time as a wastewater treatment operator. I am grateful to have a job, notably one with exceptional health insurance and dental, but my aspirations are far from my current field. I was an emergency medical technician and volunteer firefighter briefly, and I thoroughly enjoyed helping others; although, I would not return to those fields, I aspire to find a career that I find virtuous, or allows/encourages me to be so.	\n\n	I have no religious faith to call my own. I have long considered myself an atheist, but I do have an interest, perhaps partially inspired by the Stoics, in pantheism. I have not studied pantheism as much as I would like, but I look forward to it. It might be relevant to acknowledge that I was raised Catholic.\n\n	I\'ve sought what feels like every type of remedy to restore my lost tranquility; I will not list the plethora of treatment options I\'ve attempted, but only the obvious being psychological and psychiatric. I have found this exceedingly wasteful; I\'m not accusing those who enter the mental health field of not having good intentions, I just find the current progress of treating mental health to be rather stagnant, or sluggish; statistics would surely support my opinion, especially when considering disability in the workforce (N.I.M.H.).\n	\n	The go-to technique of therapy consists of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT,) what the mental health community dubs the "gold standard" treatment for anxiety, and, I believe, other mental illnesses. When considering CBT\'s origin, it\'s amazing how little, generally nothing at all from my experience, that modern mental health professionals are aware of the branch of the philosophy of which they are basically "teaching," in their particular fashion; personally, I would consider that this is a contributing factor that led me to further examine the Stoics myself; I found their guidance to be, alongside the support of my loving family, the only things that kept me going through rough times. I suppose modern psychology/psychiatry wasn\'t a complete waste if it led me to discovering a philosophy that has produced more positive results than visiting the pharmacy.	\n\n	I have read the "big three:" Seneca, Marcus Aurelius, and Epictetus; it\'s unlikely that I\'ll be without a copy of stoic literature on my person (usually the Meditations or Discourses, securely tucked away in my backpack.) I often recommend the Meditations to someone who might have interest, or perhaps a great introductory book such as William B. Irvine\'s A Guide to the Good Life. On a side note, I have found Irvine\'s philosophical literature excellent, and a perfect example of how Stoicism is still breathing.	\n\n	It is a quest of mine to own a hardcover copy of Musonius Rufus, to add to my bookshelf (or backpack,) but I\'ve only come across Cynthia King\'s paperback. Also, in regards to what stoic literature I\'ve read, I\'m also very interested in Cato the Younger\'s life; Cato\'s life is not just remarkably interesting, but also remarkably inspirational! 	\n\n	Before stuffing my bookshelves with hardcover philosophical literature, and plenty of other random books that are worth rereading, I recall my first enlightening experience with philosophy during a basic Philosophy 101 course. My professor was very passionate and enthusiastic. He expressed, over and over, as if to chisel into our youthful and pregnable minds, the very famous quote from Plato\'s Apology: "The unexamined life is not worth living". Although my brief stint in college is mostly forgotten, courtesy of the lack of moderation I had of alcohol, I have yet to forget how much importance the professor gave Socrates\'/Plato\'s quote, and how grateful I am to have heeded those words.			\n\n	Nearly all of my philosophical interest is Hellenistic or ancient Roman, most significantly Stoicism, of course. Perhaps once I have a strong grasp of the ancients, I\'ll venture further along the roll call of philosophers, but I\'m quite comfortable with my current progression. To be fair, I have explored more "modern" philosophy, but find it tremendously boring or unhelpful. \n\n	I\'m not certain that I would label myself as a Stoic. I believe that it\'s fair to say that I practice Stoicism, and that I have benefitted from it; yet, without a mentor, or some form of outside guidance, it doesn\'t quite feel appropriate to classify myself as such. I will admit though, recently during an important social interaction, I had inquired someone\'s feedback on how I handled the interaction, and they replied "Stoic;" perhaps it was very un-Stoic of me to be delighted to hear such a response, but I felt reassurance, for the first time, that my practice was paying off; it immediately led me to start self-examining how else I\'ve benefitted.	\n\n	Overall, my interest in the School of Essential Studies is to experience Stoicism with others, not just by myself anymore. Eventually I\'d like to put my Stoic practice to use more often and efficiently, thereby increasing my quality of life, especially the tranquility that every anxious mind longs for. I desire to gain a better knowledge of the texts, thereby living a more virtuous life. I cannot say I know precisely what I\'m getting myself into, but it feels like I\'ve been waiting to write this essay for years!	\n\n	Thank you for reading my admission essay for the School of Essential Studies.

Understand my existence, the world, the universe.\r\n\r\n—---------\r\n\r\nThe person\r\n\r\nMy encounter with stoicism.\r\n\r\nBeing a unique child under a single-mother parent, at times placed under the care of other foster homes, I was basically on my own, as a loner, to understand how the world is, how to survive it and strive... I did not become a looser or a lost cause.  I did not have many friends, still don\'t, but I have learned to live as a loner; alone productively among others.  As such, I developed some sort of defence mechanism or survival skill or a way by being more distant, stern, strong and serious.  Indirectly, I had learned how to be with myself and within me; be keen & aware of others and my surrounding.  However, I was creating an emotional protective shield against others to avoid being hurt and too involved.  I avoided others.  I was keeping myself distant since I did not know who I really was or liked or wanted... to become someone.\r\n\r\nPrior to knowing stoicism, I practiced the control of my emotions through my years as a youth in development so no one would be able to know me or make myself vulnerable and more pointedly as a competitive weightlifter between the ages of 13 to 22.  As you may understand, competition requires skills to plan a course of action, organize the training schedules, control the diet, know the risks & challenges and avoid being distracted or off track - a winner avoids losing strategies and distractions.  To win requires "no prisoners": not being bogged down by unnecessary items, issues or people - keep it simple and to the point.  This approach demands a reflective inner process that balances the needs and wants or mitigates the reason and the emotional.\r\n\r\nSince weightlifting is an individual sport, I had found something quite adequate for my loner personality and an opportunity to gain social skills nevertheless.  As a side note, I was successful in my country; traveled the world some which allowed me to be more confident, aware of the world and thus more opened to others.  But an awakening grew in me, wanting to feed my inner self that felt empty of an answer: a nagging feeling of wanting to know something of our existence that no questions are able to ask.\r\n\r\nAfter the sport, I continued my college studies, graduated and found a job as a security guard at a university.  Throughout my years at that institution, my curiosity and my duties exposed me to various disciplines in science and humanities... talk about free education!  However,  I became curious enough to search in the various libraries (during the night shifts) and got a good amount of perspective from the most nihilist to the most pantheist.  I therefore registered for an undergraduate degree in political science, police & security management (my career orientation) and criminology & law - meaning, I did not want to know one thing, but all things. I was still my core loner self, but more socially integrated and active until a single event at work kicked in stoicism.\r\n\r\nOn August 24th, 1992, a professor decided to deal with his grievance by shooting at coworkers.  Some were dead, others wounded, many shocked and traumatized. On duty at that time, I responded, survived being shot at, helped some students evacuate and assisted a severely wounded professor who died a month after.  My fellow security guard (my best man years later) was taken hostage and managed to disarm the suspect and the whole event became a media circus until the court cases as it would in North America (sorry for the personal comment).\r\n\r\nOddly enough, the shooting did not hurt me emotionally like most were - although I have the occasional flashbacks when I sleep.  I felt elated about the experience, I had found part of an answer about my existence: I was alive.  Partly, the control of my emotions made me immune to the shock or the event triggered an additional emotional shield, but regardless, I felt quite happy about the experience.  Obviously, surviving the event is part of that happiness, but the other part made me realize I was someone, in something, somewhere in time : I existed, but why?Unfortunately, that intense sense of being was short-lived and through the years, I found myself yearning for that strong feeling of existence... I was addicted to something philosophical.\r\n\r\nToday, a successful career security manager, I help people and businesses prevent & protect their assets and lives.  Married for the past 19 years, we have an 11 year old daughter and live in the same house for over 20 years.  I\'m active as an industry mentor and volunteer as the president of the board for the provincial weightlifting organisation.  I continue my studies and love to read - time permitting though.\r\n\r\nThis is mostly what I am.  Outside of me.\r\n\r\nThe individual\r\n\r\nMy implication with stoicism?\r\n\r\nIt began unbeknownst to me as the loner kid.  Kept to myself, stayed away from others and survived so I could know who I was.  Developing a fertile imagination with fantasies, I came to enjoy music (pop and rock).  Having mostly myself to "talk" to, I learned to think and reflect on my situations and events with seldom an adult to guide me... wisely.  Then came the books.  Comic strips, comic books, Tolkien, Verne, Sherlock Holmes, John Le Carré and Tom Clancy as the years moved on.  Movies helped me reflect and get some entertaining perspective like Harold & Maude, Apocalypse Now, Carl Sagan\'s Cosmos, Being There, Crash and Detachment.  I was building my inner self and learning to be critical.\r\n\r\nIn 1977, I was extremely impressed and influenced by the first Star Wars movie: saw it 10 times.  Being a 10 year old kid, that science-fiction movie imprinted itself in me.  I was in awe (still am) of Darth Vader for the power he effected, the power he wielded and the power he projected.  I\'m sure not to be the only who wants to own a real light sabre ;-). Then, Jedi Master Yoda.  The wisdom of a sage displaying calm certitude, knowledge of the surroundings and equal ability to project power.  The common denominator of both of them: "the force".  Now that got me riveted to a philosophy I kind of believed in even if it was a movie, but it has a stoic flavour for it is "an all encompassing" orientation... everything & nothing.  A Jedi was one with his surroundings and aware of the nature of the force.  I moved on with this concept and fantasy.\r\n\r\nDuring my years as an athlete, stoicism grew in me as an athlete who needed to stay focus and simple to become the best as well as define me.  It introduced itself to me at the university through my curiosity.  It protected me at the shooting.  Professionally, it is my demeanour (I try too) and it brings the trust of my clients and coworkers and strangers... and angers my wife for she believes I don\'t care because I do not readily react emotionally to events.  Obviously, being a lone person makes others think I\'m a psychopath.\r\n\r\nDuring my years of study in political science and law, there was a number of historical events and political philosophy that referred to stoicism.  What impressed me was how "neutral" it seemed to be vis-à-vis humans.  That is, it was more an intellectual approach to understanding than an emotional one.  It seemed less juvenile and more wise.  There were a lot of references from English, French and American philosophers in my classes, but I felt that Greek and Roman philosophers, as well as Hindu, Japanese and Chinese philosophies had reached a level of reflective maturity and historical experience.  In addition, they preceded the Middle Ages and Industrial Revolution so why would I listen to Sartre or Hegel when the true classics of philosophy were WAY before the European birth?\r\n\r\nAs I searched for the core concept of stoicism, I ended up with the most common searched result: Meditations.  And this is when I listened to it as my first Audible book.  Since then, I listened to a number of audio books like The Story of Philosophy, Manual for Life by Epictetus and now going through Will Durant\'s Story of Civilization (volume 4 - the story of faith at the time of this writing) which provided me a very satisfactory understanding, perspective and context of stoicism.  I now know I need to actually read the books to deepen my understanding and learn the way of a stoic.  It is at that time, I came across the Registry on the Internet where I signed in many years ago and now ready to commit the first step as a student and hopefully, a master.\r\n\r\nThis is who I am.

I’ve worked hard ever since. In one since my work ethic is indicative of my slow understanding to accept things not within my control: I always thought I could outwork any problem or situation. When I started my business after college, I only took off two or three days a year for seven years. I’m less stubborn now.\n\nMy parents were alcoholics, and they taught me to hate holidays. I coped by internalizing my emotions and listening far more than talking. While I could not control every aspect of my environment, I sought out all the variables; if I could not have absolute control, at least I was not surprised by what happened. This tendency created a craving for information and explanation. It seemed that I was always at the foreground of trying to unlock a mystery. One of my earliest memories is of lying in my bed, frustrated (at something) and asking over and over again, “Why?” “Why?”\n\nMy older sister took a turn towards the East, in yogic meditation and Hinduism. I was curious. As a junior in high school my turn was toward evangelical Christianity, leading to a BA in biblical literature at Azusa Pacific University. Before I knew it, I was 22, married, and bound for Fuller Theological Seminary. But I wavered. Something inside me did was not resonating, was not feeling right. Not that I discounted a path of ministry for someone else, but that path was not right for me. Three weeks before I was to start seminary, I moved to Idaho to buy a house and sell insurance with my brother.\n\nI discovered first-hand the difficulty of trying to make a living off the Idaho scenery during the recession of the 1980s. After a three-year stint as insurance salesman, graveyard motel clerk, janitor, KFC worker, and office supplies salesman, I moved back with my wife to southern California in 1985 with a plan to open a new business.\nThe next 12 years were a blur, starting and growing a family and busines, seemingly “too busy for church,” seeking fulfillment elsewhere by continuing my studies at UC California, Irvine and writing classes at local junior colleges. Along the way, I read poetry, literary criticism, and philosophy (existentialists foremost). \n\nAfter receiving news of the sale, demolition, and rebuilding of the complex my business was located in, I explored several options to relocate...but in the end I elected to return to school to get my English teaching credential, a move far more in keeping with my temperament than the owner of a commercial and retail office supply company.\n\nWith the good fortune of several job offers after graduation, I was hired in a district that offered the International Baccalaureate Program. Within a few years, I was teaching at a school that offered a Theory of Knowledge class; I’ve been teaching the class for the past 14 years. It was in the early years of teaching this class that I first remember encountering an essay on Stoicism: “Epictetus on Happiness.” The lasting impression was (and continues to be) his discernment on things we can and cannot control. During these years I also began to read more liberally-oriented thinkers on Christianity and process thought and philosophy (A.N. Whitehead). I was able to funnel this interest into a MA program in humanities, writing my thesis on a philosophy of religion topic, Critical Realism and Christian mysticism.  \n\nSolutions were offered, but I was not finding anything definitive, nothing resonating as entirely workable or satisfying. At this point I began readings in Buddhism and Zen Buddhism in particular. While I was still unsettled regarding my general worldview, I did recognize that I could aim for peace and tranquility--a philosophy of life. It was in this context that I sought out other philosophies valuing tranquility, e.g., Stoicism. I began to see many connections between Buddhism and Stoicism, and I came across William B. Irvine’s Guide to the Good Life: The Ancient Art of Stoic Joy. I’m on my third read through the book, and I’ve also read portions of Seneca, Rufus, Epictetus, and Marcus Aurelius. \n\nIn context, after my divorce two years ago, I was needing to focus on an actual practice of tranquility, and I began to attempt to apply some of the Stoic techniques and mindsets I garnered from Irvine’s text: negative visualization, voluntary discomfort, learning to like what I have, etc. I’m encouraged and I’m getting result in more skillfully managing my life and goals. \n\nI’m still unsettled; but less so. As Irvine points out numbers times, Stoicism is not the most popular thought in today’s world, nor is it adequately understood. I am wanting to study, learn, and integrate the wisdom of Stoic thought and practice for the betterment of myself, my acquaintances (in being a better person myself and potentially sharing Stoic principles), and in the broader culture. With so many competing worldviews and philosophies, with so much unrest and violence in the world, I truly believe that the message of Stoicism is sorely needed.\n\nThe nature of this introductory essay is severely limited, merely hinting in the slightest way of who I am and what I value. What continues to resonate with me, however, is the maxim to “Live in accordance with Nature.” In part, this maxim aligns with my personal creed to live in accordance with the Reality principle, understanding and accepting Reality and living according to its Truth, uncomfortable or otherwise.\n\nI want to understand and see Reality as I was meant to be, lived out within myself and my community.

I think. At the very least it’s really easy for me to just get screwed up every night. The alcohol was never the important part. I used to ingest anything that would alter my mind. Alcohol being the easiest to acquire soon became my go to drug of choice. Soon I became physically addicted. And for a long time, I didn’t care. I drank in the mornings. I made it to work, where I drank in secret. I came home and got obliterated while aimlessly browsing the internet, looking for something to distract me from my life. Following the path of least resistance into mind-numbing blackouts every night.\n\nThen, by chance, about ten months ago, I stumbled upon the book Philosophy for Any Life (Zachary G. Augustine). It wasn’t an instant conversion.  No beam of light shone down from the heavens and made me not want a drink. I don’t imagine life is ever that nice and easy, no matter how much I want it to be. But it did spark something in my mind that I am still trying to hone. A process where I can acknowledge the craving that I am having, accept that I am having it, and let it go as much as possible. That was enough.\n\nThe next few months were the hardest. There was shaking. There was nausea. There was vomiting. Nothing was so unbearable when I could get a few seconds of relief by distancing myself within my own mind. I haven’t been perfect. I’ve slipped a few times. I’ve had about five liters of hard liquor in the past nine months, compared to six liters every week previously. I’ve come to terms with constant improvement requiring imperfection.\n\nAbout four months ago, I purchased a copy of Meditations (Marcus Aurelius). The raw format of a journal seems to make it easier to make a human connection. It seems insane to me that someone like me can make a connection with an emperor from two millennia ago. And yet, here I am, marveling at the beautiful insanity that is this universe we inhabit. A sense of marvel that has been missing for a very long time.\n\nI should probably back up a bit. I grew up in a small Minnesotan town. I was isolated. Not isolated by force, but instead circumstance. There’s only so much social interaction you can have when your nearest neighbors are almost a mile away. There’s even fewer peers you can have when there aren’t more than ten children within twenty miles of you.  There was lot of religion around me, but not much in the home. I considered myself an atheist. I still do, in the sense that I do not believe in any of the traditional deities I have encountered as of yet. Further than that I am unsure. Without a church or close peers, I had no real sense of community. I kept my head down. I was content to make my way through life doing what I was supposed to. I graduated high school in 2008 and made my way into a state school later that same year.\n\nIn 2009, something inside me gave up. I started abusing every drug I could find. I coasted through a few more years of college. The coursework was easy enough, but my heart wasn’t in it. The prospect of a lucrative tech job that I could force myself through every day just to go home and drink myself into oblivion was not enough to keep me on the path I had been on for so long. In late 2011, I dropped out of the program that I was in. I decided to cut out the middle and just drink myself to death. I continued this for several years, hoping each night would be my last. It never really occurred to me that I would survive longer than six months, but somehow I did. Life seems to be funny that way, it never seems to go exactly as I expect.\n\nSince picking up Augustine and Aurelius whatever I had inside of me that gave up seems to be stirring again. Small at first, but enough. And with each day it seems to grow stronger. I have done cursory research into several philosophies (Buddhism, Catholicism, Islam, Judaism and Shinto). None of it to any real depth beyond Wikipedia and one or two books on the subject, but none of these has struck me in the ways that Stoicism has. \nI hope to add Seneca to this list soon, but my attention has been diverted these past few months cleaning up the mess I made for myself. It’s fitting, in a way, life taught me a lesson no academic school ever did. A lesson I probably needed to learn before finding any meaning in academics. I’ve tackled everything in life as one big project. The idea that was in the back of my mind being that if I tick the boxes and do enough of the work, that I can rest afterwards. This left me burned out after everything I did, and that unnecessary rest always lasted far too long. I don’t think that life can be tackled that way. It is my view, as of now, that life requires constant and sustained action of both will and restraint to achieve anything useful.  \n\nI am unsure if mine is the stoic path or this is just one step on my journey, but I wish to learn more. I will learn more, but I require guidance. It is this guidance that I hope your school can provide. I am not applying to this school to be saved. I wish to find someone who can help me understand this philosophy, two shards of which have already given me the tools to change my life so much. It is my hope that at this school I will find such a person. I would like to thank the college for even considering my application. \n\nI also wish to apologize to whoever reads this rambling mess, but it is what is in my heart and it seems unwise to submit anything else.', 1, '', 0, 0, 0, '', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', 1, 0, '', '');

I was in junior high school at the time and had developed an interest in philosophy. My grandfather had owned paperback copies of some of the basic texts of Greek and Roman philosophy, and after his death, they somehow landed in my parents’ home.  I thought I would give them a try, and my parents encouraged me.\n\nThe first volume in the set that caught my attention was “Plato/Epictetus/Marcus Aurelius”. I dove in, but struggled with “The Golden Sayings of Epictetus” and couldn’t get past the first book of Marcus Aurelius’ Meditations. I was delighted, however, with Plato’s Apology and the account of Socrates’ death in Phaedo.\n\nYears later, when I turned 18, time came for me to register for selective service. I thought a lot about what that might mean for me, especially given the world situation at that time. By the end of the following year, President Reagan would have sent troops to invade Grenada. During an idle moment, I picked up the familiar volume of Harvard Classics and read Crito. Instantly I felt my anxiety disappear. Socrates, invited to flee his death sentence, chose to remain. The logic was unassailable. Like Socrates, I had been nurtured by my country of birth, and if there was an implicit bargain to risk my own life, wasn’t that only fair?\n\nI read and enjoyed Plato’s dialogues in college and many times afterward, even getting audiobook versions to better enjoy the drama. (The versions recorded for Naxos Audiobooks are very entertaining) But I did not revisit the other authors in my favorite volume of Harvard Classics until much later. \n\nAbout three years ago, I hit a point in my life where I felt spiritually and emotionally adrift. I had tried several forms of meditation, but they all proved to be dead ends. No matter how long I sat, I still felt off-key and disconnected. and landed finally on the Contemplative Prayer method adapted by Father Thomas Keating from the early Christian Mystics. This method proved immediately fruitful, and I became interested in Catholicism as a result. I sympathized with the methods of the Desert Fathers and their rough, stark, heavily mystical version of Christianity. This was an intensely personal, visionary take on religion; no rigid orthodoxy or complicated doctrine. Here I found early Universalists, men who committed physically and mentally with their path, but were also highly inclusive and open. \n\nThe mystical portion of my spiritual journey came to a climax at a retreat at a Benedictine monastery. I was there just after Easter, and the Paschal candle, representing the risen Christ, was lit in the center of the small room where the monks sat in prayer. Retreatants were allowed to join them in their prayers, and as I sat on my bench, I felt a strong pull toward the symbol of the candle flame. It was very powerful, and I decided I must become a Catholic in order to experience the full extent of the mystic vision.\n\nAccordingly, I jumped through the many hoops required to become a Catholic in the Vatican 2 era. It is a multi-step process, taking many months of catechismal instruction and group ceremonies, not to mention filling out forms and providing various kinds of documentation.\n\nDuring an early stage of this process, I read James Martin’s book on Ignatian Spirituality, “The Jesuit Guide to Almost Everything”. This inspired me to attempt the famous Spiritual Exercises of Saint Ignatius, a highly mystical journey through Catholic spirituality that presumably would land me on a new plane of philosophical detachment combined with the ability to see God in all things. \n\nI got halfway through this process, and hit a gigantic roadblock. The mystic energy I had been coasting on, suddenly dried up. There are exercises where the participant must imagine conversations with Christ. How they would progress, how the relationship would develop through the discussion. But the line went dead. I had nothing to say, and could not imagine a response from the other end.\n\nWorse for me, I felt weak – simply weak. All of my seeking, all the heavy mysticism, left me weary and vulnerable and without a clue how to proceed. Meanwhile I had a happy marriage to support and a demanding job to keep. I had to find something soon, before either suffered from my internal struggles.\n\nI picked up a book by the author of popular philosophy books, Alain de Botton, on the nature of work in the modern era. I liked this so much that I bought a four volume collection from his website, impressively titled “Truth”. One of these volumes was “Straw Dogs”, by British philosopher John Gray. It was a devastating criticism of Humanistic philosophy, which followed secularism fearlessly through all its implications. In a non-human centered cosmos, it argued at one point, without meaning or rationality, why might our “purpose” be the survival of the microorganisms we host? Why might our intellectual achievements and scientific and technical progress be nothing more than a way of keeping us alive and multiplying so that we could keep our special bacteria colonies afloat? Of course, against this there is no argument. We imagine a human-centered universe because we are humans, not because we have arrived at that notion through scientific or philosophical inquiry. \n\nAnother volume in the series was a contemporary translation of Marcus Aurelius. As I read this, I began to feel stronger and happier. I started to devise a plan where I would read the basic stoic texts according to the ancient Christian practice of Lectio Divina, where a passage is read four times with different attitudes or actions. I searched the internet and found the site for the College of Stoic Philosophers. I decided to read the recommended texts: Discourses and Handbook of Epictetus, the Penguin edition of Seneca’s selected “Letters from a Stoic”, and the Meditations.\n\nThis was nearly a year ago, and I completed the Discourses and the Handbook using this method, meditating and journaling all the way. I also was confirmed in the Catholic faith. Straw Dogs had burned away my last remaining attachments to secular humanism and with them any remaining philosophical barriers to Theism. The ceremonies and symbols of Catholicism seemed to fill in a gap in Epictetus – he urges us to praise God, and the church provides me with a mechanism to do that.\n\nThe mix is not perfect. Much of Catholicism is alien to my nature, and my conversion in mid-life means that I have little in common socially with my fellow Christians. Despite the sense that Catholic ceremonies “complete” my stoic orientation, I struggle with the notion that I might be Stoic first and Christian second. And what would that mean? \n\nI apply to the SES program hoping that a comprehensive instruction will help me resolve these conflicts, but I have a more practical reason for wanting to join. My wife and I adopted a baby boy this year, and I have just received a new career opportunity working with business intelligence systems and software – I am 51, so I am very concerned about meeting the challenges of parenthood and career as I confront the aging process. I believe I can use, even need, the strength of character that Stoicism can provide, to help make me a good example for my son and a productive and creative force for my employer.\n\n\n\n\n', 1, '', 0, 0, 0, '', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', 0, 0, '', ''),

Not surprising. My father was a bigamist, alcoholic and abuser. My mother was schizophrenic and was institutionalized while I was a teenager. When I was eleven, I managed to go away to a private military school where I was beaten and molested for most of 6th grade. I have to laugh because it had no psychological impact on me. To me, being molested or turning on a light switch had about the same emotional impact. I learned from the age of 3 that bigger people will do whatever they want to you so get with the program and find ways to disappear. I was glad to be away from my parents and twice a week “sessions” were a small price to pay for some degree of freedom.  When I was 19, the State of New York took my son from me because they did not recognize the parental rights of unmarried men. This was all a “blessing”? because it cut me from any connection to normal life. I laugh when I see “Law and Order” episodes with molested people in the gallery. For me it was the high point of my youth. \n\nI read about Siddhartha becoming the Buddha and decided in my mid twenty’s to see if I could become enlightened. I ended up in a Gurdjieff school in 1976-77 run by Pierre Elliott. \n\nI never did become a holy man but learned “decision” from Pierre which lead me to acquire 3 master’s degrees in business and 4 financial licenses. I ended up with the highest score ever recorded for a California financial exam taken thousands of times. I work as a commercial real estate appraiser. Essentially a career based on “knowing myself” and “right aim”. I would rather have been almost anything else but I am so good at what I do that it must have been destiny. I was working on my 3rd Masters degree program and was tempted to quit thinking I had done enough. However it was “decision” and I could not give up. The 2nd to last course was real estate appraisal. I often wonder what I would be doing if I had quit the 3rd program as “superfluous” \n\nRecently my father gave my $1,000,000 inheritance to my half-brother. Besides the financial impact, it made me realize that my whole life had been a lie. That is quite a gift and few people can discover at the age of 66 that their whole life as it related to their parents had been an illusion. I knew the man had no honor as he used to bring his whores into our house on Christmas Eve regularly. I am glad that he gift wrapped me for pedophiles as it eliminated the terror that most molested children receive. It was really no big deal. He engaged in serious physical and psychological abuse from the age of 3. Not quit cigarettes put out on my back but possibly worse. From that point on, anything was possible and surrender to the universe was the best option. \n\nAbout 5 years ago, I developed a fascination with the 2nd Punic War and even corresponded with Adrian Goldsworthy. I expanded my search to include a study of Roman history and heard of an advisor to Nero named Seneca. That this man’s thoughts could be read today was a blessing. I have since read parts of the Enchiridion, Letters from a Stoic and half of Meditations. I consider Marcus Aurelius my teacher and realize that this tragic journey was the foundation for my study of Stoicism. Both my parents are 96 and still causing trouble so I think I have time for this new career. \n \nMy goal is to be a real man as described in Meditations. I wish to live honorably. I am a good husband and father, having a perfect “reverse barometer” (as Custer said in the movie Little Big Man) in my father. I have discovered that this 3 generations of fathers abusing their first born ends with me. \n\nI am proud to have withstood this life abuse. I know that I can do better and have not always been the perfect Stoic. Years ago I was close to converting to Islam, mostly for the practice of praying 5 times a day, often in a group. I wanted to change my name to Rahim, or Allah the Merciful. They wanted to name be Mohammed (blessings and peace be upon him) but that did not work for me. I a sense, my work for Mercy continued on. In the Philokalia Volume 3, Illias the Presbyter in his Gnomic Anthology says “A truly merciful person is not one that deliberately gives away superfluous things but on who forgive those that deprive him of what he needs” My work on forgiveness continues. It is the gift you give yourself. \n\nI have been a semazen trained by the Mevlevi Sheik Jelleddin Loras. I have worked with Zikr, fasting, vigil, meditation, movements, decision, sensation, centering prayer, and other disciplines. It all sounds good in 2 dimensions but I am still an “ill roasted egg” as Shakespeare says…”all on one side.”\n\nThe work continues. My reading of Meditations is a great blessing. I know that this book would not have been meaningful a few years back when I could taste my $1,000,000 and settle in to a life of leisure. As it stands, my financial life is OK and will create the need to work another 10 years or live in a trailer.\n\nI do not consider myself a Stoic because I get pissed off to easily. I only started reading this material in the past year. I grew up a Catholic and have dabbled in other religions. I have an affinity with Mary and the Centering Prayer but I not sure it matters at this point.  \n\nI look forward to this work. \n\n\nWilliam Thomas Dunlap, III\n\nThis was 1,000 words. \n\nWell he goes the Band of Brothers Soliloquy from Henry the 5th. \n\n"And what is he that wishes so?

I took Catholicism on faith as a child, went through a period of doubts in my early teens, but came back to it late in high school. So smitten was I at that point, in fact, that my first year of college (\'77-\'78) was spent studying in the pre-novitiate program of the Congregation of Holy Cross. I was preparing to join them as a "brother." Holy Cross is a professed order of priests and brothers (with vows of poverty, chastity, and obedience) whose ministry is teaching, mostly in Catholic high schools around the country; they also founded and still operate Notre Dame University. \n\nAfter that initial year, I decided not to continue with Holy Cross, and a few years later I fell away from the Church entirely. Over the years, I have returned to Catholicism, or tried to, several times, but it\'s never really taken. I married a devoted Catholic woman in a Catholic wedding ceremony, and we raised our two (now adult) children in the Church (though my own ambivalence and the restless, questing nature of my spiritual outlook kept me from being anything like an ideal Catholic father). My wife remains a completely devoted Catholic, and, to my mind, the best kind of religious practitioner--a deeply good person, engaged and active in the community, and committed to the highest ethical ideals. Our children are no longer churchgoers, nor am I. Most of our friends and social circle are Catholic, and I frequently help my wife with her volunteer duties around the parish. But it\'s been a long time since I have shared their faith. \n\nAt the same time, I wholeheartedly reject the currently fashionable disdain for anything to do with religion. Our spiritual heritage is a key component of our cultural DNA, a formative element of Western civilization that has played a crucial role in giving us everything from the likes of Shakespeare, Mozart, Newton, and Einstein (and my own good parents) to a heritage that’s absolutely packed full of wisdom and insight, as well as a palpable sense of the transcendent aspect of the mystery of life. Mankind\'s religious/spiritual heritage, in addition to achieving untold positive impact in everything from education to medicine, to science (yes, science) and social reform, also reaches intellectual, philosophical, and psychological depths that we\'ll never get to the bottom of. Almost incidentally, that same spiritual heritage has also provided rich fodder for the arts for a few thousand years. Those who would dismiss the world\'s entire religious history with a wave of the hand—"oh, that\'s just a bunch of flakes worshipping their invisible friend in the sky"--are simply deaf and blind on the subject. They have missed 99 percent of the significance and value of the world\'s spiritual traditions. \n\nIt seems relevant to mention here that although I\'ve had a complicated and often unsatisfactory relationship with organized religion, I have never been an atheist. I have also never been a card-carrying practitioner of any religion other than Catholicism. I\'ve found wisdom in many traditions, including Buddhism and Vedanta, which has been called the philosophical foundation of Hinduism and "affirms the oneness of existence, the divinity of the soul, and the harmony of religions." \n\nIn the mid-1980s, I came across the book Meditation, by Eknath Easwaran. He wrote from within the Hindu/Vedanta tradition, but with a fundamentally ecumenical outlook. That book made a great impression on me, and it (along with the author\'s other writings and talks) has been an enduring influence for the last thirty years. Easwaran boiled the spiritual life down to its essence, and I found his sensible approach a real aid to developing a mature and useful spiritual outlook. Most importantly, what I got from reading Easwaran was a broader and more relaxed perspective on the whole pursuit. He cut through a lot of the cultural bric-a-brac and mystical arcana that surrounds most religions, highlighted the core truths that seem to lie at the heart of most of them, and showed me a simpler way forward that made sense to me. (One of the oldest scriptures in the world, a key Hindu text called the Rig Veda, which pre-dates the Bible by some 1800 years, says “Truth is one; people call it by different names.” That was one of the fundamental ideas Easwaran introduced me to and that has really stuck with me.) \n\nVedanta\'s idea of God is the orthodox Hindu notion—that the deep inner “self” of each of us is one and the same, all part of the one unified “Self” of the universe, which is Brahman (God). It\'s the "Perennial Philosophy," basically, which Wikipedia describes as "a perspective in the philosophy of religion which views each of the world\'s religious traditions as sharing a single, universal truth on which foundation all religious knowledge and doctrine has grown." \n\nAs interesting as all this was, and is, to me, I\'ve never had an interest in "practicing" any of the Eastern religions; I\'m too much a child of Western culture. (I did spend a month in the late 90s in a Tibetan Buddhist monastery in Kathmandu, researching a writing project, but that\'s another story.) But since I first understood it, the idea of the Perennial Philosophy has always seemed eminently reasonable to me. We all spring into this world from the same source, a source that is ultimately mysterious, yes, but that provided us with rationality, with at least some elements of a common moral framework, and with (largely) shared ideas about human fulfillment. Every religious or spiritual tradition develops within a specific culture, which is why they can look so different--but they are all expressions and developments (cultural accretions, let\'s say) developed around a single, shared, core truth. The English philosopher John Cottingham, in his book Why Believe?, states the situation concisely:\n\n"As we struggle through life, we seem compelled to acknowledge, sooner or later, that human good, our flourishing and fulfilment, depends on orienting ourselves towards values that we did not create. Love, compassion, mercy, truth, justice, courage, endurance, fidelity--all belong to the core of key virtues that all the world’s great religions (and the secular cultures that have emerged from them) recognize, and which command our allegiance whether we like it or not. We may try to go against them, to live our lives without reference to them, but such attempts are always, in the end, self-defeating and productive of misery and frustration rather than human flourishing." \n\nMy turn toward Stoicism came shortly after I started delving into Western philosophy, probably ten or twelve years ago, first with Marcus Aurelius, then Epictetus. My long preamble, above, will perhaps explain Stoicism\'s appeal to me: Here was a worldview, an ethic, and a way of life that offered a largely satisfying philosophical/ethical framework for human action, as well as a few simple, sensible, but not over-elaborated notions about our divine origins and mankind\'s spiritual "oneness." It chimed well with those parts of Eastern spiritual/philosophical traditions that made most sense to me, and it also offered something like the best parts of Judeo-Christian ethics but without the need for ritual, dogma, doctrine, revelation, or the required "leap of faith." Stoicism offered a philosophical/spiritual approach to life that was derived from and devoted to clear thinking, open to discussion/debate, free of superstition, and a good match for my temperament. Like many modern-day seekers, the more I looked into it, the more it became apparent that I had been on a Stoic-like path all along.\n \nI don\'t call myself a Stoic, but that\'s only because I\'ve never been happy with labels and I\'m not much of a joiner. For now I just want to keep studying. I want to improve my practice and my understanding and see where it leads. I\'m hopeful that the courses at the College of Stoic Philosophers can help with those goals. I\'m also looking forward to a little "philosophical fellowship"; I\'m not on social media, and my friends aren\'t interested in this subject, so I will enjoy the opportunity to discuss these ideas with a like-minded "prokopton."\n\nBOOK LIST\nStoicism-related I\'ve read include:\nDiscourses, Epictetus, in a couple different translations.\nMeditations, Marcus Aurelius, in multiple translations.\nDialogues and Essays, Seneca\nLetters Vol I: 1-65, Seneca\nWhat is Ancient Philosophy?, Hadot\nPhilosophy as a Way of Life, Hadot\nStoicism, Sellars\nHellenistic Philosophy, Long\nEpictetus: A Stoic and Socratic Guide to Life, Long\nStoicism and the Art of Happiness, Robertson\nPhilosophy for Life, Evans\nA Guide to the Good Life, Irvine\n\nBOOKS ON HAND (some that I\'ve not read entirely but that I use for reference and occasional dipping-into):\nHellenistic Philosophy, Inwood and Gerson\nThe Hellenistic Philosophers, Long and Sedley\nA few different books from Cicero, some Plato, some Aristotle. \n\n', 1, '', 0, 0, 0, '', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', 1, 0, '', ''),

My father was a Police Officer and mum stayed at home to raise my older brother and I. Sadly my brother died in 2007. Our family moved around quite a bit in my early years but we eventually settled in Mansfield, a small market town in Nottinghamshire. I had a happy childhood and left secondary school aged sixteen. I tried various jobs until eventually, aged 25, I joined the police force and subsequently ‘found my niche’ as a dog-handler. Unfortunately a  nervous breakdown necessitated my early retirement in 1997, having served for twenty two years. It was after my breakdown, and in an attempt to get off medication, that I developed an interest in meditation, yoga and philosophy - and that interest continues today.\r\n\r\nFollowing my  return to full health some twelve months later I turned to self-employment. I ran my own Driving School for a time, and then went on to become a Driving Examiner, working on contract to the then UK Driving Standards Agency. Later an opportunity arose to buy a village pub which had been closed for some time. It was after we built the business and then sold it as a going concern that I was able to study for a degree at Lincoln University. After gaining a BA (English) I worked as a Welfare Officer in a secondary school until last year when I  finally retired - again - and this time for good!  I have been happily married to Stephanie for the past eighteen years and we have four children and fifteen grandchildren between us - with one son and youngest grandchild living in NZ. Steph and I now live in Lincoln and I enjoy walking my dog, yoga, reading, fishing when the weather is fine and singing in a Barbershop Chorus.\r\n\r\nA great part of my childhood in the 1950’s revolved around the parish church. I was a member of the Boys Brigade and sang in the choir. However as I grew older and into my late teens the church became less relevant and by the time I joined the police force in 1975 my then wife and I had moved away from Mansfield and religion had no part in my life. But it was whilst on my way home from work in the early hours of one morning in 1982 that I had a religious experience, a ‘Damascus Road’ moment and as a consequence I became a committed and enthusiastic Christian.\r\n\r\nI was a committed Christian for many years. After a time spent in the Charismatic/Evangelical tradition I eventually converted to Catholicism, but it was shortly after this that I divorced and left the Church altogether. My divorce (after twenty five years of marriage) and subsequent re-marriage to Steph made me question the  faith I professed and the promises it claimed hold and I realised that for me it was empty, and I walked away. \r\n\r\nI could not however, try as I might, confess to being an atheist. I retained a conviction, a sense of the ‘spiritual’ in my life and after a time of floundering around in a maize of contradictory thoughts and ideas I came upon Thomas Paine’s The Age of Reason, and loved it. I loved his style of prose and use of language but it also put ‘all the ducks in a row’  as to where I am spiritually. At the time of publication his work attracted a considerable amount of criticism and condemnation, and still does in many quarters, but I have not yet come across any Christian apologist who I feel satisfactorily answers the questions he raises, especially with regard to the means and authenticity of divine revelation and I am quite comfortable now, if asked, to describe myself as a Deist. \r\n\r\nI became interested in Stoicism four years ago after reading about James Bond Stockdale, particularly the time he spent in captivity in North Vietnam. It is generally held that Stoicism has an appeal to the ‘military’ mindset and having had two years in the Territorial Army in my early twenties and a career in the Police Force I suppose it was inevitable it would have an appeal to me. As a consequence I have read more about Stoicism than any other school of thought. Apart from any number of articles and blogs on the subject I have also read ; \r\nSeneca - Letters from a Stoic - Penguin Classics                              \r\nSeneca - Dialogues and Essays - Oxford World Classics\r\nMarcus Aurelius Meditations - Penguin Classics\r\nEpictetus - Selected Writings - Penguin Classics\r\nEpictetus, The Enchiridion (trans. Higginson)\r\nStoicism - Sellars\r\nA Guide to the Good Life - Irvine \r\nStoic Serenity (A practical course to finding inner peace) - Seddon \r\nCourage Under Fire - Stockdale\r\n\r\nMy favourite Stoic however, without doubt is Seneca. I enjoy his prose style, his humour and his, at times, acerbic wit. Like Seneca I am wont to cross over into the enemy camp once in awhile to have a scout around and despite being AWOL I still spend quite a bit of time in the Christian theology camp. For instance I’ve recently taken Bertrand Russell\'s  \'History of Western Philosophy\' off the the shelf once more and am I’m looking at Catholic philosophy.  I occasionally have a look at various other philosophical ism’s, but it’s only the Stoics that have actually had any significant effect on the way I see the world and live my life. The basic tenets of Stoicism have given me a ‘moral compass’ and an inner strength which carried me through a prolonged and chronic illness last year when I had major surgery to alleviate the effects of Crohn’s Disease - a complaint that has dogged me for many years. (I accept that Virtue is the only good, all else is indifferent, nonetheless I hold to there being ‘preferred indifferents’, and good health is certainly one of them!)\r\n\r\nAs for why I want to do this course ? Though I am aware of the basic tenets of I do not know that I would yet regard myself as a Stoic. I hope this tutored guided course, with assignments and deadlines will further my knowledge and thus deepen my understanding and consequently improve my practice. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n', 1, '', 1, 0, 0, '', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 'Smith left Logic term, then returned', '', 1, 0, '', ''),

She has a very tough job treating cancer patients at different stages with radiation treatments and providing MRI services for follow up treatments and planning. This is a job I know it takes a special person for, who is able detach from their emotions knowing many of your patients won’t make it many more years. But with the treatment they provide, they are able to prolong the patients lives and give them quality extension of time to spend with their families. I can’t express enough how grateful I am for this woman in my life.\n\n\nAs for me I am an owner operator of route sales operation for Bimbo Bakeries. I own a territory in Clemmons and Advance, NC. I have the distribution rights to Arnold, Thomas, Sara Lee, Entenmans, Boboli, Sunbeam and Bimbo product lines in all local major grocery stores and restaurants. I have been doing this now for almost 18 years and enjoy being my own boss. It has its ups and downs as most careers do, but I have been able to supply a good life for my family.\n\n\nI have always been outgoing and inquisitive. I enjoy learning new things and pushing myself to acquire new knowledge. Now that the kids are almost grown and I’m entering the next stage of life, I start to have questions about the future and the world around me. I know now that time grows more precious and to learn as much about this life as I can before my time is up. I was born in a little coal mine town in VA, to say I was in the Bible belt is a major understatement. I went to everything from snake handling ceremonies, hell and brimstone, talking in tongues and dancing in the isles to remove demons. So we were forced to believe one way the Bible taught us and that was the only answer. Believe it or live in total damnation for the rest of eternity. I was able to finally leave this area and get away from the Southern Baptist first to TN and then a brief couple years in Colorado then to my final destination in North Carolina. It has been eye opening, TN had a few more religions and then we get to Colorado and find a whole new world. Pagan, Muslim, Christian, Jewish and many more. It was interesting to go and explore all these new views of creation and existence, to see how similar and different they were. It was nice to find other views besides the ones I grew up seeing.\n\n\n Now we classify as non denominational Christians, we don’t go to any one church often. My wife and myself both believe in a higher power, in her line of work we have seen many unexplainable healings of patients that should have died but do to some outside force they have beat this terrible disease. It is hard not to say that there is a guiding hand somewhere in our universe. I think this is what draws me to Stoicism the belief in logos and virtue. This is one of the reasons I am wanting to explore this realm of thinking on a new level. I have been using many of the guiding principles as of late to help me deal with daily stress and annoyances. I have always been a bit quick tempered and I feel like the words of Seneca and Marcus Aurelius have helped to keep me calm. I read new passages daily from Meditations as well the many Stoic websites that post and discuss the issues they face and how these passages help them as well. It is nice to see how others face and deal with their problems using Stoic philosophy. I can’t call myself a Stoic yet but I am trying to live the Stoic life. Everyday I find a new challenge and find myself catching my thoughts and saying what would Marcus do in this situation and how could I handle it differently.   \n\n\nCurrently I am reading :\n\n\nMeditations: A new translation by Gregory Hays\n\n\nStoicism: Cure stress, anger, panic, depression and anxiety with Stoicism\nPoul West\n\n\nStocism The Ultimate Handbook to stoic philosophy, wisdom and way of life\nThomas Beckett\n\n\nI have finished already:\nStoicism for beginners: Transform your life with Stoic Philosophy, habits and knowledge from Marcus Aurelius and Seneca\n\n\nI started being interested in Greek and Roman philosophy after taking an honors course in high school on greek mythology. I really enjoyed the tles and have continues to read the tales to this day. \n\n\nFrom this class I hope to learn how to continue to channel my anger and anxiety productively. Learn to have inner peace by deflecting feelings that aren\'t constructive and useful to my life. Continue to understand what the great teachers are saying, I believe I have much to learn and share as  I get a better understanding. I look forward to talking with a mentor and learning from people who have studied the philosophies in depth. To be able to talk in depth and learn i feel is priceless. \n', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, '', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', 1, 0, '', ''),

I feared of everything and felt that had to manage luck somehow. Some unlucky events in my short-life time at that moment, completely obliterated me. So I felt that opposing to acceptance I had to take part and start struggling on how to avoid future issues. That way I started developing practically unconsciously a high-demanding superstitious and ritualistic structure around my daily basis. Time after I discovered I was facing what it is psychologically called and Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder.\n\nI started an odyssey of therapists and therapies: doubtful-CBT practitioners, brief strategic therapists, Gestalt, pure cognitive, etc… but any of them cause some significant change in my life.\n\nUntil I discovered that paradoxically trying to flee from adversity instead of managing and accepting it, could be the root cause: At that point I discovered a basic CBT technique that despite was main topic around CBT therapies, was not proudly used by all CBT practitioners. Instead, I found later, that they feared this technique because most believed that was going to be negative for their patients (and oddly enough, I also discovered that most of the patients were not prepared for this and will end fleeing when they discovered what does it takes to progress in this type of disorders). So the solution most of the time for this type of patients, was administering psycho-drugs.\n\nAfter deepening in diverse therapies, I started to discover that most of the techniques used on therapy were not original foundations. I could not see this more clearly, until late 2014 when after a huge research I could design a full diagram to see better the whole picture. \n\nFor example I found that Paradoxical Intention from Victor Frankl was a copy of Negative Visualization from ancient philosophies.\n\nAt that point, after further reading of various therapies like Exposure and Response Prevention (voluntary renunciation), or Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (dichotomy of control essence and virtue ethics), I felt that a piece was missing, like a puzzle unresolved: Most of it confluent in one specific issue: The dichotomy of control and the risk taking mechanism in human psychology, and also the absence of determined values to focus in life.\n\nTherapies are useful because they show a clear mechanism for people that do not want to deepen (and read most importantly) in more deep knowledge about themselves and the universe around. But ultimately I found that not knowing “why” shall or not shall be done something, might end in a relapse in any disorder sooner or later. Actually having a disorder was not required to have a complete miserable life based on same causes.\nSo I started going forward in the pursuit of that self-knowledge discipline: In the way I found an author, a world reference in risk-taking decisions, that was constantly mentioning Seneca, and Stoicism but in a very subtle way: Nicholas Nassim Taleb. So I wanted to learn about that topic from my own initiative, without any philosophical or theological background I had at that moment.\n\nUntil today, I’ve been learning through Stoicism passages for about a year (1T 2015 approx.). Since all the references where related to Seneca, I started by reading some letters from him (about Anger, Tranquility of Mind …) and after that I switched to Marcus Aurelius, Meditations. \n\nBut I found reading in Spanish was really difficult to digest (mainly because most of the text tend to be translated in ancient Spanish, compared to English texts that are way more understandable). Finally I found the easiest comprehensive lessons to myself, through Epictetus discourses and The Enchiridion. But now I feel that I should keep re-reading because such wide variety of concepts should be properly internalized: Now I’m reading the Spanish translation of the first volume of the Stoicorum Veterum Fragmenta about Zeno and his disciples.\n\nAs I mentioned in the beginning, I’ve been out of theologies for most time in my life (despite I’ve partially read some religious and eastern philosophies texts like The Bible or the Tao te Ching for some awareness) and also philosophies (despite that my sister is Graduated and high-school teacher in Philosophy Studies!). What I have a more deeply comprehensive knowledge is about psychological therapies, mainly Cognitive Behavioral Therapies, and Mindfulness-based Behavioral Therapies.\n\nIn my early 20s I always thought that some disciplines like ancient Buddhism from what I read could be integrating ideas to manage my situation. But as most of the people fall: I found that what I could just perceive were that aphorisms that fell nowhere. Those aphorisms that I currently and constantly read from Stoicism, and bring a lot of people to the philosophy, but I found they doesn’t mean anything isolated without action after: I could not figure out what was really important at that moment. Because I could not give enough relevance to the Behavioral part of the life. Could not understand how the actions and decisions align our fate. Don’t ask me why, but I was fully convinced in the past, that our thoughts and our way of thinking was clearly the only path to acquire some Virtue.\n\nBut how I could be virtuous If after my thought I could not take the decision to act? In my thought just were aphorisms in my mind and a massive self-help booklet in constant playback in my mind?\n\nI decided to start my path in Stoicism practice from late 2016, so I can’t currently acknowledge If I’m really an Stoic because I’m executing some Stoicism practices every day to progress and understand everything related.\nI would like to progress further in Virtue and I find useful especially for working out social bonds related to Stoicism taking part of this course (especially considering that nowadays is not easy to find Stoicism disciples around and I find this a great opportunity).\n\nThere is plenty journey to continue along Stoicism, and currently I have the impression that for every text I read it seems to unfold other3 texts waiting to be read. From time to time I feel this will start to flourish, but now as I mentioned, I’m just taking Stoicism practice in my life\n\nFrom taking my morning “ritual”, with some Stoic Meditation, plus View from Above and Hieracles Cosmic Perspective meditations, with further daily reading and stoic reminders, and obviously as I mentioned before, Negative Visualizations and also Mindfulness Meditations. I like participating in some Stoic forums from time to time and finally I found that in the actual practice of voluntary renunciation was something I was working out through some therapy advises that helped my overcome the disorder some years ago.\n\nAlso I believe but have not proved yet, that introducing Stoicism to some OCD individuals as a complement to psychological therapy, can be the puzzle piece that CBT and MBT sometimes miss.', 1, '', 0, 0, 0, '', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', 1, 0, '', '');

I have always been extremely interested in philosophy and mysticism.  As a child and young adult, I grew up in a non-practicing Christian household.  I have read many books on the real life of Jesus by historical scholars.  Then, I branched out into learning about Eastern philosophy and religions as well as ancient philosophies.  After the birth of my first child in 2008, I became fascinated by philosophy, particularly Kierkegaard and Marcus Aurelius.  Over the last 2 years, I have felt Stoicism become a way of life for me and I can’t read enough or learn enough about it.  I would love to enhance my understanding of Stoicism through the College of Stoic Philosophers as well as teach Stoic philosophy as part of my future career.\n	My name is Chris LeCron.  I was born in Annapolis, MD in 1975.  Both of my parents are high school teachers, now retired.  My brother was valedictorian of his high school class and now is a practicing patent lawyer in D.C.  I grew up with a love of learning and sports and activities.  I did a ton of reading on all subjects and actively played soccer, basketball, baseball, and track.  I felt a calling to the military life and applied to both the Naval Academy and ROTC programs.  I was accepted into the Naval Academy but decided I wanted to have the full college experience.  I ended up going to Western Maryland College since it was the only ROTC program that was willing to let me play varsity soccer and complete ROTC.  It was an Army ROTC program.\n	I have always been a natural leader and enjoy getting along with people of all types and backgrounds.  I also enjoy being resilient and showing resilient leadership.  The stoic practice of only concerning oneself with events we can control is a powerful leadership philosophy.  Welcoming all things in your life with a noble spirit is another beautiful life lesson and leadership lesson.  I have always thought about having gratitude for the things that I have such as my health, family, etc.  Practicing negative visualization has always been a way for me to get through troubled times and is an aspect of Stoicism that I really love.\n	After college, I have mostly spent my adult life on active duty in the Army.  There was a brief period of time from 2003 to 2006 where I went into the Army reserve and completed law school at the University of Baltimore.  My plan was to go into the Army JAG Corps.  After completing law school, I really enjoyed the education but not the job so I continued in my Army career in other fields such as strategy, logistics, and human resources.  I am still in the Army reserve but have been on active duty continuously since 2006.  \n	I started going through a philosophical and spiritual awakening after the birth of my first child in 2008.  I met my wife Laura Adler at a bar in D.C. in 2004.  We hit it off right away.  She was enrolled in the Johns Hopkins nurse practitioner program at the time.  I was in law school.  We had a quasi-honeymoon during the summer of 2005 when she came with me during my semester abroad in Rome.  We got married in 2005 and had Ezra in 2008.  I deployed to Kuwait and Afghanistan during 2010 while Ezra was still only one and half years old.  I have been fortunate enough to be on active duty in the National Capital Region at the Pentagon since 2010.  We now reside at a home in Columbia, MD.\n	Along with Ezra (now 8), we have Judah who is 4 years old and Leo who is 2 years old.  My wife works as a nurse practitioner in Baltimore city at a federally subsidized public health clinic, a part of the Uniformed Health Service Corps.\n	I was promoted to Lieutenant Colonel in the Army in April of 2015 and hope to achieve the rank of Colonel prior to retiring.  I hope and plan to stay on active duty for another 3 to 5 years.  The birth of my boys, the nearing end of my military career, and turning 40 years old, has really took me deep inside myself to figure out my purpose on Earth.  I truly believe that the Stoic leaders found the true guide to the “good life” and that virtue is the way and purpose of all our lives.  If I can find a way to increase my knowledge of Stoicism and spread the Stoic word into modern society I would love to do that.\n	Stoic books and articles that I have read include the following; Marcus Aurelius “Meditations”, Epictetus “Enchiridion”, Podcasts “Daily Stoic”, Book “Obstacle is the Way”, and “A Guide to the Good Life”.\n	I do believe that there is an inherent spirituality and mysticism in Stoicism.  Most of the ancient Stoics believed that much of following Stoicism is following the will of God and nature.  I think that many people who only know of the word “stoic” miss the bigger concept of Stoicism as a philosophy of life and spiritual path.  It is not that emotions are bad, it is that when we change our perception, our emotions change.\n	Right now, I have quotes from Epictetus and Marcus Aurelius taped up at my work place and at my house.  Although my wife is Jewish, she is more culturally Jewish than faith based.  She is interested in Stoicism and things I have read and accepts me teaching the Stoic insights to our boys.\n	The quotes and teachings that have become daily mantras for me are mostly from Marcus Aurelius.  “Welcome all things in your life with a noble spirit” is such a profound way of perception.  So many times, I am labeling something as good or bad when it really just “is”.  Even if it is not what I had planned to happen or want to happen, how do I know that it is not the best thing to happen to me or others in my spiritual growth?\n	To only judge the actions of myself and not others is truly profound as well.  The ego is very good at making out others as enemies and wrong.  We must first work on ourselves and always work on ourselves.  If someone acts without virtue, it is only a mistake and an error of knowledge which all humans make.\n\n', 1, '', 0, 0, 0, '', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', 1, 0, '', ''),

My family was a ranching/farming family and I grew up being close to my Grandparents on both sides and all of my cousins and second cousins.\n\nI went to a small public school in Owyhee county and through slight effort was at the top of our class.  My family including my cousins also were at the top of their classes.  Our family in general valued education and none of us were very religious at all and in fact most of my family on all sides did not belong to any organized religion, which was slightly abnormal for the region.\n\nMuch of my teenage years was spent playing role-playing games with my friends.  We played Dungeons&Dragons, Middle Earth Role Playing game, Paranoia and Role-master.  The best hours of my teenage life was spent reading fantasy and playing RPGs.\n\nI went to the University of Idaho and the Chinese University of Hong Kong.  I also went to many countries in Asia.  I developed a fondness for Lao Tzu and Confucius during my stay in Hong Kong and also enjoyed reading and using the I Ching.  After graduation I worked as a heavy haul trucking dispatcher and then as a customer service representative in US West, a Baby Bell, where I joined the Communications Workers of America and became a strong union supporter, which I still am.  \n\nI got married to my wife who is from Japan and after two years living in America we moved back to Japan and have lived here since year 2000 in the city of Nagoya.  I am an English teacher here and for the last 13 years I have mostly taught preschool children English.  I still belong to a union called the General Union.  I have 3 children who are all dual citizens as of this moment.\n\nI have been interested in Stoicism since I had some personal crises from when I was around 33.   I saw that life had very little meaning the way I was going at it. So thanks to my crises I changed my life by reading, studying, meditation, and prayer. I am a Baha’i and have chosen that religion for myself after some study.  My children also read on their own and since we are in Japan they like Rongo which is sayings from the Anellects by Confucius.  I also like Confucius and his thinking and think it is very important.  They main thing is I feel as a parent I should lay the kit of spiritual/virtuous ideas out in front of my kids and let them chose whatever will help them the best.  \n\nPhilosophy has given me back my sanity and I am very thankful to many sources.  I especial like many Greek sources of philosophy and Existentialism.   I really like Stoicism and consider myself kid of a blended Stoic because I also use some things from Epicureanism and Pyrrhonism.  I also really value the ideas of Sartre, Camus, Heidegger, Nietzsche and Whitehead.  I have read many of their books and I feel many of the ideas of authentic life and bad faith are important to us in our modern world\n\nStoic books Read:\n\n\nElizabeth Carter,  All the works of Epictetus, which are now extant; consisting of his Discourses, preserved by Arrian, in four books, the Enchiridion, and fragments.

After I found the NewStoa website I downloaded all of the PDFs on that site and read them.  I have belonged to the NewStoa for awhile and because I want to help the Newstoa out in Asia I am applying for this course to go over my ideas with someone so I can best help out our group.  I feel the thoughts and procedures created by the Stoics and Epicureans can really help people.  \n\nAnother reason why I am applying for this course is I have never really discussed stoic ideas in a class type/learning setting.  I have talked about stoic ideas with my friends and family, but sometimes I feel I am too vague or may be I can not express my convictions in an easy to understand way.  That is why I want to study something more formal.  I want to try to host more stoic get togethers in Japan or at least have a better defined, logical and coherent presentation to people who are interested in stoicism.  Since I want to help the NewStoa I also feel that I should try out the programs before I recommend others to try them out.  Then I would have a better idea of what our group has to offer and the good and difficult points to the programs.  \n\nI am looking forward to this course and I am grateful to our group and many others that have started on the internet that allow people like me who are geographical distant from like minded people to feel camaraderie and fellowship in a way of living which I find extremely valuable and important.

I remember my childhood as a mostly happy time, playing with my friends in the woods, playing alone at home, reading and family time. Even when things were not always easy, as my father died when I was eight and my three younger siblings between one and five, but the love and care of my mother and grandmother made the best out of the situation. I was always relatively good at school, but not very excited about it and tried to get through it with the least amount of effort possible. We have a weird school system in Germany that puts children into one of three possible tracks by the age of ten. By that age I mostly cared about staying with my friends, so we decided to put me in the middle track, which prepares for a later vocational training, but does not end with a high school diploma, so going to college later is not possible. My mom always wanted us to be happy and always supported us with our education, but she did not necessarily push us to high achievements. So, with 16 I was done with that school and started a vocational training in electronics in a company that used their apprentices mostly as cheap labor and bored me to death for years. Luckily I picked up computer programming at this time and sometimes got to do that for a few weeks. They offered me a contract after the three and a half years of training, but I just wanted to get the hell out of there. At this time, we still had mandatory army service in Germany - so I got drafted, refused and started my civil service in a small institution of mentally ill people, which turned out an incredibly challenging and eye opening experience. After working there for a year I decided that I wanted to know more about the human mind, went back to a high school for adults and finished it when I was 24. After that I enrolled for a cognitive science degree and studied in a horribly boring German town, which had the only program of this kind. The program was amazing! We studied computers and artificial intelligence, biology, linguistics, mathematics, psychology and philosophy. This study program, and my girlfriend and that time who was in the same program focusing on philosophy of mind, profoundly changed the way I saw the world. Before that, I had accumulated a set of spiritual believes that were a mix of christianity, together with a more new age worldview and even reincarnation. I was convinced that there is meaning in the things happening and that _it all makes sense_. The first classes in epistemology, together with the science classes and the people around me, challenged those believes and I remember that it felt like I was loosing the ground under my feet for a while. But only for a while, as I realized that it is painful but powerful, to ask so many questions, to challenge assumptions and to try to get rid of all the unnecessary ones. In combination with a semester abroad in Jerusalem, where I studied neuroscience at the Hebrew University and experienced this conflict caused by religious extremists, I become an arrogant atheist that would have loved to tell every believer how irrational and stupid their believes are. Luckily that changed over the following years and nowadays I would describe myself as a tolerant agnostic with a scientific worldview. In 2009 and moved to Berlin to start a computational neuroscience grad school where I enjoyed the studies, but the city even more. Many of my old friends had moved there, I made new friends and it was the first time that I felt that I was in the right place at the right time. I love the raw energy of this city and it makes me feel alive to walk through its streets on a day in spring or a hot summer night. After the school I felt a bit fed up with the academic life, I did not feel like publishing like crazy and following the path to tenure, so I joined a friend of mine who worked for a startup that wanted to develop an adaptive learning platform. I always wanted to work in a job that has a positive influence on society, so I left the startup after two years when I realized they were more into selling the content, than educating people. Shortly before I quit I had found a newly found non-profit in San Fransisco that had the mission to use _software and data analysis for social impact_, which sounded perfect, California too, so I moved there about two and a half years ago. Last year we opened a new office in Paris and I moved back to Europe and last week I decided that not living in Berlin is stupid, so I quit the probably best job I\'ll ever have and will move to Berlin in the next few months. \n\nAdditionally to the above mentioned biographic events, I want to attempt to shortly describe my personality. I\'m a quite social person, but I often need my time alone and I tend to lose focus on the important things in life when I spend too much time in the community of my friends. This is why the last few years abroad were incredibly helpful on the path of getting to know myself better. I like challenging myself and I\'m most of the time hungry for new experiences. Of course not always, but I feel like I\'m wasting time when I\'m in one of my less energetic phases. I discovered stoicism over the last 6 months and I found its psychological tools helpful to stay focused on the important things in life and to live it to it\'s fullest. Before that I was drawn to the meditation practice of Buddhism, but it was often hard to implement it\'s abstract advice into my daily life, in contrary to the pragmatic guidance of stoicism. \n\nAfter stumbling upon stoicism on the internet in several blogs and podcasts, I recently read the book by William B. Irvine. It helped me to get a better insight into the philosophy and I became practicing and curious to learn more. I currently read Seneca, but have sometimes trouble understanding the text. From the SES I would hope to get help in reading the ancient texts, as well as practical advice of how to integrate the stoic teachings into my daily life.

Vienna, in conjunction with the neighboring towns, functions more as a small city on the outskirts of D.C., than a small country town.\n\nGrowing up there was a short list of items that took up a long duration of my time, and almost all were sports related. Swimming year round, playing AAU baseball year round, playing AAU basketball year round, with some other activities sprinkled in, constituted most of what I spent my time on through graduation from high school. Following graduation from high school, I continued my education in State College, Pennsylvania by attending Penn State University. The college experience entailed a lot of football games, swimming on the club team (in addition to being club President), and studying to gain my bachelor’s degree in accounting.\n\nNow, although the story from birth through graduating college was a great part of my life, I consider post-graduation to be where I really started to explore things and gain new insights to the world. Following graduation from college in May of 2012, I migrated across the country and moved to San Francisco in August of 2012. My career started at a public accounting firm and I tried to fully immerse myself into everything that this new west coast land had to offer. My sporting activities changed a bit and now consist of open water swimming (a couple “Escape from Alcatraz” swims under my belt), biking (some 25+ mile rides under my belt), and running races (some half marathons under my belt). I’ve met new friends, learned new activities, and most importantly explored new mentalities. This was what eventually led me down the path to discover Stoicism.\n\nThe first book I read that dealt with Stoicism directly was A Guide to the Good Life: the Ancient Art of Stoic Joy by William B. Irvine. My mind exploded. There were ideas in that book that were so simple, but resonated so strongly with me that I full immersed myself in learning more about Stoicism as fast as I could. That was around April 2015. Almost two years later the ideas still resonate just as strong, if not stronger, and many have been the foundation of how I’ve lived my life the past few years. I am not obtuse enough to say that I know and understand all things Stoicism, but I will venture to say that I have been exposed to a very wide range of Stoic ideas from a variety of sources.\n\nI’ve read Meditations, Enchiridion, Letters from a Stoic (in addition to other essays and letters by Seneca), and Pierre Hadot’s The Inner Citadel, however, I read all of them through a fairly simple lens. They were not read while trying to focus on specific themes or ideas, and I have never discussed the ideas in the texts with other people. This is one area that I really hope to expand upon through this course. I love reading about Stoic principles and ideals, however, the public discussion aspect that Stoicism was essentially founded on back at the Stoa Poikile has been absent from my learning process. The chance to openly discuss Stoic philosophy with others who are interested and engaged is something I really look forward to participating in.\n\nIn addition to overtly Stoic texts, I’ve also read many books that utilize and reference Stoic ideals, but aren’t technically preaching Stoic philosophy as a whole, like Ryan Holiday’s The Obstacle is the Way and Ego is the Enemy. There are also many sports psychology books that utilize key Stoic beliefs as a baseline for mental prep in relation to sports and teamwork. \n\nThrough the books, articles, and essays that I have come across about Stoicism, I have discovered other philosophies as well. I have researched and read up on the basic tenants of other philosophies, including Epicureanism, Platonism, Cynicism, and others, but none have grabbed me as strongly as Stoicism. These other philosophies do contain fascinating ideas and beliefs, but none have resonated as strongly as the principles laid out by Stoicism.\n\nMy personal “studies” of Stoicism has definitely made me scrutinize my past beliefs in all areas more closely, including within the religious realm. I was raised Catholic and still would say I am a Catholic today. However, I’ve come to appreciate the power that religion has to empower and motivate people more so than the specific tenants within the religion itself. I never have a problem discussing religious ideals and beliefs, but I firmly believe that you should scrutinize every belief you hold to see if you truly believe it, or you have just inherited the belief from someone else. I am firmly in that process right now.\n\nMy hope from this course is to progress from just reading Stoic ideas to more thoroughly analyzing them and using those to analyze my own beliefs more. This, coupled with the chance to openly discuss ideas with another person who is open to a lively discussion and to explore new ideas, would serve as the best possible combination to learn more about Stoicism going forward.\n\nSomewhat unrelated to Stoicism, but as a chance to share a bit more about myself, since moving to San Francisco, I have expanded within the artistic realm as much as I can. I love to create art… any kind of art. I have experimented and created art pieces using simple materials like pencil and markers, all the way to more bizarre mediums like spray paint and acrylics. I do firmly believe that the Stoic beliefs that I have adopted have influenced my artistic appetite greatly and I have no doubt learning more about Stoicism will contribute further to this art development.', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, '', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', 1, 0, '', ''),

I was born in the “Bible Belt” of the United States in 1960 to a family that subscribed to a fundamentalist Christian theology.   I was taught, that not only if you weren’t a Christian you were going to hell, but also that if you weren’t a member of “our” church you were going to Hell.   I never quite bought into that belief system… and in my teenage years… rejected Christianity…      What I didn’t do at that time was replace that system of beliefs with any other belief system that would have led to a more meaningful, purposeful life.\n\nMy first real exposure to alternate belief systems was an introduction to world religions class that I took during my first few college semesters.  At that time, my eyes were opened to Hinduism and Buddhism… though I did not explore them further until many more years had passed.   By my late 20s, I had dropped out of college, been married, had children, gotten divorced and was rapidly spiraling downward.   My “rock bottom” was hit at age 29 and that bottoming out finally initiated a search to “know myself.”\n\nIt was shortly after this that I began to practice Buddhist meditation or Zazen which led me eventually to spend almost 2 years as a resident student at a Zen monastery in the Catskill Mountains of NY.   Oddly enough, it was there that I realized I had thrown the Christian baby out with the bath water and that there were alternative visions to the Christianity I had grown up around.    \n\nUntil the last year…  and perhaps, even now… I would have described myself as a Buddhist… sometimes as a Buddhist/Christian as I had found a version of Christianity called “Process Theology/Philosophy” that wasn’t anathema.    Whether Buddhist or Christian, I was never able to find a sangha or church that I could feel comfortable in for long…    At some point, I would be disappointed or frustrated by the literalness or the ritual or a demand for blind faith…      So, I primarily practiced alone.\n\nLast year…  I came across Pyrrhonism because of a few books that connected Pyrrho to Buddhist beliefs, “Greek Buddha” being one of them.    While I had never heard of Pyrrho…   and had slight to no knowledge of Skeptic philosophy, it struck me that perhaps I hadn’t ever needed to go toward Eastern Philosophy to find a meaningful philosophy of life…       This was really the beginning of my interest in ancient philosophy, including Stoicism.  I now have the “Stoic 6 pack” books on my Kindle but have yet to read them.   I do have Sextus Empericus, “Outlines of Pyrrhonism” but it is a challenging read.   I do not have a deep understanding of Stoic Philosophy and that is part of the reason for registering for the SES course.\n\nThe reason I said earlier that it felt like this was a culmination of a path I have been traveling is that I experienced a sense of “homecoming” recently and an understanding of why my church/sangha shopping was never successful.    The notion of holding non-evident beliefs provisionally made sense of my past confusions…  and I understood that ultimately, I wasn’t meant to have “blind faith.”   That blind faith of any kind, made as little sense to me as fundamental Christianity did when a was a child.\n\nI don’t know that I have enough understanding or grasp on Stoic philosophy to consider myself a Stoic.  But I now, have a difficulty deciding whether to describe myself as “Buddhist” since I believe there is a “middle path” that doesn’t require the Buddhist belief system either…   \n\nMy interest in learning Stoic philosophy isn’t just personal, it’s also professional, though in general, I try to align my personal and professional values.    I am a psychotherapist, licensed as Marriage and Family Therapist.  Even in the path toward licensure and professional development in that field…  I have proceeded down a path that is leading me toward philosophy.      I am not a big fan or even supporter of the medical model of mental health and my professional journey has taken me down a path that is leading me toward more of philosophical counseling, philosophical practice or even Philosophical Midwifery mode of working with clients.    In July, I’ll travel to New York the American Philosophical Practitioner’s Association for a certification training in philosophical counseling.\n\nMuch of my reading lately has been books on philosophical practice and its differentiation with psychotherapy and I believe that eventually, I may be working completely from that model vs a medical model that views what is frequently the normal suffering of life (Dukkha in Buddhism) as pathological. I have a sense that in my personal life and in my professional work with clients… that philosophy, including Stoic philosophy can provide a grounding, a blue print for how to have a life well lived…\n\nI’m not much interested in philosophy as history…  but in the “so what” of it…    How does it help me live a better life… how does it help provide meaning, purpose, direction, etc.…?     and how would it help those I work with…?     That’s my interest in this course and what I hope to get out of it is that… along with a deeper understanding of what it means to be a Stoic and live a philosopher’s life.\n\nIf the College of Stoic Philosopher’s classes, including the School of Essential Studies that I have applied to can help me develop a deeper understanding of Stoic philosophy I would consider it time and energy well spent.   Even more so, if I find a “home” base, something of an endpoint for a search that has been 50+ years.    Ultimately, I am looking, using Buddhist terminology, to relieve “suffering” ala the Bodhisattva ideal…   My practice of psychotherapy affords me the opportunity to do this for others…and since I am not immune to suffering either…    I can’t say that there isn’t a selfish desire to relieve whatever suffering I may experience as well…\n\nThanks for considering my application.   I look forward to studying if accepted.\n\nBest wishes,\n\nLynndal\n', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, '', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', 1, 0, '', ''),

After moving to four different cities in 2 states, my family finally settled down in Graham, Texas in 1979 where I lived a blissfully average life for the remainder of my school years.  My Dad is a graduate of Midwestern State University with a degree in Geology; he has been in the oil business my whole life.  My mom was a stay at home mom for many years, only going into the workforce after I reached the fourth grade.  I have one sister who is two years younger than me.  She is now a high school teacher on the Texas Gulf Coast.  Growing up, I found school boring, but managed to keep my grades up enough to keep my parents happy.  I played little league baseball every year until I finally exceeded the age limit.  I wasn’t good enough to play for the high school team.  I played the tuba in the band throughout junior high and high school.  I was also in Boy Scouts for many years, however I was never motivated to make it beyond the rank of First Class.  My main pastime during my high school years consisted mainly of hanging out with friends, which usually meant cruising the main street of our small town of 9,000 people.  \n\nIn 1991 I graduated high school, and went to Texas Tech University in Lubbock.  I mainly chose the school because that’s where my closest friends were going.  I chose Mass Communications as my first major; I wanted to get into radio.  Over the next three years, I changed my major to Business, then Pre-Nursing, then back to Mass Communications.  In 1993, I began dating on of my closest friends from high school.  We moved in together the following year and were married in June of 1995.  I still hadn’t finished college, and was no longer interested in any of the majors I had tried up to that point.  I talked to an Air Force recruiter in August, and shipped out to basic training in November.  \n\nOur first assignment was to Lakenheath, England.  We spent three years travelling all over the UK and making excursions to France, Spain, Germany, Austria, and Italy.  It was a great time to be young, married, and childless.  As much as we enjoyed living overseas, we missed home and chose not to extend our tour there.  In 1999, the Air Force took us to Colorado Springs.  Shortly after arriving we began the process of adopting a child.  We had always wanted to have some children biologically and then adopt, but our attempts at having children naturally were not fruitful.  In June of 2001, we were placed in a foster-adopt situation with a wonderful18-month old boy.  In December, the adoption was finalized and the following March, my wife gave birth to our little girl.  Now, it was time to move again.\n\nIn October 2002, the Air Force moved us to Vandenberg AFB, California.  After a couple years there we were again facing infertility, so we started looking into adoption again.  In 2005 we were placed with a new born baby boy and his one year old sister.  We had a wonderfully full house, but it wasn’t fated to stay that way.  After a year of raising the two new additions, their mother completed all the wickets necessary to regain custody of her children.  It was a devastating blow, but we did everything we could to make the transition as easy as possible on the kids.  We visited them every couple of weeks for several months until it was time to move again.  \n\nAfter moving to Denver, Colorado in 2006, we completely lost touch with the foster kids.  The loss of these kids had a lasting impact on our family.  I don’t think my wife and son ever completely healed.  But we kept going, moving on with our lives.  In 2010 we were surprised to find ourselves pregnant again and our little boy joined us in December of that year.  Then, once again, it was time to move.\n        \nIn August 2011 we moved to Oahu, Hawaii.  This was the assignment I’d been dreaming of for the last 16 years.  It was for the most part everything I had hoped for.  We went to the beach all year round.  We went on so many hikes in the rain forests I’ve lost count.  My wife finally gave me permission to buy my first motorcycle.  It was truly paradise.  It had one major flaw though (besides the insane traffic).  The schools in Hawaii are some of the worst in the U.S.  My son entered middle school and quickly began his downward spiral of depression and anxiety kicked off by the unbelievable amount of bullying from both the other kids and some of the teachers.  This is when he began using alcohol and drugs, though we didn’t recognize it until much later.  After one semester in public school, we pulled him out and tried to homeschool him.  After two months of that, we realized it wasn’t working at all and my wife took him to Denver to finish the school year while they stayed with family.  They returned that summer and we enrolled him in a private Catholic school, though we are not Catholic.  We thought things were looking up, it then he went further down his spiral, doing more drugs and committing self harm until we finally had him admitted into a behavioral health facility.  After a few months he came home and went back to the Catholic school, only to relapse a few months later.  This time, after completing his treatment, the school wouldn’t take him back.  We tried homeschooling again because we were out of options.  We weren’t very diligent about it though because we’re just not cut out for it.  Thank goodness it was finally time to move again.\n\nMy Wife’s mom had been diagnosed with terminal cancer, and since the Air Force had a position for my career field in Omaha, Nebraska, I successfully lobbied to get moved there.  We bought a house in Fremont, which is 50 miles from where I work, but four blocks from my wife’s parents.  My son appeared to start out better, but quickly resumed his downhill slide.  After five months he was charged with several alcohol related charges and put on probation.  Then, after nine months of moving to Nebraska, my mother-in-law passed away.  A couple months after that my son ran away and went on a 4 day drug binge.  He was picked up and placed into a rehab program in Omaha.  After running way from rehab the second time, they wouldn’t take him back and now he’s in a slightly more secure rehab facility.  Which brings us to today.\n\nI discovered Stoicism about a year ago.  I was raised in a moderate Christian Household, and considered myself a Christian up until I was about 22 years old.  For a few years, I had no idea what I believed, but didn’t really care either.   It was in Colorado Springs I came across Neal Donald Walsh’s Conversations with God books and my search for a spiritual path began in earnest.  I found a book called The Science of Mind, and for a while I considered myself a Religious Scientist, even attending a couple of their churches.  Then I discovered Deism and I was enthralled.  One of the Deist bloggers I was following became a Universal Unitarian minister, so I decided to try that out for a while.  I attended the UU church in Denver for a couple years and even changed my official religious affiliation in my Air Force records.  \n\nAt some point I came across Sam Harris’s The End of Faith.  It really struck a chord with me and I began to follow the atheism blogs.   I delved really deep into the arguments concerning the existence of God.  I really needed to KNOW.  It seemed like too important of a question to accept any answer on faith.  I tried to maintain a balance in my readings, searching for the best material from Christian apologists and atheists alike.  Ultimately I found the apologists arguments to be ridiculously deficient.  The simplicity of the atheist’s arguments won out; there was just no evidence for a god.  At this point, I guess I’m mostly an agnostic.  Sometimes I lean towards deism, and sometimes I lean towards atheism.\n\nIt was an article by Massimo Pigliucci that first brought Stoicism into my field of view.  I had been following him for a while and had great respect for his writing.  This of course revealed to me the multitude of Modern Stoicism resources.  I’ve read Ryan Holiday’s The Obstacle is the Way as well as Ego is the Enemy.  I’ve read William Irvine’s A Guide to the Good Life.  I’m currently reading Donald Robertson’s Stoicism and the Art of Happiness.  I’ve perused Marcus’s Meditations, but not read it all the way through.  I delve into any decent blog I can find.  What I feel Modern Stoicism lacks is the “why” behind it all.  When I found the Traditional Stoicism site, I felt maybe it could answer that question.  I read the references at the Society of Epictetus page and found them to be very engaging, but I’m still on the fence with traditional Stoic physics.  At my current level of knowledge, it would still require a leap of faith to accept a providential Universe, and I’m not ready to do that.  That’s why I’m here.  I want to get a better understanding of all three Stoic areas.\nCurrently, I consider myself a follower of Stoic ethics..  Is that enough to call myself a Stoic?  I don’t know, that’s another question I’d like this course to help me with.  I think I agree with the modern Stoics that even if you don’t accept the physics, there is still plenty of benefit to gain from adopting the ethics.  Just not sure I’d still be able to use the label.\n\nI also hope to use Stoic principles in dealing with the turbulent time my family is currently going through.  So far I’ve been pretty disappointed in the lack of material specifically applying Stoicism to parenting.  I find it relatively easy to accept the fact that I can’t control most things, but the pressure to be a good father and raise happy, productive children often pushes me past my limits of stoical calm.  My wife is no help; her primary mode of operations is to act out of emotions.  She often seems proud of her eschewing rational behavior.  Before the kids reached their teenage years, it was no problem to navigate this sea unrestrained passions, but the last few years have been too stormy.  Stoicism has helped me at times, but it frustrates her to no end when I’m calm while she’s about to explode.\n\nAnyway, that’s me in a nutshell.  I look forward to plunging deeper into Stoicism and especially working with a Mentor to get some good feedback.

I had what might be considered an idyllic childhood growing up in the rural south west of England in a small village surrounded by fields and farmland. My family was, and still remains, very close, despite the divorce of my parents when I was 10 years old. I was raised in a relaxed Christian household, our family attended the local United Reformed Church, a very English kind of church featuring plenty of tea and biscuits, beetle drives and a fun Sunday school which my two brothers and I attended most weeks up until my parents’ divorce.\n\nAfter the initial trauma of the divorce, which resulted in my Dad moving away and remarrying, our family redesigned itself, largely driven by my Mum’s search for a spiritual life with more connection and personal meaning. We started attending Quaker meeting, and found a real feeling of having come home. The Quakers are remarkable people who really live their faith in the real world and are not dogmatic, and I still consider myself an honorary Quaker to this day.\n\nAround this time my Mum and I were also starting to be heavily influenced by new age religion. The area of the West country around Glastonbury, where we lived, is well known for its thriving alternative scene. There are Goddess Temples, hippies and healing to be found everywhere, and we threw ourselves in to it. As a young teenager, I think I liked the feeling that I was connected to something, to the earth and to other people, in a really magical way. The belief in ‘energy’ and that I could change the world with my thoughts helped to negate a real feeling of helplessness at the evils of the world. Without the genuine belief that I could literally change the world on my own, I think I would have been much less active in the social justice sphere, but the feeling of power helped me to throw all my energy in to making the world a better and kinder place. \n\nI left home to go to university in 2002, still very much involved in the alternative scene. I experimented and partied, whilst earning a degree in Stage Management, and left in 2005 to work as a freelance stage manager. Throughout university I had been sporadically attending Quaker Meeting, as well as trying out many other types of new age religion, picking and choosing what seemed fun.\n\nIn 2006 I read Richard Dawkins’ book ‘The God Delusion’ and my whole life changed. I’m not sure if I had been thinking about atheism, I can’t recall what led me to read the book in the first place. My older brother has always been an extremely rational, analytical person (despite being a musician by trade), and became an atheist at a young age, so perhaps it was his influence, I can’t say. The arguments in the book were very compelling, but I remember the exact words that made me an atheist, and that was the part where Dawkins encourages the reader to ‘try on the glasses of atheism’, to just have a go at imagining what it would be like if there was no god. I suddenly realised that I had simply just been making things up. All my life I had been imagining magic there was no evidence for. I hadn’t even really been fooling myself, I knew homeopathy and reiki had never really worked on me, I knew I had never really seen an aura, I had just been playing a fun game that had become too serious to let go of.\n\nI then spent more than a year going through a kind of grieving process. I was angry that people I trusted had lied to me, I felt stupid, I felt that I had made a fool of myself in front of sensible rational people who had probably just humoured me. I felt disgust towards people who still believed in what I now felt was nonsense, and for a period I became an extremely militant atheist, arguing with my family and strangers on the internet, throwing my weight around and generally being an extremely unpleasant person whenever religion was mentioned. Sadly, this affected my relationship with my Dad and his new family somewhat, since his second wife was Catholic and he had converted in order to marry her. It was a very confusing and depressing time for me. I came to believe that objective truth was the most important thing in the world, and that everyone must see it or they were living a pointless life, no matter how much good they did or how happy they were.\nAs I grew in to an adult I simply grew out of this point of view. As I became more secure in myself, and got over the initial rush of seeing my beliefs clearly, I learned to live and let live. It took me a long time to trust meditation and self-help as useful concepts since they reminded me so strongly of my youthful beliefs, but I am much better now at incorporating the useful and rejecting the fanciful. I even took part in some Buddhist chanting recently whilst attempting to gracefully sidestep the invitations towards more a supernatural based practice. Ten years this would have likely ended in me starting an argument or sulking.\n\nIn 20013 my older brother bought me a copy of ‘Meditations’ by Marcus Aurelius, only telling me ‘he was a stoic’. I had never heard of the stoics before, and had never read any philosophy at all, and, finding the book slightly incomprehensible, read a few pages and then put it on the shelf to gather dust. In 2014 he sent me a link about Stoic Week, simply saying it ‘seemed good’. I quickly became absorbed in the Stoicism Today blog and decided to have a proper go at stoic week, deciding I would be a fool to turn away from the promise of 14% more joy! At the time, I was working as Company Stage Manager for a pantomime, a job with extremely long hours, stressful, but rewarding. I told my whole team that I was doing Stoic Week and they all helped me by yelling STOIC! at me whenever they could see me becoming stressed. Because I was so busy I didn’t follow the instructions to the full, but I did gain some insight in to some of the basic concepts, most of all the dichotomy of control, and put them in to practice. I was delighted with the results, and continued to concentrate on the practice of noting whether things were in my control or not for the rest of the year.\n\nBy the time stoic week 2015 came around I had been practicing that one technique extensively and found it really useful. I had failed to read any of the Meditations, however, and had somehow managed to make the assumption that Stoic philosophy was the dichotomy of control, and that I had essentially learned how to ‘do’ stoicism (although not yet mastered it!). I started Stoic Week that year, but became frustrated with seemingly the same exercises as before and gave up half way through. \n\n2016 saw the publication of Derren Brown’s book ‘Happy’. My brother and I are both huge Derren Brown fans, and when I heard he had written a book on Stoicism I got both of us a copy and started reading it in January of this year, and started to realise that there is a whole lot more that I had been missing. I haven’t yet finished that book, but in the mean time I have read William Irvine’s book ‘A Guide to the Good Life’. This is what really kick started me in to trying to live the whole of the Stoic philosophy (at least the ethics, I am modifying slightly since being an Atheist involves some mental adjustment of the advice), which I have now been doing for about three weeks. I have been listening to podcasts and joining online discussions and have set myself a reading list, however despite the continued assurances from experts that the original stoics are very accessible and easy to understand, I find them quite difficult. I have been working my way through the Meditations, but I find I understand a lot more clearly when modern writers explain the concepts to me. I can understand the quotes in the context of Derren Brown or William Irvine’s explanations, but taken on their own I find them much more difficult to analyse. \n\nThis leads me to the reason I want to take this course. I now consider myself to be a practising stoic, in the sense that I am reading and doing exercises every day. In some ways I am a natural Stoic. I am an introvert, and I have always had some awareness of the importance of disregarding things that don’t matter (as a teenager I used to repeat ‘big picture, big picture’ to myself if I was late and people were going to be angry with me)! My Mum always encouraged us to reflect on ourselves in a critical but positive way, and my many hours spent in silence in beautiful Quaker meeting houses, and the Quaker enthusiasm and joy at trying to better society with no-strings-attached help have given me much time for reflection on what is important in life. I know there is so much to learn about the history and writing of the Stoics, and the taste of practical benefit I have already had is tantalising, but I need a guide to help me through, to point out what I have missed, and help me to understand the writings.\n', 1, '', 0, 0, 0, '', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 'After her third week of Prosoche and numerous attempts to get her on track it was clear she no longer wanted to continue.

I now have the time, but I want to start over from the beginning to be thorough.', 'Brief Biography\n\nI was born in Montana but my earliest memories are of Nairobi, Kenya, where my father worked as an associate Peace Corps country director for several years.  After returning to the US at 6 years of age, I spent the remainder of my childhood in Montana, California, and Colorado. As an adult I have lived mostly in Colorado, but have also lived in Maryland, Germany, and Thailand. I have also spent three months in Cambodia, six months in Afghanistan, and twelve months in Iraq.These experiences have had a profound impact on my life, especially in recognizing how lucky I am to be an American citizen.\n\nI attended the University of Maryland and Colorado State University where I earned my Bachelors and Masters degrees in business administration, with a minor in political science.\nIn January of 2014 I finished my third and final deployment with the United States Army.  My first two deployments were in the infantry, my third was with an Army space support team. \nI’ve been married for two years and I work as a federal civil servant.\n\nInterest in Stoicism\n\nI have been interested in Stoicism for several years. Over the last 10 years or so I have been very interested in Buddhist thought and practice, particularly that of Zen Buddhism. Some time later, I received Marcus Aurelius’ Meditations as a gift.  Naturally, it struck me that there are some remarkable similarities between Buddhist and Stoic thought. Their differences are also rather interesting in that they are very complementary, in that the focus of Buddhism is on the control of desire while that of Stoicism is control of destructive emotion.  Though I realize that these differences are somewhat academic, I am still left with the impression that an understanding of both and the history of their influence upon one another can strengthen the thought and practice of each. \nUntil recently, I had assumed that these philosophies developed completely independently of one another. My studies, albeit very limited, of Afghanistan preparatory to my current deployment there with the US Army made me aware of the fact that the Buddhist and Hellenistic worlds in fact had extensive contact with each other. At first, I assumed this contact was rather superficial and casual due to contact along trade routes, but I eventually learned that Greek-speaking Buddhist communities and even kingdoms existed in what is now Afghanistan and that the two philosophies profoundly influenced one another. Fascinating!\n\nOn a more personal level, I have known many people who suffered from extremely destructive emotions, including myself. I have witnessed tremendous suffering and heartache that was avoidable. This was present in my family environment as a child and caused myself and my siblings to have psychological difficulties such as drug use and getting into unhealthy relationships.\n\nAs an adult I experienced combat in Iraq as an infantry sergeant. Due to these experiences, I was at one time prone to fits of rage, profound sadness, guilt, and other emotions which are collectively referred to as post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Though I never crossed the line into violence, I know that this - and suicide - are very common among combat veterans.  \n\nIn short, by adopting the principles of Stoic thought and action I believe I can contribute positively towards helping others to avoid unnecessary suffering whether it be caused by abusive family environments, combat experiences, or other factors.\n\nLastly, the extremes of emotions that we have witnessed on all sides during the last US Presidential election has highlighted the need for better self-control among the American people. We have become extremely polarized and intolerant of each other, which enables unscrupulous politicians to manipulate us instead of representing us.\n\nKnowledge of Stoicism\n\nAs yet, I have not studied Stoicism in depth, but I am aware of its basic concepts and looking forward to learning more. I benefit from a structured approach to learning, one where I have mentors and a community to guide me. I have purchased all the books that are recommended by the Stoic College for my course-work. I did begin this course previously, but had to discontinue due to time constraints. \n\nReligion\nI am an atheist and so tend to be skeptical of religion in general, but as long as it is practiced in good faith (pun intended) I can accept it. I have a very science-oriented mindset, which is part of my attraction to Zen Buddhism and Stoicism. As human beings quiet their desires and passions the natural result is a calmer and more rational approach to thinking and behaving. It is also the nature of both philosophies that they are fundamentally agnostic in the sense that they are universally verifiable and readily accepted and integrated by virtually any community regardless of its predominant or preexisting cultural attributes – a quality they have in common with science.\n\nI would not presume to call myself a Stoic at present, for the same reason that I would not call myself a Buddhist - I do not practice these principles (at least not very well) in my everyday life. However, I am determined to change that as I believe very sincerely and strongly in their principles. All of human virtue and progress depends on the ability of people to control their passions and desires. Much of human conflict, disease, environmental destruction, and other ills could be alleviated or prevented by the cultivation of a calmer and more rational system of thought and behavior.\n\nGoals for this Course\n\nI hope to gain a better understanding of Stoic thought both from an academic and personal perspective. As I mentioned, I learn best if I have a more structured approach that is guided and mentored than I do if I attempt to learn independently.  \n\nIn no particular order, I hope to gain an introductory understanding of the history of Stoicism, the perspectives, similarities, and differences of the major Stoic philosophers, how theory has been reflected in and differed from practice, and modern developments in Stoic thought and practice.\n', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, '', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', 1, 0, '', ''),

How does one really know himself?  I know that my name is Carl Conway White and that I was born on November 10, 1974, in Ventura, California to my father, Ricky, and my mother, Karen.  I know that my father’s side of the family are Presbyterians and of Scottish heritage and that my mother’s side of the family are Roman Catholics and of Irish heritage.  I know that I was raised in both protestant and catholic traditions and that belief in God was not only expected, it was drilled into me.  I know that after graduating high school I felt compelled to travel to Europe to escape a monotonous life and experience a world outside what I held to be a very narrow-minded bubble in which I felt contained and even restrained.  I know that while in Europe I spent a lot of time reflecting on my purpose in life; often questioning my own existence, which naturally led me to develop a deep interest in the study of philosophy.  I know that after returning home from a lengthy sejour abroad, I enlisted in the United States Air Force and ultimately became a police officer.    \n\nMy point in framing the introduction to this autobiography in such a way is to illustrate that when we speak of self-knowledge, we’re alluding to emotional or psychological knowledge.  I recognize my exterior and know my own refection, but I am not my physical characteristics.  Knowing yourself has been framed quite literally as “the meaning of life” because self-knowledge offers us a path to greater happiness and fulfillment.  Whereas a lack of self-knowledge exposes us to grief and mistaken ambitions.  Self-knowledge prepares us to avoid venturing down the wrong path and helps us better handle obstacles and adversity, which we will certainly face throughout our lives.  \n\nMy reflective and contemplative nature motivated me to pursue studies at the academic level.  As such, I began my undergraduate studies in 1999 at the University of Maryland Adelphi where I studied communication and rhetorical studies and developed an interest in language and human behavior.  After obtaining a Bachelor of Arts degree, I later pursued graduate studies in rhetorical studies at California State University Northridge where I was introduced to classical, modern and post-modern rhetorical theory, with more emphasis being on the latter and particularly the works of Michel Foucault and Jean Baudrillard.  Although exploring rhetorical studies offered me some level of intellectual stimulation, I did not truly connect with the works with which I was presented.          \n\nFast forward several years, and I found myself as a 41 year-old man who was not content; a man who angered easily; a man who succumbed to envy; a man who always wanted more, thinking that acquiring more material things would somehow bring me joy and happiness and solve all my problems and internal struggles; a man who was selfish; a man who wanted to be in control of outcomes; a man who lacked patience; a man who suffered from anxiety as a result of expecting and demanding instant gratification; a man who allowed external things to negatively impact my emotions and intellect. This was the man I had become and I was not satisfied!  \n\nShortly after this epiphany, give or take several months, I was perusing the philosophy section at my local bookstore when I stumbled upon Meditations by Marcus Aurelius.  I removed this book from its place and took it over to the bookstore café and began reading it.  This moment served as my official introduction to Stoicism.  Meditations was just what I needed in this time of self-crisis and it quickly became my own personal self-help manual that would motivate me to strive to be a better man and human being – the solution being entirely within myself.  \n\nMy thirst for more knowledge in the realm of Stoicism could not be quenched.  And although I know I had been introduced to some element of Stoicism during my academic studies, my path to Stoicism has indeed been circuitous because this philosophy had only registered a short while ago – at a time in my life when I needed it the most.  But, I think that is exactly how Stoicism ends up occupying a place in one’s life - when one is troubled and struggling internally and seeking an escape and ultimately a solution; that solution being self-transformation and self-mastery.  I have since read A Guide to the Good Life: The Ancient Art of Stoic Joy by William B. Irvine, which serves as a wonderful introduction to the basic ideas of Stoicism and how to apply the principles to one’s daily life; Epictetus’ The Art of Living: The Classical Manual on Virtue, Happiness and Effectiveness by Sharon Lebell; Enchiridion of Epictetus and I’m currently reading Stoic Serenity: A Practical Course on Finding Inner Peace by Keith Seddon.\n\nCertainly, my religious background and upbringing did not provide the answers to life that I was seeking.  As previously mentioned, I was born into a religious family with one side being protestant and the other catholic.  For many years I accepted that God exists.  As I have evolved in life, however, I have certainly questioned the existence (doubt) of a Creator, but I also recognized that science cannot explain the origins of the universe, which, in my humble opinion, makes the existence of a Creator quite plausible.  So, yes, I do believe in the existence of a Creator, but at the same time I acknowledge the basis of this proposition to be inherently unknowable.  Belief in a Creator (God) is just that – belief, and is entirely faith based.  One believes God to exist and reign over humankind, but this cannot be proven or known.  As such, I feel this position does not reduce me to strictly an agnostic, but more along the lines of an agnostic theist. \n\nDo I consider myself to be a Stoic?  I am in pursuit of becoming one.  I don’t feel I can identify myself as a Stoic until I have developed some level of mastery in applying the principles of Stoicism to my everyday life over a period of time.  The practice of Stoicism, on the surface, may seem quite simple for some, until we face adversity or encounter an obstacle and react and respond the way we did previously, which will likely be counter to what Stoicism teaches.   Stoicism is appealing – it’s a beautiful philosophy that is accessible to all unlike other philosophies that are so abstract and out of reach.  Stoicism is challenging because it requires inward reflection and acknowledging that you are actually the source of the problems at hand.  I certainly acknowledge that things beyond my control neither help nor harm my ability to flourish and live a good life.  I acknowledge that the only things that are truly under my control in life are my judgments and acts of will.  I acknowledge that peace of mind comes from abandoning fears and desires about things outside my control.  And I acknowledge the fundamental goal of human nature is to live a good life in cooperation with others.  It’s the daily application of these principles that makes one a Stoic and not just believing these principles to be true.  \n\nI have chosen to embrace and pursue Stoicism as a way of life - it’s the philosophy that speaks to me; the philosophy that resonates with me.  It’s unlike any other philosophy.  As the Ancient Stoics had guidance in their studies and pursuit of the good life, so do I seek guidance and I feel being accepted to this program, with the ultimate goal of being accepted to the Marcus Aurelius School, will provide a solid foundation upon which to grow and become a Stoic in thought and action.  \n\nSincerely,\n\nCarl Conway White      \n', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, '', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', 1, 0, '', ''),

This camp was part of a fundamentalist religious organization that was itself an offshoot of Mormonism. This group believed (still believes) themselves to be the Kingdom of God. They were the chosen people destined to fulfill Gods purpose for the earth in its final days. The only people who really mattered. Everyone else was “Outsiders”.\n\nI grew up in this camp. It was a boy’s paradise, with mountains, caves, fishing, old abandoned mines, and countless other such diversions that boys find so compelling. The school bus hauled us kids twelve miles to the tiny town of Huntington, Utah. As children we were thoroughly indoctrinated in the various fundamentalist Mormon beliefs, although not polygamy, since that was a big secret. They taught us that later when we were deemed old enough.\n\nAlong with the boy’s paradise aspect, there was rather severe economic exploitation of members, starting quite young. I was sent away from home often to work at what they called “stewardships”. In return I gained lots of experience and skills from doing many different jobs. By the time I was seventeen I had worked at a department store, service station, laundromat, corner market, potato farm, dairy farm, bottling factory, mechanics garage, and coal mine, among other things.\n\nAt seventeen I was put underground mining coal. I worked there for many years. (Six years underground and about 1 year above ground running a cat.) I became rather adept as a continuous miner operator, and excelled at pulling pillars. Pulling pillars consists of carefully removing pillars of coal in such a way that controlled cave ins occur, after you get out of the way…exciting stuff!\n\nI believed whole heartedly in the “Kingdom of God” through childhood and most of adolescence. About the same time I reached adulthood my belief began to fall apart. I found that it couldn’t withstand rational scrutiny. At the time I was working in the mine. The loss of faith took some time and had many causes, but eventually culminated in my going into the mountains to fast and pray for a week. By this time my faith was basically gone. I didn’t expect that God would give me any answers, but I didn’t want to wonder if he would. I wanted to know. My attitude was basically: “God, if you want me to keep doing this crap you’ve got to give me some reason to believe.” Needless to say, there was no sign from God. I lost my faith, and with it my God, my prophet, my family; my entire reality. I set off on my own with one of the leaders daughters, causing a great scandal.\n\nI had dropped out of tenth grade to work, but after I left the organization, I managed to get into college. I started out wanting to study philosophy. I had a naive notion about what studying philosophy at a University would be like. I thought they would have zeroed in on the truth and I could figure out the meaning of life this way. I guess I expected it to be somewhat like what it must have been like studying philosophy in ancient Greece.\n\nIn any case, it wasn’t what I expected, and I lost interest in studying philosophy at a University. After a few false starts I eventually got a degree in Electrical Engineering from the University of Utah. I graduated in 1992. I now work as a Process Control Engineer in a steel mill in Portland Oregon.\n\nMy now ex-wife and I raised two daughters, both of whom are now in college. My wife recently divorced me. She professed to recover memories of horrible abuse back in the 1990’s when the hysteria about this stuff was going on. As well as sexual abuse her memories included horrific ritual abuse including torture and murder, among other things. I believed her about this for many years, and it’s a long ugly story. Let’s just say that eventually my doubts grew. It caused a rift between us. I’ve only recently began to appreciate, through reading many books on the subject, how these kinds of memories can be constructed, even though they’re false.\n\nMy first exposure to Stoicism was from Marcus Aurelius. I had a collection of books called the Harvard Classics and it contained the Meditations. I read these from time to time and found that the content really resonated with me. Unfortunately, for many years, I didn’t study Stoicism more than just reading the Meditations from time to time.\n\nAbout two years ago I became much more interested in Stoicism, perhaps prompted by the dissolution of my marriage. I’ve since began reading a lot more and trying to practice the principles.   \n\nBooks I\'ve read on Stoicism include: The Meditations, A Guide to The Good Life by William Irvine, Stoicism and the Art of Happiness by Donald Robertson, Stoicism Today Selected Writings 1, The Enchiridion, some of Seneca\'s letters, and other books.\n\nI don\'t really think of myself as an atheist, though it seems obvious to me that the biblical God is a creation of man. I have an intuitive sense that there is some meaning behind the whole thing, but this meaning seems difficult to discern. I have more questions than answers. I have a suspicion of anyone who professes to have the answers, since I’ve seen so many frauds. I am a member of the Unitarian Universalist church, though I rarely attend services.\n\nI have studied other religions and philosophies including Buddhism, Hinduism, Islam, Christianity, Mormonism, etc.\n\nI consider myself an aspiring Stoic. Many of the principles resonate with me, bringing peace of mind, and brightening my mood. I\'m a long way from where I\'d like to be with it. I like the no nonsense, no excuses, take responsibility yourself, aspect of it. In contrast to the unrealistic, or self serving, kinds of nonsense you see in the self help culture, or in the various religions that profess themselves as the one true church; claiming essentially to own the toll road into heaven… Pay the toll and in you go.\n\nWhat I\'d like to get from the course is a deeper understanding of Stoicism as well as perhaps relationships with like minded people.', 1, '', 0, 0, 0, '', 0, '', 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 'I was born and raised in Utah.

I have a beautiful wife and we’ve been married just shy of 10 months with no intentions of having kids anytime soon. As a little background of myself, my family had overcome multiple obstacles over the course of our lives. Leaving our homeland and security for a new country while ours was being torn apart by war. We started from nothing in a foreign land and rebuilt. From there, we were forced to leave again, this time, we headed to the US. Same situation as before, we started from nothing. We had little money and packed only the things we could carry in 2 suitcases. When we first nested in our 2-bedroom apartment, we pulled furniture out of dumpsters to use until my dad could pull in a steady source of income. He did so by doubling down on himself and starting a freight transportation business. He knew as an immigrant with poor English and being a college dropout himself, he knew he couldn’t rely on the work he was “qualified” for on paper to provide for a growing family in a new land. As things start to pick up and rebuild, my father passed away when I was 9 years old. Something that still traumatizes me to this day. I was bullied by kids for not having a dad, which lead me to having a lack of social skills, which lead to me getting bullied more for being socially awkward and “weird’ throughout grade-school.  However, I learned early on that I had a choice on how I could feel. That I could be in the world, but not of the world. I also learned that my weaknesses, weren’t genetic, they simply needed the refiners fire. From there, I have been on a quest to find out who I am, how I can be the best man that I can be, but also weather the inevitable storms of life. This mentality has helped project me into the direction I’m heading in life and being able to make tough decisions will little to no stress. It’s been an awakening in my eyes. I dropped out of college at the age of 18, to drop back in at 19, to leave again at 19 and then make one last run of dropping in and out at age 22. I’ve never been one who exceeded in college courses or seen the value of it. I’ve always relied on my ability to network with people to create opportunities for myself. That’s what’s helped project me into the career path I’ve carved out for myself without meeting the minimum requirements of a college degree and now being the youngest team member amongst my peers leading the way to new systems and business strategy. I’m an avid reader and would much rather follow my curiosity to learn new things rather than be forced to take courses on things I don’t necessarily see the value in. I enjoy the outdoors and used to play basketball competitively and had a scholarship to play college ball until injuries prevented me from going, which is another obstacle that became the way for me to improve and grow. I learned how to accept the outcome for what it was and focused on what I had control over and what I could do next, regardless of external expectation or validation. I’ve been interested in Stoicism for about the last year or two. In a sense, I have been practicing stoicism for a long time, but didn’t know there was a correct term for it. I initially read Ryan Holiday’s post on Tim Ferriss’ blog, which lead me to picking up copies of meditations, letters from a stoic, Socrates and tools of titans (not necessarily a stoicism book, but has reminders). As of right now, I would call myself agnostic. I was raised Catholic (only went to mass Christmas & Easter), converted to Mormonism (about 2 years), and uncovered some dark truths about the Mormon church and learned more about human evolution and behavioral psychology which lead to my falling out from any organized religion. I’m stil not entirely sure whether there’s something after this life, or, if it’s like a power switch, flip it and it’s off. It’s a scary thought, but when the time comes, if that’s the case, we’ll have no subjective opinion on the matter. I have not studied any other philosophies other than Stoicism, but would love to learn more about all. There’s no better way to strengthen your argument of one with the knowledge of the latter. The more you learn, the more you realize you don’t know. If you’re like me, that’s exciting and continues to push me in new directions and new fields. I consider myself to be a practicing Stoic that constantly needs refinement. By no means am I perfect, and none of us are. We constantly need to be worked on and straightened out as we handle the burdens life has in store for us. From this course, ideally, I would love to get a more in depth understanding of Stoicism learn from the masters, set up a solid foundation for myself and expand upon that into deeper and deeper understanding of its principles. I want to set up Stoicism to be my guiding beacon in all things that I pursue in life, or end up happening to me as events do in life. This, I believe, will help me continue to build on top of what my father had started, to take care of my mom and new growing family, to help lead them through adversity, but also be an example to them that although it may appear everything is falling apart, you can still look internally to find peace and a sense of direction and are in complete control of your emotions and what you do next as a result.', 1, '', 0, 0, 0, '', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', 1, 0, '', ''),

I was born in Barrie, Ontario, Canada, in April of 1972, to a father who was Barrie\'s first surgeon, and a mother who managed to find herself a doctor to marry soon after immigrating from England.\n\nMy parents were not exactly academically oriented, or at all inclined towards religion.  So they were a bit uncertain about having a daughter who spent all her allowance on books rather than clothes or make-up, and who seemed to have a preponderance of books on philosophy, religion, and fantasy novels.\n\nI remember my father once asking me what I would do if he gave me a raise in my allowance: “You wouldn\'t just spend it on more books, would you??”.  Knowing his mind, I said, “No!  If I had more money then I could spend it on pretty clothes!”  He approved, and gave me the raise..  I bought one top, on sale, and then went right back to the bookstores.\n\nI always did well in school.  When time came for University, Dad was ever pushing me to take a business degree, which was utterly abhorrent to me.  I wanted to study philosophy and mythology and religion and English Lit!!  I had a very naive lack of concern about being able to make money after university.  My teachers had always told me I was brilliant and that I could do anything I set my mind to, so I chose to believe that I would be highly employable regardless of what I took in school, and regardless of my father\'s concern.\n\nIn the end, my father and I agreed to my taking a science degree in Botany and Zoology, since the environmental movement was taking off in the early \'90\'s.  But I managed to take the maximum amount of elective courses in the arts and humanities, and took an extra senior year in Philosophy.  Daddy wouldn\'t pay for that year, of course, but I had to do it.\n\nLife was tough for a lot of years after that.  I jumped around between more wretched low-paying jobs than I can count.  Being an excellent student had zero value in the “real world”, I soon learned; especially for a shy introvert who bored of her jobs far too quickly.\n\nWhy did I not stay in academia?  That final year in Philosophy had been a saddening one for me.  I had always believed that Philosophy was all about finding out how one should live, and why.  So in class, I was ever keen to discuss which of the philosophers we studied had the better argument on the topic.  But anytime I made a point or asked a question along these lines, I was always shut down.  \n\nIt was made clear to me that that sort of thing was not why we were there, or why we studied philosophy; but rather, that we were just to examine what the various famous philosophers wrote, and be able to explain it.  It was not the case that any idea or system of thought was really better than another.  \n\nThis was absolutely baffling to me.  It quickly destroyed my dreams of becoming any sort of professor.  It was only much later in life that I found my sentiment regarding academic philosophy expressed in writing by another: Pierre Hadot.  He wrote of how philosophical speculation had become purely abstract and theoretical, and that this exegetical approach was set apart from the spiritual practice that philosophy had once been.  So I was not entirely alone in my disappointment.\n\nI see hints that this approach has changed somewhat in academic circles today, as there seem to be many professors publishing books, essays or blogs on practical philosophy.  Alas, it comes a little late for me!\n\nSome of the more interesting-sounding jobs that I had over the years, during and after University, included:\n\nPark Naturalist for the Ministry of Natural Resources\nResearch Botanist for the Royal Ontario Museum\nCD ROM Programmer for Sierra Communications\nArt Director for Cogniant Inc. (Wall St., NYC)\nLandscape Gardener for a billionaires\' 300 acre estate\nLandscape Designer\nRV Technician\nGolf Course Small Engine Mechanic\nHeavy Equipment Operator\n\nI actually stayed at the gardener position the longest, for 5 years.  It came with a beautiful log cabin in the woods, and I was able to work alone, listening to lectures, books, and podcasts all day on my ipod.  I found this of particular value when I became catechumen in the Eastern Orthodox Church. \n \nI had been a “seeker” all my life, flitting from one faith to another.  But when I first stumbled upon the Philokalia, a central text of the Orthodox faith – WELL!  Now here was something I could really sink my teeth into.  There was mountains of literature that I had never encountered before in any bookstore, and the history of the Byzantine Church was truly powerful and extraordinary. \n\nThe faith consumed me for 8 years.  I was baptised after a year and a half, and became a member of the Antiochian Orthodox Church. I was a choir member and Parish Secretary for many of those years, and volunteered in every way.  I was hard-core when it came to fasting, prayer rules, tithing, and attending every service: at least 2, and sometimes 4 and 5 days a week.  I visited monasteries and talked to many remarkable priests and nuns.  However, what took the greatest amount of time was an “obedience” that was to become the hardest thing I had ever done in my life.  It is probably why my priest set me to do it.  He knew he had to keep me busy, and challenged...  He told me to learn to chant.\n\nByzantine Chant is an 8-tonal ancient system of music that requires the student to be able to sight-sing, solo, without music, any given paragraph of text, in any of the 8 tones, in front of a cathedral full of people.  (By comparison, Western music has only one tonal scale: the “Do Re Me...” that you learned as a child.)  \nI was not Greek or Lebanese, I had no talent for music or singing,  had never even heard of Byzantine Chant before entering the church, and I had terrible social anxiety.  Imagine the challenge this presented to me, and the amount of work it was to overcome all these things.\n\nAfter about 4 years, I could finally claim to be “useful” on the chanters stand.  I led services, and eventually began to teach Byzantine Chant to others.\n\nHowever, my love affair with the Church ended after 8 years.  \n\nThe volunteering and asceticism had taken its toll on me.  I found myself becoming ever more despondent over not finding myself any closer to God, despite all my efforts and all my faith.  The constant self-recrimination of repentance and confession were, frankly, destroying me;  and the self-loathing cultivated in Orthodox theology was sinking me ever deeper into yet another sin – despair.\n\nI had met a wonderful man who had gone so far as to convert to Orthodoxy in order to marry me, but when I moved to his hometown after the wedding, it meant moving away from my church.  There were Orthodox churches in my new town, but they were Greek, and did not allow a word of English in their services.  What\'s more, they did not permit women to chant, even though I had some experience chanting in Greek. \n\nAll these factors combined made it harder and harder for me to go to church.  However, the real turning point came in the form of a book, just as it had all begun. You could say, the beginning of the end for me was a few years ago, when I bought a book of Seneca\'s Epistles at, (ironically), a church book-sale.  \n\nReading Seneca blew me away.  I had read Marcus Aurelias and Epictetus as a teenager, but it was Seneca that really caught my attention.  It was the language I knew and loved from the Gospels - so many of the same parables and metaphors, and so much of the same philosophy that I had fallen in love with in Orthodoxy!  But it was not Christian.  \n\nThe profundities that I had believed were original to Jesus Christ - were not.  They were from pre-Christian Greco-Roman philosophy.  Only, Seneca was a better writer.  What I had believed to be Revelation, now seemed much more like an inevitable collision of Greco-Roman philosophy and Judaism.  It was clear as day.\n\nFrom there, I found other authors.  I read Epictetus and Marcus again, of course, with much better appreciation this time.  And these in addition:\n\nStoicism - Sellars\nPhilosophy as a Way of Life -  Hadot\nStoic Spiritual Exercises – Buzare\nThe Stoic\'s Bible – Lauren\n\nStill working on:\nThe Cynic Philosophers – Dobbin\nThe Cambridge Companion to the Stoics\nPhilosophy for Life and Other Dangerous Situations – Evans\nRoutledge Handbook of the Stoic Tradition – Sellars\n\nSo, long story short, I fell away from the Church.  The crazy thing is, I still believe in the miracles of Jesus Christ and his Saints.  But for some reason, miracles just don\'t impress me that much any more.  I\'m not sure why.     \nI still consider myself a theist, but I believe in a far less anthropomorphic God. \n\nI also consider myself to be an aspiring Stoic.  I find my greatest comfort, inspiration, and edification in reading Stoic literature, and although I greatly miss the “community” that no one does better than the Church (in my opinion), I do still find meaning and hope in Stoicism.\n\nI should mention that I recently left the working world to return to school.  I am studying IT Administration full-time at TriOS College.  It is a welcome relief to be back in an environment where I seem to excel and where each day, full of learning, feels meaningful and well-spent.  Perhaps when I have my Diploma in a year, I could get a job in the IT department at a college or university, so I could at least remain in the environment which I love. \n\nAs for taking the courses on offer by the College of Stoic Philosophers, it would not only be a means of solidifying my understanding and practice of the Stoic way of life, but may also be a way for me to connect with others who share my love of philosophy as a spiritual pursuit.  It is important to me, as it was to the early Stoics, or Hadot, that the divine should not be utterly cast out of philosophical endeavour.  I cannot separate the two, and then have either of them make any sense without the other.\n\nIt is difficult to write an autobiography in only a few pages, but it is my hope that, despite my very circuitous route to Stoicism, you will consider my application to your courses on offer.  I would sincerely welcome an opportunity to delve much deeper, now that I have made fast friends with Seneca et al..\n\nVALE,\n\nSusan Hill\n', 1, '', 0, 0, 0, '', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', 1, 0, '', '');

Then I completed a three-year education as an insurance salesman. \nThis was my introduction into self-help and success literature because as a salesman, you have to become better, better, better…work on your personality and so on.  After a while, I got a job offer as a coach for unemployed people. I coached them how to create applications, taught them to use Microsoft Word and showed them some basic time-management strategies. At this time I completed a course to get more knowledge in the field of personal coaching, so that I could help them even better.  \n \nI was always eager for knowledge and keen on improving my skills. \n  \nThat\'s how one of my favourite hobbies, software developing, became my profession. I\'m a totally self-taught developer. I got an job offer from a software company so I took the chance to make it my full-time job, which I\'m still enjoying. \n  \nI\'m also interested in astronomy, darts, music, and cycling. Recently I began hiking - and philosophy. I was always very interested in how the world works and how to live a good life – besides trying to live a good life. Because of that, I\'m reading a lot. My way through the issue of "understanding life" led me through the usual self-help jungle, to some esoteric and spiritual topics as well as Buddhist philosophy. \n  \nThen I was introduced, mostly by Tim Ferriss, to Senecas moral letters. This has been about a year and some months ago. Later last year, I read Marcus Aurelius\'s meditations - and this book excited me a lot. Since then, I highly recommend everyone I meet to read this book.  \nSo that\'s when I needed to know more about Marcus Aurelius and the philosophy behind it. \nAfter that I read "The Obstacle is the Way" from Ryan Holiday and "A guide to the Good Life" from William Irvine. Both books opened my eyes and mind that philosophy is the "science" that leads to a better life. Until then, I thought philosophy was thinking about hard topics in an ivory tower. \n \nI also read the following books:  \nStoicism and the Art of Happiness, Donald Robertson, English \nA guide to the Good Life, William Irvine, English \nObstacle is the Way, Ryan Holiday, English \nMeditations (Selbstbetrachtungen) in German \nEpictetus\' Handbook / Enchiridion, German \nSome Letters from Seneca, German \nMany chapters from the Discourses, German \nSenecas On Anger, in German \nI regularly read in the Daily Stoic, English \n \nI also read some philosophical books in the German language, i.e. a book about Stoic philosophy "Die Philosophie der Stoa: Ausgewählte Texte" and a philosophical dictionary. \nI also read a lot of books and small books about Stoicism. \n  \nI bought John Sellars Stoicism, in English, Attic Nights, in German, as well as Ciceros "Paradoxes of the Stoics" and I\'ll read them later. \n \nFor my blog and for topic-related research, I\'m usually reading a lot of books at the same time. \n  \nAt the moment I\'m mainly reading Pierre Hadots Inner Citadel in English. \n  \nI really like old books, that\'s why I bought a book called "Unterredungen mit Epiktet" (Discourses) from 1905 and "Stoa und Stoiker. Wege zu glückseligem Leben / Epiktet, Teles und Musonius" from 1948. \n  \nI often search in Reddit  for topic-related issues and I use Facebook groups for discussing the Stoic philosophy. I founded a German group where I\'m discussing issues. \n \nFor my blogging activity, I post nearly every day a stoic inspiration (like Daily Stoic – but more than  quotes).  \n \nI\'d like to inspire people and use my knowledge and understanding to help them make their life better and to arouse their interest in Stoic philosophy. \n  \nThat\'s why I translated the Stoic Week Handbook for the 2016 Stoic Week into German language. I learned a lot by translating the handbook - not only about Stoicism but also about translating. \n \nI think Stoicism is an important aspect of my life – and nevertheless I like reading about other philosophies and philosophers. I was recently taking a look at Hegel’s “Phenomenology of Spirit” and I\'m regularly visiting lectures for anthroposophy at the university in Bonn. \n \nI believe in a kind of higher order of the universe. That everything has its purpose - but I cannot prove it. So I\'d say that I\'m a pragmatic agnostic (like Epicurus, even if he wasn\'t a Stoic). \nImportant for me is that I have to deal with the things that happen - howsoever they happen. \n  \nI  used to be a member of the evangelical church until last year.  In Germany we have to pay a tax to be an official member of one of the churches. I quit the system, as I do not believe the things they tell us and in my opinion, the institution of the church in Germany does not fit into the 21st century. I\'m planning to spend the money I save for charitable institutions. \n  \nI\'d say that I\'m on the path of the prokopton - not a Stoic, yet - more an aspiring Stoic. For me, the Stoic is the Stoic Wise, the one who lives virtuous and in accord with nature.  \n  \nThere\'s still a lot for me to learn on this path, that\'s why I want to complete this course. It was, on the one hand, some kind of relief for me to read that virtue is the only good and on the other hand, a lot of new tasks and challenges revealed because of this insight. To realize that only I have the power over my "things", as Epictetus says in the first chapter of the Handbook, is still a "life changer" for me. I think there\'s a deeper level in understanding the Stoic philosophy that covers the way the human mind works and I want to discover this. \n  \nI\'d like to strengthen my self-discipline as well as master the Discipline of Desire. \n  \nI\'d like to differentiate better between the disciplines and internalize more practices into my thinking and daily practice. \n  \nSo I want to solidify my knowledge and go deeper into the philosophical theories as well as using the knowledge and practice in real life. I\'d like to be better in discussing philosophical topics in the English language. \n  \nFinally, I\'d like to meet more students, especially in German speaking countries, or in Europe (I have contact to a French group) and I want to create a real life Stoic community in Germany. \nAnd, if possible, I\'d like to help to translate this course into German language. \n \nFate permitting.', 1, '', 1, 0, 0, '', 0, '', 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 'After reading the Meditations from Marcus Aurelius, Ralph wanted to know more about Marcus\' ideas.\nHe found out that there\'s a whole philosophical school behind his very useful thoughts, that provides even more useful thoughts and perspectives on how to live a good life.\n\nThat still fascinates him.

Thanks.', 'My interest in Stoicism began many years ago. I first became aware of the works of Plutarch, Marcus Aurelius and Cicero in high school in central North Carolina at the town of Erwin, where I was fortunate to be able to acquire some of the ancient classics from our school library, as well as from a friend who gave me used copies of some of these works which he had used for his classes while in college.  Later, while an undergraduate at the University of South Florida in Tampa, I was able to expand my knowledge of the ancient classics due in no small part to the library\'s extensive collection of works on ancient history, namely the Loeb Classical Library which exposed me to translations of the works of Greek and Latin authors such as Xenophon and Cato the Elder.  One of my professors at the University of South Florida was a fount of knowledge on the deeds of the old Romans, especially those who lived through the Punic Wars, so he was able to direct me to many obscure sources dealing with the history of Rome and the war against Hannibal.  \n  Perhaps the one ancient Roman chronicled by Plutarch who made the most impression on me in my early years and was one of the Stoic individuals who had the most influence on my life and education was Marcus Porcius Cato, sometimes known as Cato the Censor or Cato the Elder.  He was a successful military leader and public servant, but what made Cato the quintessential Roman was that he attempted to live his life in harmony with the ideals and traditions of the Romans of the early Republican Period.  This austerity and simplicity of life made him stand apart from many of his contemporaries, who were already falling under the decadent influences of Greece and the East. The anecdote of Cato not allowing his wife to embrace him in public unless she was scared by a peal of thunder is a well-remembered story that says much about his views on public modesty.  I did a special project many years ago dealing with agriculture during the Roman Period, and of course his De Agri Cultura was a major source of information for that project.  Unfortunately, most of the material gathered for that specific project as well as a written report about Roman agriculture in general were lost many years ago when Hurricane Fran knocked over several trees onto my office and storage building on my land in central North Carolina, destroying the contents. \n   Although I had a basic familiarity with classical philosophers and Roman religion due to my interest in Roman history, namely the Republican Period and the Punic Wars, I never really explored the classical philosophers in depth.   The event that drew me into the realm of the Stoic philosophers was my stumbling across the works of some of the great Stoics, especially the works of Lucius Annaeus Seneca, the Younger. I also read the Discourses of Epictetus with interest. But it was Seneca who held my attention. I consumed his works with great enthusiasm, as for some unknown reason his work really appealed to me on a personal level.  I had all the more respect for him after I learned that he expounded his Stoic ideals even at the very end of his own life, which was due to his drawing the ire of a madman like Nero, whom he had once taught.  \n     I believe that religion is a personal matter, and that one’s belief or nonbelief in God is between an individual and God. That being said, I am a Christian by faith, but do not belong to any formal denomination at this time.  As a young adult I became a member of the Presbyterian Church, as I was attracted to the teachings so of John Calvin and his beliefs in predestination. I also found the simple services of the Presbyterians more in line with the teaching of the early church for simplicity and lack of ornamentation when communing with God. \n    Here is an anecdote that will perhaps give you an idea of what drew me to your school. Several years ago, while helping a student fill out a form for some sort of government program, we came across a part of the form dealing with religion. One expects to find blanks for faiths such as Catholic, Protestant, Jewish, Hindu, etc., but this form had all kinds of faiths unrecognizable to most folks. I remember saying there should be a place on there for Stoics, which led to long discussion that included discussion of Cato the Younger, Seneca, Zeno, and others. We pondered whether Stoicism is just a philosophical school, or could it be regarded as a full-fledged religion.  \n    I sincerely doubted that in our modern world based on vice, intemperance and hedonism, whether there would be a revival of a school of thought based on such noble precepts as those expounded by the old Stoics.  Imagine my surprise when one of the individuals present at that discussion all those years ago sent me a link to the website for the College of Stoic Philosophers. I never imagined there were folks around today who take an interest in such matters and share my appreciation for the Stoics.  \n    Much to my own lament, since graduating from the University of South Florida with a BA degree in History and Geography, I have not really had the time or opportunity to study works of ancient history due to professional and personal responsibilities. My graduate work focused on agricultural education, and was not in history or a similar social science related field.  Even though I have worked in the field of public history for more than twenty-five years, there have been very few opportunities to read about the ancient Romans or to study the ancient classics. I hope that by completing this course, I can gain the knowledge to move directly into the Marcus Aurelius School and perhaps even proceed into the seminary.\n', 1, '', 0, 0, 0, '', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', 1, 0, '', ''),

Perez. I was born in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic but was brought to the US in my first year of life until I was 8 years old, when my parents divorced. Growing up in the Dominican Republic was a wonderful experience. I am lucky to have grown up surrounded by loving family members and in a safe, wonderful neighborhood. The families in neighborhood, including my own, had been in there for generations. I also had the good fortune to have grown up with very good, interesting friends. These friends taught me a great deal about strategic thinking, social maneuvering and situational awareness. My greatest influence though was my grandfather. \n \n   From the time I arrived to the Dominican Republic up until the age of 14 my father lived in the US so the man who acted to some degree as a father to me was my grandfather. I learned a great deal by observing my grandfather from the way to dress to what and how to eat. The greatest gift I got from observing my grandfather was the way he organized himself. My grandfather had a personal library for both his home and his office. I couldn\'t read at the level his books were at but just the sight of those bookcases caused an emotional response within me. My grandfather passed away when I was 14 and it shook my existence. I was devastated. So much so to the point I deteriorated academically for years to come. Eventually my way to honor him became to emulate him. I started reading his books, dressing like him, eating and drinking like him. Having my grandfather in my life is the most significant event of my youth.  \n\n   My teenage years were difficult in that I was an awkward youth. My grandfather\'s death and the fact that I was not very fond of my father at the time didn\'t help. I struggled through high school and gave up on my first try at College. The solace I found was in the study of the martial arts and the fellowship it offered, drawing, poetry and journal keeping. Other than that I was an introverted fellow who socialized very little. Eventually I had a sort of awakening and everything started changing for me. I went back to my grandfather\'s books, seeking to become more like him and with the help of my father, with whom I had begun to develop a relationship, I began taking lessons. First my father retained the services of a professional mentor who taught me etiquette, oenology and writing. My grandmother contributed by sending me to my grandfather\'s tailor to have suits made for me and in retaining another mentor for me, this one in the private investigations and the use of firearms for defensive purposes. I spent a little over a year in that process and it was amazing. That year shaped me greatly and defined me in many ways.  \n\n   The following years I spent working all sorts of jobs until I decided it was time to find growth elsewhere and I decided to move back to NY. I had two beautiful children, which are my treasures, but the relationship with their mother didn\'t last. I ended up in an unhealthy relationship for the next 4 years after which I decided to forgo relationships for some time. During those difficult relationships I managed to finish the course for Credentialed Alcohol and Substance Abuse Counselor, the America Israel Friendship League\'s New York City Leadership Program, a Bachelor of Science at Touro College in Human Services - Summa Cum Laude and became a Prince Hall Freemason.  \n\n   I first became interested in Stoicism some 4 years ago. I was looking for a way to refine my way of reasoning and master my emotions so I went on the internet and, amusingly, searched "how to be like Spock" and in the article Stoicism was mentioned. I quickly abandoned the wisdom of Spock in favor of Stoicism. The first books I read on the subjects were, oddly enough, Wiegardt\'s. I then went on to read: \n\nThe Enchiridion and then the Golden Sayings of Epictetus.  \n\nGeeks to Greeks by Rohan Healy \n\nA Guide to Stoicism and How to Live Like Marcus Aurelius by Barry Sullivan \n\nStoic Spiritual Exercises by Elen Buzare \n\nThe Epictetus Club by Jeff Taylor  \n\n   I consider myself a Deist Agnostic. I believe in God but don\'t assert or deny anything else. I don\'t believe man \ncan tell me what the will of God is, I don\'t even think man could possibly understand something of that magnitude, so I stay away from organized religion, though I value whatever practical wisdom I can abstract from them. I do not belong to any religious faith, I instead look for answers in philosophy. I believe we are all brothers and sisters in this joint experience and should strive to treat each other as such. All human life has value and we should see the value in others even when they don\'t see it within themselves. I took a few courses on philosophy, most notably "Plato and his predecessors" and "Aristotle and his successors". I read short biographies on Socrates, Plato and Aristotle. Other than that I have studied Masonic Philosophy mostly. At this point I don\'t consider myself knowledgeable enough to give myself the title of Stoic, but I do put the techniques I have learned to use every opportunity I can.  At this point I consider myself more of an aspiring Stoic.  \n\n   What most interests me about the course is a the potential of obtaining a solid foundation for my studies as a Stoic. With the help of a mentor and assignments geared towards exploring the different aspects of Stoicism I hope to obtain a working knowledge of the philosophy that I can then expand upon. I have been waiting to finish my Bachelor\'s to fulfill the condition not being involved in another program of study as per the requirements of your school. When I do finish the SES I will be enrolling in a Master\'s/Doctorate program after which I will be enrolling in the Marcus Aurelius School.     \n', 1, '', 1, 0, 0, '', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', 1, 0, '', ''),

The idea of being on my death bed and feeling like I hadn’t accomplished everything I’ve wanted to accomplish in my life was, and still is, terrifying to me. Recently, as I’ve become more settled into my life outside of school, this fear and the concern that I may never find purpose in life have created an underlying anxiety that persists at all times. While it has driven me to achieve some of the important milestones I have attained in my life, it also never allows me to fully be at peace or enjoy normal times.\n\nAs a result, unknowingly, I’ve been seeking a philosophy for life to help guide me. I didn’t even know philosophy for lifes existed (assumed philosophy was all academic) until I heard the Tim Ferris podcast(s) featuring Ryan Holiday about a year ago. The terminology he used, the mindsets he took, and his general approach to life blew me away. It was like something woke up in my mind and I knew Stoicism was something I wanted to investigate further.\n\nAs life goes, other things got in the way of this investigation, but over the past month or so, I’ve spent as much of my free time as possible researching about Stoicism and reading some of the primary sources. At this point, I feel that I have a pretty good basic understanding of most of the Stoic principles and everything I’ve learned so far has made me incredibly excited to not just understand the principles, but start living them.\n\n2)	Any books you read on Stoic Philosophy. If so, please list them.\n\nThe only book I’ve read fully is On the Shortness of Life by Seneca which I absolutely loved and spurred my interest in Stoicism. I’m very excited to read more of the sources (in and outside of the class). I’ll also mention I’ve done a very thorough read (taking notes, journaling on portions I’ve read) of the Stoicism Wikipedia entry and the Reddit Stoicism FAQ, so I feel like I have a good baseline on some of the main Stoic principles although obviously there is still a lot to learn.\n\n3)	Would you call yourself an atheist, agnostic/skeptic, deist, theist?\n\nI would consider myself an agnostic. In general, I feel that there is some sort of power in the universe, but I don’t believe it’s what most of the widespread religions consider to be their interpretation of a god, and certainly don’t believe in a human manifestation of this higher power. \n\n4)	Are you a member of a religious faith? If so, which and for how long?\n\nI was raised jewish, but stopped attending Sunday school after 4th grade. While I was taught the religion, I don’t feel I ever fully believed or internalized it, so would only call myself jewish in terms of heritage. So, to answer the question directly, no, I would not consider myself to be a member of a religious faith.\n\n5)	Have you studied philosophies other than Stoicism? If so, which?\n\nI have not studied philosophies other than Stoicism. I’m familiar with some of the Buddhist meditative practices which I’ve learned through my research of Stoicism, but am not familiar with any others. It does somewhat concern me that my only data point for philosophy is Stoicism, so I will most likely do some additional research into other philosophies so I can understand better how they approach the same questions that Stoicism attempts to answer.\n\n6)	Do you consider yourself to be a Stoic?\n\nYes, I would consider myself to be Stoic, but just a very beginner level Stoic. It’s funny, when I first start reading about Stoicism, it felt like many of the concepts I read were thoughts I had previously had myself, but they were fully formed and more well-reasoned. For example, I think some part of me always knew that chasing achievements or short-term pleasure was no way to live a fulfilled life, but I hadn’t gotten to an alternative approach that would be better. When I read the concept of an ultimate goal for a stoic to live in accordance with nature and maintain Arete, I was amazed at how much that just felt right. Since learning about concepts such as the ultimate goal, I’ve attempted to start using Stoic principles in my own life, but it has been somewhat challenging with so much inertia behind my old mindsets. As a result, I consider myself to be Stoic from the standpoint of my desire to align my life with Stoic principles, but recognize I still have much work to put in before I can say I’m truly a Stoic. \n\n7)	What do you want to get from this course.\n\nMy goal is to better adopt the Stoic mentality and integrate Stoic practices into my daily life as much as possible. While one can learn about the principles, exercises, mindsets, etc from textbooks, adopting them into your own lifestyle is something that’s more difficult, so I feel that taking a more structured approach, with something like a class, will be a very valuable experience. Furthermore, I’ve only had an introduction to these principles/mindsets, so I’m excited to get deeper into the fundamentals behind Stoicism and read more of the primary sources.\n\nI’m also very excited for the mentorship aspect of this course. Through learning more about Stoicism, I’ve had the great desire to discuss what I’ve studied with others, but unfortunately, most of my traditional confidants have a hard time grasping Stoicism and take some of their prejudices about religion and philosophy into the conversation.  As a result, since I believe talking things through with another person is vital to discovery, I don’t feel as though I’ve been able to fully formulate my thoughts on what I’ve been learning, and I’m eager to have someone to discuss Stoicism with. I also know that there is much to learn outside of just textbooks and self-help books, so I’m excited to have a mentor who might be able to provide some guidance and wisdom they’ve learned from being a Stoic in the modern world.', 1, '', 0, 0, 0, '', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', 1, 0, '', ''),

My parents were from upper-middle-class backgrounds but had distanced themselves from this in the 60s and moved to the country to grow vegetables and live relatively humbly. On my father’s side was the Victorian artist Edwin Landseer and on my mother’s the industrialist Henry Spurrier. My paternal grandparents were both artists of some repute and my maternal grandfather was a research doctor at the London hospital. While my inheritance furnished my childhood with material comfort in spite of my parents’ ideals, the spectres of these figures have caused my imagination some considerable anxiety as I matured into adulthood worried that I would fail to live up to their successes and hard work. \n\nMy main subjects at school were mathematics, science and music. I studied music at university and am now a music teacher of ages 2-13 at a Quaker private school in York, England. My wife, who is another musician and teacher at the same school, and I married recently and have a child due in June. My special interests are playing the piano, which I spend around an hour a day practicing, and classical choral singing, which I developed in my adolescence as a chapel chorister. These two skills are at the core of my professional work.\n\nThere have been few defining moments or events in my life; maybe this is because I have not capitalised on the opportunities that have presented themselves, or maybe because I haven’t recognised them. When I think of the ‘best bits’, the main things that come to mind are holidays and social occasions. I have travelled extensively around America and Europe which along with attending boarding school and working in London for a few years has given me great insight into the commonalities between people of all cultures. I have also attended a few concerts which have left me deeply moved and inspired to pursue my craft of piano playing with greater zeal. My wife is a kind and loving person who I have shared some wonderful experiences with. I am grateful to my family for their love, support and good humour. I would say that other than my wife and family I don’t really have any ‘true friends’ left as I have prioritised other things over maintaining or building these relationships.\n\nI cannot remember when I first became interested in Stoicism, however I have been interested in ‘How to Live’ for many years. I can say that the book that put me on the track was ‘The Four Agreements’, not a Stoic text but one which espouses similar core values (although wrapped up in some dubious new-age terminology), and this led me to Marcus Aurelius. I had also read a variety of self-help literature before then in an effort to understand adulthood and create some structure and discipline in my life, but it all seemed to miss the point. Nowadays I read ‘Meditations’ reasonably regularly. I have not read it cover-to-cover but dip in and out. I have never had any interest in academic philosophy.\n\nDespite attending church for 8 years as a chorister, I am a ‘devout’ atheist. I used to find people’s beliefs in the supernatural incredibly self-centred and frustrating, but now I am more at peace with the persuasiveness of religion and superstition to the human mind. I would like to be able to have more balanced and exploratory conversations with people about the topic. The word ‘pantheism’ used in Stoicism bothers me as it seems like it’s just a way of bringing the word ‘God’ back into scientific understanding of the world and putting a human face on an indifferent universe. Other than having ignored a lot of church sermons, I teach at a Quaker school and find their philosophy to be similar to Stoicism in many ways, despite being centred on Christ’s teachings and the Bible. I would say that the teachings of the Quakers themselves are far more inspiring and useful than the teachings in the Bible, though that is of course a generalisation. As they are not based in any scientific study perhaps my main faith-based beliefs are that people’s insecurities deeply restrict their enjoyment of the simpler, human aspects of life, and that this leads to compensatory behaviours that are extremely damaging to themselves, society and the environment, that everyone can and should love singing if they are taught and brought up properly and that this could form part of a suitable remedy to the aforementioned affliction!\n\nI do not consider myself to be a Stoic, as there are many aspects of the way I live that are not in line with their philosophy. I am an eclectic in all areas of thought and probably will never become a ‘fundamentalist’ stoic (not that I imagine there could be such a thing), but I would like to embody their principles to a greater degree; through this I hope to attain greater self-discipline, structure and contentment, benefitting my personal, working and artistic life. I would also like to reinforce Stoic values in my teaching and make a greater contribution to society. My goals are to be healthy, live frugally and contribute to our culture through my musicianship and training others. I would also like to have more order and structure in my life. Things I have always needed to improve are my general distractedness, lack of discipline in all areas and letting friendships peter out too easily. Finally I would like to raise my children to achieve similar goals and meet whatever comes their way with contentment and action.\n\nSince reading selected texts by Marcus Aurelius, Seneca and Epictetus, as well as some modern writings on Stoicism, I have taken steps to live more in line with their philosophies. I have started to be more involved in public service through supporting refugees locally, written down my reflections in a similar way to Marcus Aurelius, and engaged in a certain amount of self-reflection and acceptance of my limitations. I hope that I have communicated my desire to develop as a person and to integrate Stoic practice into my way of life clearly in this essay and am very much looking forward to working through the course with the assistance of a mentor.\n\nJack Mackenzie\nMay 2017, York, England\n', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, '', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', 1, 0, '', ''),

I cannot recall exactly how I was introduced but my first encounter was purchasing Meditations by Marcus Aurelius at a local bookstore. I wanted the wisdom that philosophy offered but I lacked the perseverance to understand it. Ultimately I failed back to the standard corporate work and consumerist lifestyle. At this stage in my life, I was searching for wisdom and knew there would be something more in life but no one was pushing me and I became easily distracted by the lifestyles of peers and marketing. This brief encounter with Stoicism was in my twenties. I certainly wouldn’t consider myself a stoic at this point but wanted to be but couldn’t see the practicality.\nThe second and more critical introduction to Stoicism was in my thirties. My wife was pregnant with twins and she was bleeding and on the way to the hospital in the ambulance I imagined every scenario. I cannot recall if I did this on purpose or if it was a strategy I adopted from my basic knowledge of Stoicism. Either way changing perspective and visualising alternatives helped. I was calm and performed my duty to my wife and my new born children. At this point even when I was tired I decided yet again to pursue this ancient and robust philosophy of the Stoics. I decided to read some modern writing and this where I brushed up on the basics by A Guide to the Good Life by William B. Irvine. At this stage I finally understood the dichotomy of control. I am embarrassed that it took that long, perhaps it\'s because I was a parent or had enough life experiences but it is now an idea that I think of everyday. What really triggered my interest was a third event which the birth of my final son triggered an outburst of stoic research. I have written an article on my experience and the stoic ideas that helped me through this challenging time in my life, it can be found at https://medium.com/@dan.james.young/premature-fatherhood-c7a05f5f52\nI would add that I read a stoic passage or two every day. I just couldn’t get enough and without Stoic ideas I really have no idea how I could have survived.\nRecently I have read the following stoic books:\n* Meditations by Marcus Aurelius\n* Shortness of Life by Seneca\n* Enchiridion by Epictetus\n* The Obstacle is the way by Ryan Holiday\n* How to be a Stoic by Massimo Pigliucci\n* A Guide to the Good Life by William B. Irvine\nI would also consider Nicholas Taleb books, Fooled by Randomness, Black Swan and Anti-Fragile. Not only is Taleb a clearly a fan of stoicism and I find his work interesting and motivating to continue my interest in Stoicism.\nMy upbring was atheist and I remain so. However I do occasionally attend a local Buddhist meditation classes. For most part I find Buddhism and Stoicism is very compatible and Buddhism appears very rational. However I find Buddhism eventually slips into very strange rituals and dogmatism which is a reason that I would find it difficult to adopt it as a religion or philosophy. Whereas Stoic to me is immently rational but paradoxically what it does miss is rituals and a place to have lectures and practice as a community that Buddhism has. So I attend these sessions as a Stoic but as Taleb would say a “buddhist with attitude”.\nI have studied other philosophies during a brief encounter during my undergraduate studies. This course was my first brief encounter with Greek and Roman ethics however the major subjects included Utilitarianism and Existentialism. Both philosophies have impacted my thoughts. However it is hard to apply these ideas as a philosophy of life. \nMostly I consider myself a Stoic, however I do lack some confidence as how am I to judge if I am living by the Stoic ideals fully. All knowledge up to now has been self-taught.\nI hope the course will provide me: \n* Gaps in my knowledge. \n* Learn the rituals and apply them daily.\n* Motivation and direction to study further.\n* Get confidence that I do know stoic ideas and perhaps share with others.\n* Get feedback in my progress.\n* Follow a structured program that has successfully taught people how to learn and apply stoicism.\nOn reflection I must be going through a crisis as I am yet again drawn to the stoics for perspective. However this time I have an invisible crisis and one of my own making. I cannot identify the trigger but there is a pattern that is emerging that I am drawn to stoicism in period of crisis. Again I feel the need to constantly study to find perspective and manage life in a calm manner. There is hardly I time when I read stoicism I don’t find another gem that I wish I thought of it first.  I hope the course might provide me the skills to apply stoicism for the rest of my life and not only when something is wrong. This is what I think I need to get over my current malaise.\nI went searching exactly for a course like this because I recognize the limitations of self study. Not only is it slow but there is no feedback and there is no structure. Perhaps if I had started with a Modern book rather than Marcus I would have progressed my further than quickly than I have today. I was completely shocked to find such a program as this and I was starting to plan out of my own programme become an expert in Stoicism. Which I feared would result in a purchase in a library of unread books and broken promises. \nEventually I would also like the knowledge to teach my children and hopefully the wider community the wisdom of Stoicism. I see no reason why there shouldn’t be modern Stoa’s and I hope that I can once I have reached a level of maturity in my own studies help bring it.\n\n\nSincerely,\nDan Young', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, '', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', 1, 0, '', ''),

Lignite is home to about 150 people, and I truly enjoyed the childhood I had there.  The saying “it takes a village to raise a child” rings true for the way of things in Lignite as I was coming to age.  Everyone knows everyone, and with that came a sense of security, the type of security that some may find stifling and some may find liberating.  I found it the latter, and enjoyed the opportunity to try, fail, succeed, and grow among people that truly seemed to enjoy being a part of such a process.\n	I am a National Athletic Trainers’ Association Certified Athletic Trainer and a National Strength & Conditioning Association Certified Strength & Conditioning Specialist with a PhD in public health, a MSEd in health, physical education, and recreation, and a BS in biology and athletic training.  I have taught athletic training, strength & conditioning, sports nutrition, and wellness courses at the collegiate level for 12 years.  I was the program director of a university Athletic Training Education Program, have been involved in the development and implementation of athlete enhancement programs, have worked as an ergonomics and wellness specialist for an occupation medicine clinic, and have been with Chadron State College since May of 2014 where I teach a variety of nutrition, health, and wellness courses.\n	I first became interested in Stoicism about six months ago while doing research for a course I am developing called Healthy Skepticism.  It is a first year inquiry course for college freshman intended to help them navigate the sham filled world of health.  As I was reading about Skepticism, I happened upon Stoicism, and it struck a chord with me.  I later read William Irvine’s Guide to the Good Life, and his concept of a “congenital stoic” made me laugh, as I feel that I have been practicing Stoicism without knowing it all my life.  I now know that I have had the great fortune to have been raised in a family with many “congenital stoics”.  People that went through life with unwavering love for most everyone, and acceptance of most everything.  Bending, but never breaking, and always with a smile.  \n	Some of the things that I have always done, without realizing were part of the philosophy of Stoicism, are my regular use of negative visualization and acts of voluntary discomfort.  I enjoy going to grave yards, and reflecting on the unpredictability and brevity of life.  I write a short monthly column for my home town paper called Ramblings where I quite often find myself writing of the passage of time, and enjoying the present, because what came before it is gone and what is coming after is unknown and quite possibly non-existent.  For myself, knowing that this way of thinking isn’t odd, isn’t something I need to resist, has been quite liberating. \n	I have been reading quite steadily for the past few months in regards to Stoicism and philosophy in general.  Here is a list of some of the books:\nThe Obstacle Is The Way, Ryan Holiday\nZen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance, Robert Pirsig\nSartre: A Beginner’s Guide, George Myerson\nSelf-Reliance, Ralph Waldo Emerson \nSeinfeld and Philosophy, William Irwin\nThe Wisdom of Myths, Luc Ferry\nSeneca On The Shortness of Life\nThe Meditations, Marcus Aurelius\nThe Intelligent Person’s Guide to Philosophy, Roger Scruton\nThus Spoke Zarathustra, Friedrick Nietzsche\nWalden, Henry David Thoreau\nDialogical Philosophy from Kierkegaard to Buber, Shmuel Hugo Bergman\nThe Cartoon Introduction to Philosophy, Michael Patton & Kevin Cannon\nHow to Read Hume, Simon Blackburn\nPhilosophize This (podcast), Stephen West\n	I am not a member of a religious faith.  I was raised Catholic, was an altar boy and the hole bit, but it never felt quite right.  It was a leap of faith that I couldn’t make, and when I went to college I began to study world religions in an attempt to find something that spoke to my soul.  An unsuccessful attempt, but a very enlightening exercise in self-examination that has bolstered my appreciation of Stoicism.  I was what may be defined as a “militant atheist” for a few years, but I see now that much of that stance was due to my own insecurity and lack of a personal philosophy.  Now, after being exposed to the philosophies of Stoicism and Existentialism, I have softened a bit, and would say that “agnostic” would describe my views presently.  A “pleasant agnostic” at that.  I’m not out to pick a fight with anyone anymore, I just want to understand them, and actually listen to and understand their justification for what they do and do not believe.\n	As a college professor, I want to gain a deeper understanding of Stoicism so that I may purposefully interject it into my courses.  I spent the majority of my academic career learning about the sciences, and don’t recall every being exposed to a philosophy course.  If I had discovered philosophy as an undergrad, I most likely would have ditched biology, and followed a different route, but, then again, I don’t feel that I had the maturity and life experience necessary at that point.  Without stamping a label on it, I feel that the way of Stoicism would be beneficial to my students, and maybe provide some of them a bit of guidance as they prepare to move a little further along with their lives.  My courses have always been guided by the Socratic method, so the addition of Stoicism will tidy up the package a bit more for my students.\n	I do consider myself a stoic, congenitally so (as mentioned earlier), and want to develop a deeper understanding of this philosophy that resonates so profound and true with me.  As a self-proclaimed congenital stoic, I believe further knowledge in this area will, as I read somewhere, help me to “develop and refine a philosophy of life to avoid misliving”.

In order to be able to submit this form, I am including an excerpt from one of my books:\n\n_____\n\nSome of the memories we will carry with us of this Christmas have their origins in other places, other times. For example, although it takes a long time for the Welsh people to become friends, they are at least open to the idea (unlike the English – in general) and so many a pleasant interchange prior to what might be called the first degree of friendship (and there are countless degrees) are not banalities but the building blocks of the road to a genuine relationship. Take Alun ( pronounced “Ah – leeeean” with the emphasis on the second syllable).\n\nAlun is the post office man. One of them. The others are an older man, whose name I do not know, a woman, both very nice and kind and Timothy, a stout, youngish man who (I am told by several friends and colleagues) has such a fine voice that he has been offered lucrative contracts to sing professionally outside Wales, but he values his life here in this lovely town so much that he has turned them all down. He is widely known - and does sing in public when he feels like it, on television, in concert halls around the United Kingdom, and he has several CDs out. The latter by the way are displayed discreetly in the Post Office and can be purchased there if one fancies a bit of Puccini with one\'s stamps. (Can you imagine what the USPS would say to that?!) \n\nWell, Alun and I seem destined to be friends since every single time I go to the Post Office I get in line like everyone else and when my turn comes, I always get Alun. It is beyond the law of averages, and strange things happen. One day he was not on duty but came in to help out and opened the wicket at the very second my turn came. Another time it was my turn and I was just about to go up to another wicket, when the person ahead of me decided she needed to buy a money order and so I was moved over to Alun. This happens over and over - and since the British post office is much more than an American post office - [you buy your tv license there, you can pay your bills there, or deposit money in a savings account, or register your car etc.] it seems uncanny. Presumably there are other functions of the Post Office that I have not yet discovered - I can\'t wait. \n\nUnfortunately, every time I see Alun, I seem to have some problem to deal with – and to be completely incompetent about it. The car registration was a major mystery, and Alun had to interpret the vagaries of the language and intent of what would be the DMV if there was one. I don’t seem to be able to decipher what they mean, even though the forms are in relatively simple English. Sort of like those instructions that come with toys made in China: “Bend part A until it gets into the Part B. Do not bend.” That sort of thing. But British logic isn’t quite compatible with American pragmatism. Everything is much more complicated than seems necessary or efficient. Still, there are compensations, like these very pleasant encounters with Alun. Once he had to explain how to fill in the baffling forms and *pay the fees* (they charge fees!!) for re-routing the mail - which is a completely unnecessary exercise as we recently discovered.  The post office doesn\'t even put a change of address sticker on the mail that is addressed to the cottage that we rented when we first came here. They just know where we live, I guess, since it arrives at our new flat, with the old address on it. Or as we found out the other day, if we aren\'t home, it somehow mysteriously ends up at the university in our departmental mailboxes.\n\nTo make a long story short, Alun and I have forged a respectful and ethereal bond over these and several other cultural mysteries. He is very tall, very quiet, very nice looking and very polite. I know how polite he is because I used to steal a look at him when I first came in and asked for information or stamps and could see how very hard he tried not to smile at my accent (or lunacy or stupidity – I am hoping it’s just the accent). \n\nHe still obviously thinks something is highly amusing when I come in but clamps his lips together in what must be rather painfully suppressed laughter out of sheer courtesy. Usually I help him out by making a little joke so he can laugh without thinking that he is hurting my feelings. He knows that I do this on purpose and I know that he knows and he knows that I know that he knows and we get along just fine. So fine in fact, that he has conferred upon me some of the privileges of native status - a sort of honorary, mini-Welshness. I came to know this in this manner:\n\nMy stepdaughter has a rabbit. It is an uncommon rabbit with high sensitivities and a vocabulary of fifty eight words. (Understanding them, not speaking). That being the case, we sent it a Christmas present, included in the Christmas box that we sent to her. The present was an edible treat - delectable (to rabbits) seeds and dried vegetation pressed into a little bar. Everything in the box was wrapped carefully and the box taped up and I took it over to Her Majesty\'s Post Office (just across the street from the entrance to the University), and stood in line, reading my book, until I got to the front of the line, where of course Alun was available. His face brightened. Undoubtedly, he foresaw a little entertainment.\n\n"Hallo," says he very cheerfully in his lilting Welsh accent. "What will it be for you today then?"\n\n"I would like to mail this box," I say, trying to be Extremely Normal and Proper as I feel confident that I will not be making a number of ludicrous mistakes about cars and address forms and acronyms.\n\n"Oh, fine," he says, slightly disappointed. "Where is it going then - New York?" (He remembers everything, including the fact that I had sent  Richard an early Christmas present of a fleece jacket because it seemed silly to wait until Christmas since it was a cold November and he would be leaving for Long Beach right after Christmas where the jacket would be useless.)\n\n"No" I say, "New Mexico."\n\n"The States, then," he says a little uncertainly, making quite sure that I had said “New Mexico” and not Mexico.  We weigh it, I pay for the postage, and then I ask casually, as he opens a drawer to get a customs declaration sticker, "It\'s okay to send rabbit food to the States, isn\'t it?"\n\n"Oh." He looks doubtful. "I don\'t know. Is it?"\n\n"Well, I don\'t know - that\'s why I am asking you."\n\n"Well," says he in his soothing Welsh-English, "We\'ll just find out now shall we?" He bends back slightly. "Timothy," he calls over to the next wicket, "Can we send rabbit food to America?"\n\n"Noooo," booms out Timothy, in his great melodic voice, "No animal food. No, no. Not allowed."\n\nAlun turns a sad face to me. "Not allowed." he says, sympathetically.\n\n"Oh, well, then," I say quickly, "Good thing there isn\'t any in this box."\n\nBoth Alun and Timothy stop dead for a moment and look at me, speechless. \n\nThen - "No rabbit food?" they ask simultaneously.\n\n"Nope." I say.\n\nAlun starts to laugh - he really can\'t help it this time.  Timothy joins in. The people behind me in line are listening intently - all conversation has stopped. When he stops laughing, Alun says, "Anyway - we don\'t know what is in this box, do we, Tim?"\n\n"No idea at all," says Timothy. "No, no."\n\n"Well, but you\'ll have to fill out a form for the customs," Alun says, closing the drawer he had been opening. \n\n"Unfortunately," he adds somberly, "We only have Welsh customs forms at the moment. No English left."\n\n"Hmmn," I reply. "No English. Do British customs read Welsh?"\n\n"I shouldn\'t think so," he says, handing one over.\n\n"No," says Tim complacently, busying himself with a new customer. "I shouldn\'t think so either. And," he adds with operatic satisfaction, "I know the American Customs don\'t.\n\nI take the form.\n\n"Shall I fill it out for you?" Alun asks me.\n\n"No that\'s okay, thanks," I say. "I just wrote \'Pet toy.\'"\n\n"Pet toy, is it? Ah well, we never know what\'s in these boxes anyway, do we?" Alun remarks to Timothy.\n\n"Never," says Tim.\n\nThere is a pause.\n\n"Merry Christmas," says Alun, putting my parcel in the Out bin.\n\n"Merry Christmas, Alun" I reply.\n\nI walk past the long line of people, hoping that they are not cross at having been kept waiting, but as I turn to raise a hand in thanks to Alun before going out the door, I see they are all smiling.

If so, which and for how long?\n\nI was born and raised a Seventh Day Adventist.  My association with this organization continued through my first year of college (private religious academy and first year of college at PUC).  But I was very skeptical of revelation based knowledge long before then and was harassing my elders with embarrassing questions almost since grade school.  During high school academy (my sophomore year?) my need for an intellectual approach was recognized by the student counselor who gave me ‘Mere Christianity’ by CS Lewis.\n\nMy reaction to the above was atheism for a while settling into agnosticism and Secular Humanism for about two decades.\n\nDue to a quite an intense ‘conversion’ process that took ~2 years and I am convinced was my own experience of an Aristotelian type of friendship and Socratic diletical therapy I found Pantheism on my own just prior to finding Stoicism.  Of course the two fit well together.  Since then (~2000) there has been refinement but no major changes.\n\nMy approach to knowledge however is conservative and primarily skeptical.  This does not contradict Stoic theory as I understand it.  It is simply that the cognitive impression (or the conscious awareness of such) is not as frequent as the ancients thought.  What they did teach was what is not a genuine CI one must withhold judgment from.  And that follows Socrates.  I do not approach Stoic theology based primarily on faith; it is simply what is most reasonable.  Neither reasoning something out nor a genuine CI requires faith as the monotheists mean.  And certainly I allow for intuition and mysticism and spirituality.\n\nHave you studied philosophies other than Stoicism?  If so, which?\n\nI took several philosophy courses in college intending a philosophy minor at one time (getting a marketable degree and a job got in the way).  My primary interests were ancient philosophy and ethics.  Most of these courses were very helpful in particular because of the professor involved (a certain George Sessions).  The last course, ‘Contemporary Moral Issues’, was more of a political correctness class than a philosophy class and quite disappointing (it fulfilled a GE requirement).  I have continued my self education since with a very many courses from ‘the Teaching Co’ and community college night courses including ancient philosophy, philosophy of science, philosophy of religion, ethics, the free will debate, rational argument, critical thinking, logic, etc etc.\n\nAt that time I liked Plato very much and have always had a strong Rationalist streak.  Of course that followed over into Kant.  But I am not up on modern philosophy that much.  The greatest influence of any contemporary philosophical thinker on me would be Robert Pirsig and his ‘Metaphysics of Quality’ as articulated in his two books ‘Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance’ and ‘Lila’.  He never got the recognition by the academics he deserved.  Quite an intense personal odyssey and pioneering perspectives on arête, the Sophists, and Aristotle just to touch on his views into classical western philosophy.\n\nDuring my two year dialectical stint I was exposed to much New Age stuff (Deepeck Choprah etc etc) and it was during this time I got quite interested in both Taoism and Buddhism.  My friend / interlocutor was getting his psychology degree at the time so we ventured into much of the self help field including A Maslow etc.  It was a juxtaposition of spirituality, psychology, and philosophy.  We covered a lot of ground (~40 hours a week for ~2 years).  I never have had the remarkable dreams like I had then many of which I still remember.\n\nNear the end of this time I discovered Stoicism and it stuck with me the thinking personality type that I am.  My friend didn’t want to follow me there.  I find both Taoism and Heraclitus easy fits into Stoic theology and possible mysticism that is present in almost every other tradition but not so explicitly in the Stoic sources we have.  I met Keith Seddon online and we went through Chuang Tzu together.  Add to that Pirsig’s ‘Quality’.\n\nFor Stoic philosophy of mind I find a lot of parallels in Buddhism.  The Buddha was a master psychologist and the original Buddhism was not so cluttered up with social religion and supernaturalism.\n\nDo you consider yourself to be a Stoic?\n\nHmm.  I am not too fond of self labeling considering this more egotistical self stroking.  However if there was an ‘official’ school I would likely join that as opposed to any other identifiable Wisdom Tradition.  The beliefs I use for personal decisions will mostly track with Stoic principles when my attention is up enough and I am not just reacting.  But there is no denying other influence given all of the above.  I think this is true of any modern.  We cannot help but be somewhat eclectic just because of the cultural paradigm we grew up in.  To deny this is silly and not honest.  So while not quite as eclectic as Cicero perhaps I would say at least as much as either Seneca or Marcus Aurelius.\n\nAlso I think my personal journey in rejecting both monotheism and humanism gives me more of deep  appreciation of [Stoic] Pantheism than a causal student may have otherwise.  I am not sure when others profess an interest in Stoic theology if they have really been able to separate that from the beliefs of their upbringing (an over reliance on ‘faith’ for example to me is an indicator that Christianity has not been completely rejected).\n\nWhat do you want to get from this course?\n\nThis will be a good input for me to check and see if I got the basics right.  This is how the dialectic works, to bring to one’s attention possible error that one is not otherwise aware of.  I have realized that this kind of check I cannot get at the ISF where I have isolated myself for a long time.\n\nAlso I have not had support from others who have at least a similar paradigm or frame of reference.  I left the two popular paradigms of our time years ago and to place myself in a situation where I am once again immersed in those world views is just silly and not helpful for my growth (and very ironic).\n\nI am quite independent, a Libertarian, an advocate for personal responsibility, autonomy, and all of that.  But philosophy is a social project and we require interaction with others for our own benefit (and theirs).  This is a primary lesson of Socrates and even the Logical Positivists (a reaction to the wild speculation of so many single independent metaphysicians).\n', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, '', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', 1, 0, '', ''),

I have been an athlete (football wrestling, bodybuilding).  I served in both the United States Air Force and the United States Marine Corps, having been honorably discharged.  Prior to entering the business arena, I was a Licensed Physical Therapy Assistant, and Certified Personal Trainer.  I have been an entrepreneur, having owned 2 businesses (promotional marketing company and fitness center).  In my over 30 years of experience in business, I have enjoyed a career in Sales Management and Training. I attained my Bachelor’s degree from the University of Sedona in Metaphysical Studies.  I obtained my Certified Professional Coach (CPC) designation through the International Coach Academy.  Currently I am studying with the Institute of Integrative Nutrition, to be a Certified Health Coach.  \n\nI have been very involved in improving business and community in the Atlanta area. I have been an involved member, ambassador, and former committee chair with the Metro Atlanta Chamber where I was one of the top five finalists for Small Business Person of the Year.  I am a published writer and have been featured in Pause to Start, Examiner.com, and the Atlanta Business Chronicle.  I authored Coach Approach Selling, a program designed to assist professional coaches in the process of selling their services.  My passion is leadership development and have been a student of the human potential movement for over 25 years.\n\nI provided pro-bono coaching for Coaches United For Success in America, which assisted men and women who found themselves downsized during our economic downturn (2008/2009).  I have participated in raising funds for St. Baldrick’s Foundation, which partners with Cure Search in raising awareness and money for childhood cancer research by being sponsored to have my head shave in 3 consecutive years.  I have served Nspire Atlanta a non-profit program centered on the transition of homeless men and women, designing and launching their Change Agents Nspire (CAN!) internal coaching program. \n\nFor the past 4 years I have been a Regional Sales Manager with Blue Ribbon Foods, an all-natural farm to table gourmet food delivery service in the Southeast.  I enjoy serving my families and coaching and developing team members.  In addition, I am about to launch a new entrepreneurial endeavor with a good friend, First Degree Partners.  We concentrate on assisting millennials to transition from college to the workplace through training seminars, coaching, resume and social media optimization, and placement.  This will be completed and launched this month (September 2017).  My title here will be VP of Sales.  In addition to the sense of satisfaction of serving a community that is facing great challenges from living in an uncertain time, this initiative will set up my semi-retirement (I never plan to fully retire).  \n\nMy greatest accomplishment and my purpose for being on this planet, was raising my son Matt as the single custodial parent.  It was quite a challenge, as I was young when I became as single parent (25).  At the time, I did not possess the emotional maturity to tackle this task, but there is an old Zen proverb that states "When the student is ready, the teacher will appear".  So it motivated me to grow up, because he needed me to mentor him in his journey.  I had to become the hero I never had, because someone was always watching me.  He is now 35, my best friend, and continues to seek my counsel today.  We live 10 minutes from each other, and see each other at least once per week.   Currently I am owned by a canine couple, Gus & Ada.  They treat me very well, and I am proud to say I am finally housebroken.\n\nWhile I have studied Taoism, Metaphysics (Unity, Science of Mind, Divine Science, etc.), Kabbalah, and Positive Psychology, I have only recently come across Stoicism.  It seems to be the most pragmatic philosophy I have come upon.  I am reading the Daily Stoic by Ryan Holiday.  As far as my view of God while I am not affiliated with any religious entity, I am a believer.  Many of the troubling challenges we are facing in our world stems from a dogmatic and rigid view of God, as well as the demonizing of "The Other".  While religion will often require that you do not think, spirituality asks you to think more deeply as you move along your continuum.  However, as I mentioned I am a believer.  I see this deity as more of an all-encompassing energy.  An energy that none of us are separate from.  So, there is just the One (all of us).  Just like electricity or gravity, God is a force.  Just as you cannot blame electricity or gravity for the results you get, you cannot blame God.  It is our use or misuse of that power.  There is no punishment nor reward, just outcome.  There is no opposing force in the form of a Devil, just cause and effect. \n\nI have striven to be a work in progress, and have deepened my self-awareness.  I am a better man than I was a year ago, and will be a better one a year from now.  In mankind’s search for meaning, I do not believe we ever get the answers.  It is my belief that we just continually pursue them, asking deeper and deeper questions.  Creating better problems for ourselves, and going deeper into the rabbit hole.  In fact, the entire purpose of this life might be to just operate in a learning lab.  Not like a rat in a maze but with a curious mind, joyfully and deliberately going through a fun obstacle course that has no end until The End.  \n\nOutside of high school and college courses I have not studies specific philosophers or philosophies, apart from the aforementioned ones.  Oddly yes, I already consider myself a Stoic.  I have adopted the choosing of one’s response, and not necessarily assigning value judgements to the events of my life.  Also surrendering to that which is outside of my control is another practice that I do fairly well.  What I would like to get from this course is the practice.  To learn not only the theory, but more importantly the application.  This way I may live as a Stoic, and potentially mentor others in their process.  I bring a beginner’s mind, and open vessel to this teaching.\n\nThank you for this opportunity to speak ad-nauseum about myself.

This has been clarified by the Dean.', 'I can remember before attending college, which was later than most, reflecting on my purpose of being on earth. I used to discuss this with older men that I saw as being wise. I would often go fishing where other fishermen were to find people that I could talk to about these things that seemed to haunt me. After traveling to Italy to live a year and a half on my own I returned to America to go to college. I had attended some college level courses while in Italy more so to improve my language skills.\nMy undergraduate college interests were mostly in philosophy and art but being advised that one could mostly only teach in either degree led me to focus on psychology. Psychology I felt had more avenues available for work if I should go further in my education. Looking back I was correct but was more interested in philosophy with the courses I took in college. My formal education continued in psychology receiving a B.A. cum laude followed up with 2 more advanced degrees before my Ph.D. in clinical psychology. I entered into private practice after a few years of being the director of an adolescent and family center. My private practice grew quickly, I was blessed. I continued to do more reading in philosophy stumbling on stoicism and others. When my wife and I moved to Florida in 1996 for a change in our lives and for me to do some writing I became bored with writing and started to see patients in Venice. While in church one Sunday a speaker spoke on getting a masters degree in theology, which was affiliated with the Diocese of Venice that was a derivative of Barry University. My wife urged me to attend as she knew I had an interest in theology as well as philosophy. I therefore enrolled in this masters degree in theology. This degree took 5 years to complete as it was suggested to take only one course per semester as  the classes were designed to be sequential and difficult. I found my studies in theology were also discussing various philosophies, which sparked my interest even more. This came about due to the patients I was seeing that were in an existential crisis. Other than the works of Rollo May and Viktor Frankl psychology did not have the answers that were long lasting for many patients to live a meaningful and moral life. Psychological therapy is however, a valuable course of action to take as it is helpful in many situations. I eventually was asked to teach Deacon applicants counseling techniques and leadership skills. This allowed me to enter philosophy into my teaching of these religious men. This was the best of both worlds for my interests in philosophy and theology. However, my interests in philosophy continued to grow as I searched for more meaningful ways to help myself as well as my patients. I however, continually felt a pull to look deeper to explore other ways to be a good man, personally and professionally as well as for my family. I started reading more in philosophy specifically Kierkegard, Epicurus, Epictetus, Sophocles and eventually evolved into the works of Rumi, I particularly liked the books:\nThe Consolation of Philosophy  Boethius \nThe Big Questions by Lou Marinoff, \nSix Questions of Socrates by C. Phillips, \nPhilosophy for Life and other dangerous situations by J. Evans. \nMore recently Plato\'s Five Dialogues 2nd ed. \nThe work of Ernest Becker in his The Denial of Death was a strong influence in my teaching and therapy. \nI would also include the New Testament in my studies. \nAfter several years of teaching masters and doctoral students I have just semi retired as an Associate Professor and am now an Adjunct Professor at the same university. \nIn my teaching I always included Buddhism as a way to live one\'s life as well as Eastern techniques of therapy.   This opened up new worlds of interest and study for my students. I found my graduate students starving for information beyond the traditional psychology/counseling texts that they were assigned for each course. I am specifically drawn to Naikan Therapy, which has many similarities to stoicism.\nI was raised a Roman Catholic by my mother. My father was not interested in Catholicism since he was turned down by the church for some financial help he needed for the family after he was bedridden with an accident. Upon realizing he was dying from lung cancer he came back to the faith and prayed at the dinner table. \nI continue to be in good standing as a Roman Catholic but with reservations of some of their teachings. My faith however, is strong even though I only attend Mass on occasion. My wife is Jewish but does not practice that faith. When she had to have major surgery she allowed me to baptize her. Even though she did it for me she supports my faith.\nI have looked at Epicurus and the works of Montaigne as well as others and find aspects of their thinking appealing but Stoicism answers more questions to me as a way to live effectively. I love reading Seneca and Plato. Presently I am consumed with what is being presented on YouTube about philosophy with Stoicism in particular.\nAs I look back at my private practice I find that much of my interventions would fit into stoic philosophy especially when a patient had to deal with either their impending death or of another close to them. Anxiety and depression I have come to learn is better worked through by adapting stoicism in ones life.\nAs education is important to me I searched for some direction on google and in the blogs I read on stoicism. I was pleased to see that there was an organization and College that could help me clarify and improve upon my understanding of Stoicism. I was not aware of where I should begin my studies with the college and submitted my application to SES with a request to respond to me if I was in the correct place to study. For some reason my application was not received and I wrote for a reply to my initial question. Fortunately I was contacted by the Dean. My interest then in this course is to expand my understanding of Stoicism and incorporate it into my daily existence.

We moved to a farm when I was 5 and I spent many blissful years there.  I moved to Toronto @ the age of 17 and kind of went a little wild for a few years.  I had many jobs and dabbled in things that were not the best for my health. Almost 40 years ago I moved from Ontario to British Columbia and now consider that my home. I have calmed down considerably over the years and live alone with my 2 cats and a dog in a small house outside of Vancouver BC. I try to live a basic life focusing on healthy sustainable living and trying to be the best person I can be.\n \nI was raised in a home with no real religious affiliation and consider myself an atheist. I did join a Pentecostal church when I was young, but left when the new reverend came in and I found him lacking in ability to walk the talk.  I spent the next portion of my life as mostly agnostic with still a strong spiritual connection to the universe. When I was older I did do a few years exploring Spiritualism, but once again found a leader that was not following their “talk” with congruent action.  I have since been atheist with a belief in the underlying connectedness of nature.  More recently, I explored Shambhala Buddhism and have read quite a bit of Buddhist philosophy particularly in the Shambhala tradition, but do not consider myself part of any religious faith. I do have a general interest in philosophy and have taken some light courses on Coursera, but have not studied anything in depth other than Buddhism.\n \nWhen I got involved in Buddhism I started to try to meditate but was unsuccessful in making it into a habit. I have been meditating daily (with the odd skip) for the last 1.5 years.  I now practice Transcendental meditation although am struggling to always get the 2nd meditation in.  I find that it is allowing me to get past the emotional upset much faster. I have been known in the past to have a very quick temper, but am learning to choose something else.  Attempting to keep myself on a more even keel has led me to look at Stoicism.  I love what I have learned of it\nI have only known about Stoicism for approximately a year.  I read Ryan Holiday’s “The Daily Stoic” every morning before getting up.  I have read “The obstacle is the way” and am currently reading Stoicism by John Sellars and Meditations by Marcus Aurelius.\n \nIn trying to make this essay long enough, I have been thinking quite a bit about my life and why stoicism appeals to me.  I have been getting a lot of "smacks from the universe" that I really need to work on improving myself and my mental/emotional state.  I have always been someone that accepts responsibility for their mistakes, but have come to realize that I am copping an attitude and giving myself a pass on things.  For example, there was a situation at work where I was dealing with multiple issues at once and was a bit short with someone and started to get upset.  It was brought to my attention that I should have taken a moment to explore the situation mentally and realize that I was creating internal stress for myself by my attitude.  I thought that the other employee involved was not handling things well and I felt put out that I had to step in.  Really, he was allowing the situation to overwhelm him and that is why he didn\'t think things through. In other words, I was upset with him for doing exactly what I was doing.  I find that I need the practice of paying attention and reviewing all incidents to make sure I am making responsible, ethical choices.  It is only through this process that I can improve my ability to function in the world without increasing the stress of myself and those around me. \n \nConsequently, I consider myself to be a Stoic in training.  I’m definitely nowhere near what I would say to be called a stoic.  I believe though, that by applying myself and studying the course I can improve on where I am.\n \nWriting 1000 words on myself is not easy for me, and consequently this essay is definitely going to ramble a bit as I am not sure what more I can tell you.  I have, in the past made very bad choices in relationships and have had things done to me that many would consider hurtful and be in therapy for years.  I just keep on, keeping on.  I do not share very easily with others.  I tend to keep my personal life, personal and only share with those close to me. That is the one thing that makes me a bit nervous about this course. Will I need to share a lot?  Or is this the worst of it?  \n\nPlease feel free to tell me, if you think this course is not for me.  I have a full time and two part time jobs as well as hobbies so I do not have a lot of free time. I do, however, strongly wish to improve my life and think that implementing the rigors of stoicism will help. If you think I am wrong in this, please feel free to tell me so.  And now I really can’t think of more to say so I am just going to continue writing until I reach one thousand words. Only fifty five words to go so I am typing them out instead of using numerical format.  Am I the only one with this problem, I am sure you have had others as I never consider myself a “unique snowflake”  I am a member of the human culture and have many of the same struggles as others.   \n\nIf there is something I missed, that you need to know, please ask\n', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, '', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', 1, 0, '', ''),

Throughout my teen years, I can only describe myself a “douchebag”. I went tanning, worked out, wore tight shirts, and liked things that girls like so I could befriend them… I was a little girl-crazy. That being said, throughout this whole time, I still loved science, especially theoretical physics and astronomy, and logical things like chess. When it comes to character, however, I was more worried about appearing smart and cool rather than being a truly good person. You could say I was the typical 19-year-old know-it-all. \n\n	It may come as surprise to you, after reading the above, that I was and am a devout Christian. I don’t have a naturally spiritual bone in my body, and had I been raised differently, I would no doubt have been a firm atheist. But my parents were extremely religious and well versed in the Bible, and I grew up learning about God and the scriptures. When I started becoming interested in science and astronomy, I kept cross examining what I knew of the Bible with facts, and while I had my doubts, I decided that there must be a God. I will not spend too much time explaining my belief, but the flow of logic for being a Christian is as follows:\n1.	Despite a few plausible theories for abiogenesis and the state of the universe, the most obvious and simple explanation to life on earth is creation. I even reached out to a Doctor of theoretical physics who is a senior researcher at the university of Glasgow and who I had read was a Christian. I needed to understand why he believed abiogenesis was impossible, and we exchanged several e-mails about the topic; that strengthened my faith that evidence points to a creator. \n2.	If there is a creator, would he (for simplicities sake, I will assume a male pronoun, as is tradition) not have had some plan or purpose for creating us? Are we simply a science experiment? Maybe. But maybe there’s more. I already knew the Bible very well as a whole, and so many of the prophecies just made sense, and seemed to fit so well with what happened over history.\n3.	So if there is a God, and the Bible is actually an accurate message from him, should I not follow what he asks? Especially since he promises paradise? \nIt’s that flow of reason that lead me to believe something that is so contrary to what I “should” believe, according to my personality and lack or spiritual need. Over the next few years, I took a 2-year course in Massage Therapy, started teaching Massage Therapy at a college about 5 years ago, and now am taking an online university course to obtain a Bachelor of Science. \n\nMy interest in philosophy does no spring from religious or scientific interest, however. I have always been a “stoic” person in the more casual and erroneous use of the word. I rarely cry, I remain calm in the face of stress or catastrophe, I always felt that emotion was only useful after logic and reason has been applied to a situation, and I generally don’t show much emotion except contentment. Into adulthood, I did start to think about ethics and what a good person should and shouldn’t do. For example, despite spending years as a “foody”, cooking, and eating at unique and expensive restaurants, I became an ethical vegan two years ago because it became apparent to me that, in spite of my love for food, veganism was the “right” and “good” thing to do. About a year ago, I heard someone on my local radio being interviewed about his life as a modern Stoic. I was intrigued, as his way of thinking made so much sense to me. It wasn’t until a few months ago that I decided to take a step and learn about Stoicism. \nAfter a little research, it was obvious where I should start my journey: the three musketeers of Stoicism. I started chronologically, with Seneca’s Letters from a Stoic; then Epictetus’ Discourses, Fragments, and the Enchiridion (perhaps the coolest name for a book), and am a little over halfway through Marcus Aurelius’ Meditations. I also started listening to some podcasts, like Stoic Mettle, but found it… a little too basic, perhaps, and in some instances un-stoic.\n\nAs I started my last of three books, I started wondering what I would do after I finished Meditations. Should I start reading them over? I had already highlighted my favorite passages from the other two books and had reviewed them. Should I look into modern books on Stoicism? It seemed like a good place to start. But I wanted something more. I wanted to be taught stoicism, like Epictetus’ students had been. I wanted a mentor, and philosopher to whom I could ask questions. I needed someone to help me live as a Stoic today. Seneca always suggested to Lucilius to associate with other good people, with other people who thought like a Stoic. Should I not seek out the same?\n\nSo that lead me to searching for a good online stoic class. When I stumbled upon this College of Stoic Philosophy, I was delighted. I appreciated how seriously the organizers took their responsibility of teaching this life-changing school of thought. Stoicism has already changed my thinking for the best. For example, I think on a daily basis that my beloved dog will die, and it might as well be tomorrow. I live in expectation of death, injury, and other things that people call “bad”. I am more aware of my actions, and how I judge other people. But I feel as I’m not quite living a stoic life yet. My thinking certainly falls in line with Stoicism more than any other philosophy, but I don’t actively do anything to train myself. I wish so much I could go to a big city, and try living with no money, on the street, for 2 weeks, just to experience freedom from all material dependencies; but I have obligations and responsibilities as a husband to a great wife. \n\nI do plan on one day taking the MA course here (should I live past today), but I would like to start with the SES and develop some practical and essential habits on my path to being a Stoic. \n', 1, '', 0, 0, 0, '', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', 1, 0, '', '');

Lucas.  I was born in Seattle, WA on November 24th, 1982.  I went to and graduated from Cathedral City High School in California and attended College of the Desert for two years where I played basketball.  I joined the US Army in 2004 and served my country for 3.5 years.  I was stationed in Germany for two years and then was in North Carolina for the rest of the time.  While I was in Germany I got to travel around to several places which was very interesting and I enjoyed it a lot.  \n\nDuring that time I also got my degree from the University of Maryland University College in Psychology.  I then attended the University of Cincinnati and received my Master\'s degree in Criminal Justice. I took a few classes in philosophy while I was in school but at the time it did not really strike an interest in me.  I thought that it was all ancient history and I did not really need it for the current times.\n\nOnce I got out of the Army I moved back home to California and got a job at a hotel.  I did that for a short time while I was still going to school then found a job up  in Washington.  I then relocated to Washington State.   I am currently a Corrections Officer in Washington State.  Over the last fews years I have been searching for a way to live my life that was different than everyone around me.  I have found that the knowledge that I have searched for has not been easy to find.  Some of the things that I have learned recently led me to a new way of thinking about myself and my place in the world.  I really feel more different than everyone I know meaning that I need something else to make my life better.  I started reading a lot over the last few years beyond the surface reading that I was doing before.  I think that learning about how people think their way through problems struck a chord in me and I was determined to find a better way to improve myself.  Then one of the people that I know started talking about some of the reading that they do and after thinking about it for a few months I decided to start reading about the subject of Stoicism to see if there was something there for me.  Once I read my first book on it I was very intrigued because one of the people that I really respect has a very similar viewpoint which I have always been drawn to and now I know where I can learn more about it. Over the last few years I have began to do some team endurance events that have been quite enjoyable but I have noticed that people have a way of letting their minds control their actions and they end up giving up due to a lack of mental toughness.  I have always felt that my mind is really strong but there is always room for improvement and these things can be applied to every aspect of my life.  \n\nI have only recently become interested in this subject but from everything that I have read I want to learn more and develop better ways of putting it into practice myself.  I have read several books about Stoicism including:  Meditations by Marcus Aurelius and translated by Gregory Hays, How to be a Stoic by Massimo Pigliucci, Stoicism and the Art of Happiness, A Guide to the Good Life by William B. Irvine, and I am also working through Epictetus\' Discourses and Selected Writings. The books that I recently read have all had a lot of information in it but the goal of this philosophy broken down to the basics is to make the individual better in all respects. I have done a lot of things recently to improve myself physically by training and while doing that have also improved my mind but I needed a way to make those gains better and I think that this is the way to do that.  Having said that I do not believe that it will be easy but I think that any improvements where I think more and maybe react less can be a good thing.  I have recently found that I am reacting a lot to some tough situations and thinking on the subject more would help me.  Finding the way to actually doing that by studying more would be outstanding.  I had to research the terms agnostic, deist, and theist because I have never heard them before but if I had to pick one I would have to say deist because I think that there is a God but I do not feel that everyone that happens in the world good and bad is the result of the creator.  \n \nI am not a member of a religious faith and the only philosophy that I have studied was in a college course which more memorization than actually understanding what the different philosophies represented.  I do not consider myself to be a Stoic because I do not have a full understanding of the mindset that is necessary.  I am still new to  learning and reading about the subject that I do not have enough information to say that I am a Stoic, however I think that once I learn more, understand more, and actually gain experience in putting it into practice I could actually see myself using this philosophy to live my life.  I want to learn more and to learn how to read between the lines of the translated writings because when I read some of the writings I find it difficult to really  understand what they are saying.  I think that once I study more and can talk to more people with more experience with Stoicism I can get to where I can put it into practice myself.  I have done research on this subject and just learning more about it seems to be just what I need in order to have a better life.\n', 1, '', 0, 0, 0, '', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', 1, 0, '', ''),

My daughter quickly followed the next year, around the same time I changed companies and doubled my salary.\nThis started an uneasy period in my life, marriage followed by three house moves, each one bringing less happiness than the house we were leaving, filling each house with more and more unwanted material goods that papered over the lack of happiness and a feeling that life was simply passing me by, although to the outside world, I appeared very successful.\n\nSeparation followed by the time I turned 38 and I had to face, at least what I considered, a complete loss as to why my world had fallen apart and I entered the darkest period of my life as I hit rock bottom. \nAfter a short period of self-absorption, fate presented a fresh job opportunity and becoming aware of my inner state, I started weekly physiotherapy that allowed me to come to terms with events throughout my life, saw the judgements I was making were ill considered and the need to practise acceptance in my life and with those around me.\n\nTurning 40 brought a fresh lease of life, acceptance that my old life had passed away, remaining good friends with my ex-wife regardless of previous actions and I meet my current partner that for the first time in my life, gave me some amazing ‘here&now’ moments and a true sense of belonging.\nWhilst this relationship has given me some amazing positive feelings, it has also been driven in equal measure by a high amount of negative emotions that ultimately, have delivered me to the stoic philosophy and ‘letters from a stoic’, by Seneca and boom!!\n\nAt this stage in my life, I become very aware that uncontrolled desires and irrational fears were in control of my judgements and if left unchecked, would leave me in a state of seeking gratification in small measures rather than living in accordance with nature and a state of satisfaction.\n\nI also become aware that I was practising the stoic reverse clause as part of my very being, I had always been intentional with my desires and accepted the outcome, although I had been very judgemental when the desired outcome was not my own. \nNegative visualisation would have helped me live in accordance with nature when I lost my brother, when I lost my family and other difficult moments, something I have since come to practise in order to make the most of each day and the people in my life.\n\nMy stoic journey started around a year ago, drawn by the removal of negative emotions I quickly comprehended the aspect of what is/is not in my control, the need to refrain from judgement and accept what fate has decided without fear of not getting things my own way.\n\nI have never been a religious man and in recent years have almost resented the effect that religion has on people and the society in which we live. I very much believe in a spiritual existence and for thousands of years we humans have always lived in accordance with nature until the dawn of religion that removed free thought from people and falsely promised to deliver a new world order.\nWe were told to blindly have faith, follow a false god and that in our passing we would all enter the gates of heaven and be reunited with our lost loved one. Wow you would say, that’s an offer too good to be true, especially considering our evolution from 300 million years of dinosaurs and that for me, has always been a blind leap of faith that I wish not to invest in.\n\nI skimmed the surface of philosophy, yet always felt this delivered a purely theoretical view on how to live and never really got to the bottom of setting out an understanding of how humans can live alone, together and within nature. Stoicism offers all this and more, teaching us to see opportunities in everything we do, to love ourselves, our neighbours and all mankind, something I have always believed in from a young man and even more so today.\n\nI would consider myself a natural stoic who until recently, was unaware of stoicism.\nI have always been ready for the worst possible outcome, although only in day to day situations and not through negative visualisation. \nI have always known that being in and being one with nature is the true path happiness, not the size of your house or the unwanted material items you purchase, nor the money in your bank or the latest model of car and stoicism aligns with the way I intend to lead the second half of my life.\n\nIn studying stoicism, it is my intention to become consciously aware of my desires and fears and have the strength to endure and renounce, letting fate work through me, not me against her. \nFor too long I have been driven by my judgement of events, not by the event itself and through stoicism I see a path to refrain from judgement and catch my emotions before they take over and allow acceptance into my life, which in time I hope we bring me to a life free from passion and full of love.\n\nLonger term, a stoic way of life in the modern world is needed more and more and as the next generation of screen dwellers come through, there is going to need to be a cultural change in the way this generation takes care for themselves, their neighbours and the world at large and through the stoic practise, I would like to help others find the same path I am about to start down.\n\nSimon Roberts\n24th November 2017\n', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, '', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', 1, 0, '', ''),

I went to Catholic schools my whole life, including a Catholic university.\nAround the age of 16, I started questioning my belief and pretty much stopped attending church. Not that it was a big deal or so, it just happened.\nAfter secondary school, I studied to become a land surveyor. I loved the outdoors, was pretty comfortable with math and technical drawings, so it was all good. I then did my military service, which was still mandatory at the time, partly in Belgium and partly in Germany. This was at the beginning of the eighties. The economy wasn’t great in those days and instead of finding a job after finishing my military service, I decided to go back to school. This time university, where I graduated as a Master of Applied Informatics in 1989. I then took up a position as a researcher at the university where I graduated. Over the next 2 years, I did research on load balancing in heterogeneous computing environments. Somewhat interesting, but not too much. I was more interested in exploring the world. After those two years working at the university, I managed to get a position as junior field expert for the United Nations. My post was in Lagos, Nigeria. The project to which I was assigned, was the Nigeria 1991 census. Shortly before leaving Belgium my wife and I got married, so she could join me to Nigeria.\nOur time in Nigeria was well spent, the first 3 months were extremely difficult, but after that, when our minds were made up to stay, things became easier and eventually enjoyable. After 4 months in Lagos, we were assigned to a post in Kano, situated in the northern part of Nigeria where 95%of the inhabitants are Muslim. It was all very, very interesting an eye-opeing. If I think back to that period now, I believe we showed some ‘stoic’ behavior back then.\nWhen the project finished, we went back to Belgium. Not in any hurry to get back to work, we decided to do some traveling, this time through Europe, on a motorbike. And that’s what we did, for 4 months, each on our own motorbike.\nAfter that, we decided to travel to South Africa for 2 months, to visit my wife’s sister and explore the country. That brings us to the beginning of 1994.\nSouth Africa was a very interesting place at the time, Mandela was released a few years before and the first free elections were scheduled to take place in April of that year. We liked it so much that we decided to try and stay in South Africa, more specifically in Johannesburg.\nI started working again in February 1994 as a database programmer. A year later I moved to another job and started working as a system analyst with the South African Breweries. There I stayed for about 5 years. In 2001 I started a company together with 2 colleagues. Our company specializes in Enterprise Architecture, offering consulting services and educational services. I was the technical director for the company until 2 years ago when I sold most of my shares and started working part-time as a trainer in the educational department.\nMy wife and I have been together for about 27 years, our first daughter was born on 11 May 2000 and our second daughter on the 11 December 2001.\nMy wife is a primary school teacher, back in Belgium she specialized in working with autistic children, in South Africa she worked for about 6 years with children who have mental and physical disabilities. And now since many years, she teaches at the Dutch primary school in Johannesburg and Pretoria.\n\nHow long you have been interested in Stoicism.\n=====================================\nConsciously, only a few weeks. Unconsciously, maybe many years.\nWhen I drive to work, I often listen to a ‘philosophy bites’ podcast. A few weeks ago, I listened to an interview with William B. Irvine on his book ‘A Guide to the Good Life’. The same day I got a copy of that book and started reading. \nI was pleasantly surprised and at the same time a bit disappointed. \nDisappointed in myself, because over the last years I have read a number of books that have some connection or references to stoicism, but I always failed to see what was staring me in the face. Stoicism is something that I must look into.\nAlso, one of my favorite quotes since many years is “It is not because things are difficult that we do not dare, it is because we do not dare that they are difficult”. I don’t have to tell you who this is from, but it is striking that I deeply agree with this saying and at the same time know so little about the man who said it and what he stood for.\nI don’t know a lot about stoicism so far, but I’m looking forward to learning more about it and put it into practice.\n\nAny books you read on Stoic philosophy. If any, please list them.\n===================================================\nA Guide to the Good Life - The Ancient Art of Stoic Joy - William B. Irvine\n\nWould you call yourself an atheist, agnostic/skeptic, deist, theist?\n===================================================\nAgnostic.\n\nAre you a member of a religious faith? If so, which and for how long?\n======================================================\nNo.\n\nHave you studied philosophies other than Stoicism? If so, which?\n===================================================\nNone.\n\nDo you consider yourself to be a Stoic?\n===============================\nNo.\n\nWhat you want to get from this course.\n===============================\nIn short: I want to be a better person.\nBut I guess I need to give you the full story in order to get to my 1000 words.\nSome five years ago my 50th birthday was nearing. At the time, the oldest of my two daughters was 12 and I wasn’t living a very healthy lifestyle. Pondering about the future, I thought it would be great for me to experience the birth of my grandchildren, even better, it would be fantastic to see them grow up and have children themselves. A quick calculation told me I would at least have to become 80 (and more likely 90) to make that happen.\nThen, a few months later I read a biography of a woman who had a medical degree, but instead of practicing classical medicine, she ran a wellness center that emphasized the importance of understanding our physical self in relation to nature. This book had such a great impact on me, that I decided to investigate further.\nShortly after that, I made a decision. The goal that I set for myself was simple, I wanted to become 100 years old.\nThat was the goal, the plan would follow.\nAnd it did. I came across a book written by one of the most successful triathletes in the world. He is a vegan. That book also made a big impression on me, and so I took steps to change my diet. These days, I can say my diet is +90% plant-based.\nMy life in terms of physical activities changed dramatically. I have a daily routine that involves a series of Tibetan yoga exercises and I cycle at least 5 times a week. My heart rate has improved a lot and I’m slowly but surely getting rid of my breathing challenges.\nNow, 5 years later, my goal has not changed and I can safely say that I feel a lot better than even 10 years ago. So far, so good.\nYes, my goal is still there, but I think it the plan can be improved upon.\nThe plan so far mainly addresses the body that I am using. Our bodies have been designed to last for more than 100 years, provided we look after them. But what about the mind?\nThe improvement to my plan that I believe has to happen in order for me to reach my goal, needs to address exactly that. The mind.\nAnd that is what I’m hoping to get from this course.', 1, '', 0, 0, 0, '', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', 1, 0, '', ''),

Am I in time to start tomorrow\'s class?', 'My interest in Stoicism began last year when searching for an effective hack to help me through a difficult life situation. Three years ago my then eleven year old daughter expressed to her other mother, my ex life partner, that she did not want to see me. Since then our family has suffered through a difficult couple of years leading to the deterioration of her mental health and diagnosis of anxiety and depression amongst other conditions. We are currently attending Dialectical Behavior Family Therapy (DBT) and I find that with its emphasis on mindfulness, focus on reality, perception and validation, it shares common elements with Stoicism. They teach us to make decisions from our “wise mind” which is where our rational/logical and emotional minds intersect. DBT helps people create “a life worth living”. We are given homework assignments every week to put what we learn into practice. For this I am truly grateful. \n\nI was born and raised Catholic and although this religion comforts me it is mostly due to its familiarity.  I feel comfortable within the confines of it. I believe Jesus was the child of God as I believe we all are. I believe he was divine as I believe we all are. Not a fan of organized religion I do however consider myself spiritual but not in the new age sense of the word. It is a personal relationship with the primary creator that I seek, a connection. I am also strong advocate of the mentor/disciple relationship and Jesus is as good a role model as I’ll get for my needs. When I take in nature all around me I can’t help but believe there is an Alpha, a God, a divine intelligence, call it what you may, much greater than us that propelled such beauty and organization. \nI was recently persuaded by a Buddhist friend to look into Nichiren Buddhism and attend group meetings where we chant Nam-Myoho-Renge-Kyo while expressing devotion to the mystic law of cause and effect. The goal of Buddhahood and helping others be happy is a noble one but again I find myself resisting the insistent calls by group members to attend numerous scheduled weekly chanting sessions. I don’t attend Catholic Mass either except on the occasions of special sacraments and holidays if only for family, fellowship and the sake of ritual and tradition. \n\nNot a fan of organized religion I do however consider myself spiritual but not in the new age sense of the word. I suppose I am a Deist although not too sure of these labels. I believe myself a co-creator of my life and this world we live in. I believe a higher intelligence set natural laws into place that we are governed by yet is not micro managing our existence. I believe I can make a difference, an impact in our world. If even to one person at a time, myself included, so be it. I feel fulfilled, accomplished and of service.\n\nDuring high school many moons ago my humanities class teacher awakened an interest in philosophy in me. I revisited this interest a few years ago and bought a book written by Lou Marinoff called Plato, Not Prozac. It sits on my shelf as a reference book that I open from time to time. The study of human behavior and philosophy to ease the burdened mind makes sense to me. This led me to Ryan Holiday’s audio book The Obstacle is the Way. Since then I have been researching Stoicism and found that my perception of it has been wrong all along. I thought the Stoic was a cold, uncaring, boring grump. I have begun to journal in Holiday’s accompanying The Daily Stoic Journal; 366 days of Writing and Reflections on the Art of Living. My intention now is to read the great masters of Stoicism among them Epictetus, Seneca and Marcus Aurelius.\n\nSo far the tenets of Stoicism as I understand them also share some tenets of Buddhism. Stoicism helps me navigate my days with a new mindset. It isn’t some abstract or esoteric philosophy but a practical one.  I’ve always told my daughter that we can’t control everything in life and to focus on those things that we can and to strive to do the best we can given our personal situations. I tell her that we are our choices and to be grateful for what we have because so many have it much worse. These are words of wisdom offered by a mother to her daughter. I’d like to help her implement this wisdom…to live by these words one day. I want to be strong and ready when we reunite one day in the future. \n\nIn my opinion Stoicism is a blend of philosophy, psychology and spirituality…the Holy Trinity so to speak. I am a life long learner and an education that enhances my intelligence, intellect and soul is befitting such a personality.\nIn today’s fast paced and social media world our children are learning to hide behind the screen and when they get a chance to interact “live” (with a long “i) with real people they are at a loss on how to behave and the emotional consequences of these interactions. I’d like to be of service in this arena. Whether my audience is children or corporations I want to become better educated and communicate that Stoicism is a tool to guide us by not evading harsh realities of life but by embracing them as opportunities to a much better one. Denial of reality and procrastination can cause unhappiness and potential depression as we become stagnant immersed in self sabotaging thoughts, feelings and emotions.   \n\nWe humans are disturbed not by actual events in our lives but by our views and perceptions of these events. Stoicism helps us change our perceptions of these events and to keep more joy in our lives. I want to communicate this as it is my way of offering peace and understanding to people who have so much and feel they have so little…another way to create “a life worth living”. A happy life.\n\n\n', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, '', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', 1, 0, '', ''),

I am not married, but I live with my fiancée and we have a 1-year old son.\n\nWhen I was younger, I studied art history and artistic drawing, but I quit because I did not have enough creativity to have a career, and because I found out how interesting computers could be.\n\nI have been working as a web software engineer since 2008. I learned the profession by myself and I love what I do. Currently I work from home for a company in Rio de Janeiro. I travel to the company office three or four times a year and spend around a week there, working, teaching programming and new technologies, and meeting my friends. Working home allows me to have extra free time for my personal studies and to watch my son growing up.\n\nAfter years of starting and quitting in university courses, in 2014 I got a college degree in Management Processes, a field I do not particularly like, but that I finished anyway to finally have a diploma and improve my knowledge about the business rules of the software I work with.\n\nI am currently finishing the last year of a degree in Systems Analysis and Development, which is my true interest field, and a specialization in Web Programs and Applications.\n\nI am a nerd, my hobbies include:\n\n•	computer programming, specially building systems for the Internet and mobile applications;\n•	reading books, especially on occultism, religion and computer science, or Stephen King novels;\n•	manhwas and graphic novels, especially those about deeper subjects, such as the works of Alan Moore and Neil Gaiman;\n•	computer video games that have a good story, because I consider them the most comprehensive art form (writers, sculptors, artists, musicians, singers, engineers, software developers, etc.);\n•	watching movies TV series, especially horror, science fiction and fantasy, I do not like reality shows, soap operas, sports or news.\n\nRegarding my personality, I am an introvert, but not timid. I more concerned with reasoning than emotions. I have a lot of energy for what interests me, and I am very lazy for what I dislike. I am patient with bullshit, but anxious for things I am expecting to happen or arrive. People say I am very smart, but in truth I only know deeply the subjects that interest me, I lack a lot of basic knowledge regarding house and life affairs.\n\nI was not attracted to Philosophy when I was younger, but I got a taste for alternative religions and I had access to a bit of it disguised as esotericism.\n\nWhen I was around 16 years old, I started studying the works of Aleister Crowley and his religion or philosophy called “Thelema”. Since that time, I consider myself to be a Thelemite. That “religion” or “way of life” does not require me to believe in this or that, but personally I believe neither in the existence nor in the non-existence of god, but for being practical, I just assume there is no god, but men.\n\nThrough the Thelemic teachings I realized life should not be just studying, getting a job, marrying, having children, retiring and dying. Life should have a purpose besides surviving and having offspring, but since there is no god to give me any, what better purpose than to fulfill my true nature, to be myself?\n\nI think being ourselves and doing our true wills is very productive: if a person does what really suits him, if he employs the best of the skills he was born with, then the world would be better, because that person would be more productive doing what makes him happy and applying his skills fully. The “human resources of the world” would be better employed for the benefit of mankind, the whole civilization would be more efficient.\n\nTo be happier and do better, I must know who I really am. By knowing myself I do not mean knowing the current personality I have, or the person my ego would like to be, but my true self, the pure and original “me” before being shaped and changed by the way my parents raised me, by pressure of society, by my friends, by my fears, desires, bias, etc. I want to be the truest and best Alan I can be, the way nature made me.\n\nBeing myself also includes discovering new things I may be good at, but that I never explored because I neglected as being “wrong”, “stupid”, “boring”, “hard”, etc. The more experiences I have, the better will be the chances to get near my full skills set.\n\nIn the past few years I looked for different esoteric schools trying to understand more about the world and myself, but unfortunately most of them are lost in endless occult discourses and jargons, and have no focus in true personal growing.\n\nIn one of the few good ones, I came to know Justin Joyner, who happens to be a member of the College of Stoic Philosophers. In our correspondences he said some of my opinions were similar to the teachings of Stoicism, and he suggested me to read the Enchiridion and the Meditations of Marcus Aurelius. I really liked those books and saw that many things there resembled my own ideas, but besides that, I was impressed because they teach a *practical* method of applying philosophical knowledge to the everyday life, it was not just theory. However, since I am totally new to the subject, I lack a proper introduction in order to better apply the way of Stoicism to my life, so here I am.\n\nThrough the College of Stoic Philosophers course, I intend to:\n\n•	Know more about who I really am and where am I going to;\n•	Be less affected by external events beyond my control;\n•	Learn more about the history and the way of Stoicism;\n•	Live a happier life.\n\nThank you for your time,\n\nAlan Willms', 1, '', 0, 0, 0, '', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', 0x4d444d774e7a45354f446b3d, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', 1, 0, '', ''),

At that time (May 2017), I experienced a difficult time at work and sought to better understand the source of my pain and confusion, primarily to relieve them but also to learn and understand myself to better manage my responses to life in the future.\n\nSince then, I have read The Daily Stoic by Ryan Halliday, which I found most helpful in this regard.  I found the philosophy to be primarily a consolation, but I recognise that it has great power to be a tool for living.  What I have struggled with, however, is the discipline to invoke Stoic thoughts and behaviours "in the moment".  I have also read books that might best be described as \'self-help\' and I recognised in them many Stoic principles: "The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck: A Counterintuitive Approach to Living a Good Life" by Mark Manson, and "Be Bulletproof: How to Achieve Success in Tough Times at Work" by James Brooke and  Simon Brooke. This recognition has motivated me to learn more about Stoicism: I suspect it is at the core of many modern self-help approaches, so I would like to study the source rather than various popular interpretations of the philosophy, at least at this early stage of my understanding.\n\nI would call myself an atheist.  I favour science over superstition and evidence over faith.  I believe humans have a tendency to place themselves at the centre of the universe, so to speak, and seek external meaning and purpose for their existence, typically in the form of divinity.  Unsurprisingly therefore, I am not a member of any religious faith. However, I would like to learn how to live purposefully in the absence of the concept of a god or concepts of afterlife/reincarnation, hence my interest in Stoicism.  \n\nI have not studied philosophies other than Stoicism in any disciplined manner. I am, however, interested in the Buddhism, but only insofar as it is a philosophy rather than a dogmatic code.  I reject all notions of holiness and salvation through enlightenment, but I am attracted to its concepts of non-attachment and examination of one\'s mind.  Hence another source of my interest in Stoicism: I wonder if it represents a purely secular approach to these goals.  Nonetheless, I am interested in the similarities and differences between Stoicism and Buddhism. I plan to undertake a five week/10-hour introduction to Buddhism course in May 2018.  I have done a secular meditation course through the Buddhist organisation that is offering the course and found it to be highly beneficial in calming and decluttering my mind and achieving a sense of equanimity.  The idea that this is a state that is always attainable through one\'s own efforts regardless of external circumstances is very appealing.  \nAs well as this comparative aspect Stoicism, I am also interested in its historical context: how it fits into the other schools of philosophy from Greek and Roman history and what its historical influences have been. I have begun a short online course offered by the University of Pennsylvania through the Coursera platform called "Ancient Philosophy: Plato & His Predecessors".  It is my hope that knowing something of the people behind the philosophy, their motivations and challenges, will enrich my study of Stoicism.  \n\nI do not consider myself to be a Stoic; that would be far too presumptuous.   I have a superficial understanding of the tenets of Stoicism, but it is not yet integrated into my daily life and way of thinking.   However, I think I would like to be a Stoic based on my understanding thus far and I believe with greater knowledge of the philosophy and with daily practice, I might be. \n\nI would like to achieve two things from this course: firstly, I would like a deeper knowledge of the tenets and principles of Stoicism.  There have been certain concepts that I have discovered so far that have confused me and sent me running straight to Google for interpretation.  For example, the notion that our opinions are the source of suffering. I could not understand this at all initially, as I had a strongly held view that some behaviours are simply wrong and therefore one could be justifiably frustrated or angry when one encountered them.  The prospect that Stoicism was telling me that this strongly held view is just an opinion and as such should be abandoned, was deeply troubling to me:  are there no ethical or moral foundations we can cling to? How can we maintain authenticity and integrity if nothing is objectively wrong and therefore unacceptable? Through reading and reflection however, I came to an understanding that allowed me to accept this Stoic principle and even resonate with it: whilst the "wrongness" of any behaviour is an opinion, it was not this particular opinion that was the cause of my suffering.  Rather, it was the opinion that such behaviour should not exist, at least in that situation, from people who purport to adhere to a set of corporate values.  My opinion that people should play by certain rules of fairness was the opinion that was causing me to suffer.  I am still unsure how to reconcile this new understating with a desire not to be cynical, but at least my initial impulse to reject it has been replaced by acceptance gained through study and reflection.  I would like to continue this study and reflection through this course.\n\nSecondly, I would like this course to help me to integrate Stoicism into my daily life and way of thinking.  I\'d like to better understand how to develop Stoic behaviours, not just know what they are - some of them seem so aspirational and unattainable in real life e.g. I accept the idea that anger is more damaging to me rather than the object of my anger, but what practical steps should I take to not get angry, or better manage my anger?  I know I\'ll benefit from a structured course to gain this, because I find it hard to dedicate regular time for dedicated study without the external motivation of a course. \n\n\n', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, '', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', 1, 0, '', '');

I can write about almost anything, but an autobiographical essay is indeed a challenge. Since I haven’t done this before, please bear with me as I attempt to relay what’s pertinent.\n\nI was born in Lisbon, Portugal on the 13th June 1971. For the next ten years, I was raised by my illiterate grandmother while my parents worked various professions. My father, a special forces commando and then a specialised welder kept him working abroad constantly. My mother, as a seamstress and then a saleswoman for the top insurance company at that time.  At the age of ten, we immigrated to Perth, Australia; my parents, 1yo. sister and I. The culture shock was quite confronting. My father being quad-lingual (Portuguese, Spanish, French, English) was away welding in Western Australia’s mining boom, leaving us quite perplexed and challenged with understanding the culture and language. My mother and I didn’t speak a word of english.1\n\nI was never particularly academically proficient in my youth (that came later), but I was a keen gymnast and martial artist. A neck injury during gymnastics ended my participation with the sport at 17, but I continued with Martial Arts for the rest of my life. Ranging from Karate to Aikido. Aikido is I feel the style that meshed with me the most and I therefore never returned to another style afterwards. Most of my twenties were unspectacular. I worked as a coded welder during the day and worked in clubs at night. It was fun, fast and frivolous. That is until I reached 28 years of age where my mind turned on itself: an existential crisis leading to severe depression. \n\nI don’t know why it happened explicitly. Perhaps it was the break-up of a long-term relationship to a woman whose children I had raised and loved as my own, or maybe I looked in the mirror and wasn’t the “man” my father had conditioned me to believe to be; alternatively, all the psychology and philosophical books I was reading reached a critical mass; perhaps it was just the way the stars were aligned or all of the above. Either way, I hated what I saw in the mirror and for the next few years escaped into raves, sex and ecstacy. While I don’t condone this kind of behaviour, to be honest, it helped me, particularly the ecstacy. You see I’ve never enjoyed alcohol (been drunk twice, on purpose) or drugs for that matter because I loved to think, and anything that dulled my capacity to think or be aware of my surroundings just didn’t interest me. Ecstacy however, was a different story. It opened my mind and my emotions to states I didn’t even know possible. I was profoundly connecting with people for the first time, feeling the human race and the cosmos as one. Drug-induced or not, to feel this through every fibre of my being was mind-altering enough whereby I would take it as a method of self-exploration rather than pure entertainment. Eventually, even though I was an irregular user, the drawbacks started to outweigh the benefits, so I stopped. But I do understand now how trials using MDMA on people with PTSD is so effective in curing them. \n\nAfter a brief sojourn in Europe, I returned to Australia and embarked on the first steps into “adulthood”. I won a scholarship into Graphic design but left that to complete a diploma in multimedia and web design. My graduation coincided with the dot-com bubble which meant no work in a small city like Perth. So, I returned to study bodywork, particularly Structural Integration (Rolfing) of which I was very good at. I eventually opened my clinic and taught both bodywork and movement in Australia and Canada. I had arrived! After so many years of confusion and pain, I was finally successful, worked in a profession that fulfilled me daily, was financially secure, studying philosophy at university and in love with a woman in Canada - a country I felt at home in and intended on emigrating to very soon. Then, life bitch-slapped me again down to size: I was diagnosed with ALS (Motor Neuron Disease) in December 2005. A 2-year terminal diagnosis was not what I planned for as a 34-year-old. \n\nThe next 2 - 4 years were spent researching every avenue for a way to at least slow down progression. In that time I lost many things. My ability to use my hands first, then my beloved career, my body, my partner, my friends. Slowly but surely everything goes bit by bit. Every week one loses a bit more function, and you know it’s not going to come back. This isn’t an illness one recovers from nor like cancer, whereby a treatment may offer a cure. There’s no treatment, drugs to slow it down or hope: just the inevitable future of being fully conscious and aware in a wholly paralysed body. That’s what messes with your head, the hope of a cure but the reality of waking up every day and finding a reason to go on, because it’s always going to get worse - for the rest of your short, entirely dependent, no privacy, life. It’s a hard pill to swallow every morning!\n\nIn this gauntlet, many things were lost, but ultimately my illusion of life was the most integral. Life was not rainbows and unicorns anyway, but it wasn’t going to reward me for being right or working hard or doing anything in particular either. It was what it was, with or without me, it made no difference. I think the hardest truth to realise was that the body was an absolute bag of rotting meat, bone, faeces, bacteria and liquids, which despite my following the “rules” of health, broke down on me anyway - for no explicable reason: and that made me so very bitter.\n\nStill, whether fate smiles on us or not is irrelevant: a man still has to support himself. I can’t use my hands, but I can use my mind and so I started a business online which I still successfully run today, selling herbs. In looking for a cure, I used my past naturopathic experience to experiment with various herbs and supplements. I eventually completed a diploma in Western Herbal Medicine in 2013 and consulted online with various clients. \n\nIn 2012 I also started a double law/business degree but eventually changed to continue with Philosophy - which I’m still doing today. Although to be honest, apart from Nietzsche and Schopenhauer, my interest is firmly ground in greek and post-Socratic (Stoic) philosophy. For the simple reason that they viewed philosophy as a guide to life rather than verbal and semantic jousting, which seems to be where academic philosophy appears to reside in. The reward ultimately came, as Aristotle pointed out, in virtue itself. Where does Stoicism come into this?\n\nWell, back in my martial arts days, I was a student and fan of Zen Buddhism. I particularly liked Zen over the other traditions3 because of its focus on work, i.e., its emphasis on mindfulness and practice during work. I wasn’t attracted to the ritualistic and fanfare of Tibetan or Theravada Buddhism, preferring the simplicity and no-nonsense of Zen practice. Nevertheless, it’s still an Asian tradition with strong cultural tones I can’t ever fully feel at home in. Thus, when I read about Stoicism for the first time, it was like seeing a long, lost friend. The same practice of Zen with the intellectual rigour typical to the Western mind: it was beautiful. \n\nI read Mussonius, Epictetus (My favourites), Zeno, Heraclitus, Seneca and Marcus Aurelius’s works and books on Stoicism from other authors. Philosophy for Life, A guide to the good life and Stoicism (Sellars). I also participated in 2014 Live like a stoic week. Nevertheless, regardless of the books and all the knowledge about Stoicism, I feel my stoicism has come about from challenges. The books and texts have given my choices a name, but I can’t say I am a proper stoic in the classical sage sense. I forget, I still get attached, I still want to control, I get angry, frustrated and lonely. This illness takes my dignity slowly and shows me how irrelevant it is; and yet, I hold on and suffer. I can tell you I’ve been prepared to “check-out” more times than I can remember - but somehow there’s that niggling feeling that would be a cop-out: an easy way out. \n\nWhich leads me finally to the reason I want to study Stoicism with NewStoa: mentoring. If there’s one thing I know the value of, is one to one instruction. I’ve mentored students in both martial arts and bodywork and have been mentored myself, and to me at least, I find this method of tutelage the most profound, practical and apt for anything deeply personal, such as philosophy. I hope that by being mentored personally by someone much more experienced and knowledgeable in this incredibly rich tradition, can help me to have a more profound affinity with reality and therefore peace. Hopefully, if I feel in the future that I have a more organic grasp of these principles in practice, that I may be of service to someone else in my situation. That’s my bottom-line, final wish for my life: to serve by example someone most in need of these ancient teachings, so they don’t suffer the way I did. \n\nThus, my request in this essay, if I may be so bold, is to do the MA training without the SES course beforehand. I hope that outlining my practical and theoretical experience will suffice to convince you an introductory course is unnecessary. That furthermore, I can handle the MA training quite efficiently. Also, the deteriorative nature of my disease means as time goes by, I’ll have less function, requiring more physical effort and making writing exponentially more tiring. A year is a long time. A year and three months + waiting list time is longer still. I sincerely hope you can accept me into your MA program at your earliest opening with a highly experienced mentor. What you’ll receive in return is a highly dedicated and interested, middle-aged student with no illusions about the subject matter.\n\nI sincerely hope this essay wasn’t too verbose, but rather a sequential timeline of relevant events that lead me to where and who I am today. \n\nWarmest regards, \nJorge Tendeiro', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, '', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', 1, 0, '', ''),

I\'m married with a house and two dogs which I consider practice children. I\'m somewhat high strung and opinionated which sometimes causes me to butt heads with others, though that has greatly diminished over the years. When I was twenty-four, I began to have heart issues. My heart was constantly skipping beats. I was prescribed as beta blocker to reduce my blood pressure, though the issue persisted because of a diagnosed electrical problem with my heart. I can say that this searchs as my BC-AD moment. For the first time in my life, I really took a focus on my health and began cycling. Within two years, I had lost eighty pounds and was no longer on the medication. This weight loss saved my body from death but I felt like I was still dying. I was stressed. I felt like I had limited agency in the direction I going. My world view changed. The way people, especially other women, spoke to me changed. This caused a rift in my marriage that we\'re still working to fully correct, but we\'re on the right path.\n\n\nI was introduced to Stoicism a little more than a year ago by a friend recognized that I needed some help righting the ship of my life. She recommended a book called Go Suck a Lemon about Emotional Intelligence. There was a quote in that book from Epictetus that I found succinct and deeply resonant with me: "I find people are not disturbed by things but by their view of things."  That lead to read Enchiridion and Meditations. I found Epictetus to be cut and dry almost to the point of harshness (perhaps because he was a disabled slave). I found Marcus Aurelius to be a tad dramatic (perhaps because it\'s a collection of his personal musings). Later I began reading Letters From a Stoic. So far, I\'ve appreciated Seneca\'s take on Stoicism and his practical application of the teachings. He managed to strike a refreshing balance between the dogma and its real-world implementation.\n \n\nDogma was something I was not introduced to as a child. I was raised without religion and when I later asked my mother why, she said it was because she wanted me to figure it out on my own. I now consider this to be a blessing and a curse. It\'s a blessing because I watch people lie to themselves for happiness. It\'s a curse because they appear (emphasis on appear) happier. Additionally, they have a compass trained into them at a young age whereas I believe I learned how to live well by trial and error and by observation of nature. Still, I hold no grudges against my mother nor my friends who are religious. I\'ve always been a curious onlooker to people of faith, watching some cling tightly while others reject their faith outright, sometimes violently. If I\'m honest, I find the existence of God to be irrelevant. To give it a word, I\'d consider myself a Deist. We might very well have a divine creator; however, he does not appear to check in on us nor interact with us very often.\n\n\nBeing someone who doesn\'t prescribe to the idea that reverence for our creator is a requirement for living a good, meaningful life, I embarked on a journey to find something to slot into my life where religion and God fit for many other people. I was dimly aware that I needed guidance in the areas of my life where others relied on religion. That project led me to explore the words of Lau Tzu\'s Dao Te Ching and Zen Buddhism. I should note that I do not consider Buddhism to be a religion, at least not in the same sense that Christianity is. While it contains trace amounts of the supernatural, I really gravitated towards the practical application of the teaching, specifically around the causes of suffering and the benefits of meditative practice. There are ideas within Stoicism that reminded me of teachings I really gravitated towards in my other studies. From Daoism, the phrase "yield and overcome" which emphasizes the need to be flexible to move forward. From Buddhism, the idea of the "beginners mind" which asks its followers to come at problems as though you\'re encountering them for the very first time. \n\n\nIn addition to my exploration of Taoism, Buddhism, and later Stoicism, I\'m interested in Ethics. I read John Steward Mills Utilitarianism and Peter Singers Famine, Affluence and Morality but found that maximizing happiness sometimes lead one to uncomfortable moral decisions that I wasn\'t comfortable with. Again, I tend to be averse to dogmas. Stoicism appears to contain an inherit ethical worldview with its emphasis living simply, reducing want, and accepting fate as opposed to thrashing against it. It addition to this, there is a line from Marcus Aurelius that I\'ve meditated on several times. He said, "Men exist for the benefit of each other. Teach them or bear with them." I\'ve leaned heavily on this when I find myself frustrated with others.\n\n\nWhy the transition from Eastern philosophy to Western philosophy? I think as a younger, someone disenchanted man, I didn\'t hold much reverence for "our way of life." It came off as vapid and overly materialistic so when I went hunting for great thinkers, I gravitated towards the East for little more reason than it was something different. Still, I\'m glad I did because to this day, I hold many of the ideas and concepts dearly. When I read the Epictetus quote in my book on emotional intelligence, I was elated because I had finally found what I was searching for: A Western philosophy that focused on how to live and live simply. The Western part was important to me because I needed something more relatable and born of the tradition I was born into. Would I consider myself a Stoic? No. An aspirational Stoic? Absolutely. \n\n\nMy main goals for taking this course and hopefully the MA school in the future are simple. To learn more about Stoicism and Stoic thinkers. To learn more about the practical application of these ideas. To learn more about the ethics of Stoics. To ensure my understanding of Stoicism is wholly correct. And finally, to improve my life and the lives of those around me by living for the right reasons. With that, I hope you will consider my application and allow me to join in the study. Additionally, I have hopes of becoming a mentor though your program and to others. I\'m not certain if it\'s just the news, but it seems like more and more men are feeling disillusioned with this world and while I believe I pulled myself back from the precipice, I\'m afraid others won\'t be so lucky.\n', 1, '2018-09-12', 0, 0, 0, '', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', 1, 0, '', ''),

I am an agnostic that can\'t yet call himself an atheist. Jesus is still one of my favorite philosophers who professed love for your fellow man and to go out of your way to be loving and generous to the lowest of mankind. The fact that so many invoke his name only to spread hate is hypocritical a fact of many organized religions that I can\'t overlook. \n\nI once had a girlfriend named Mary who was on her own religious journey where she dragged me along to many a places looking for meaning. She settled on Buddhism for a while and I absorbed much through osmosis. We went to see the Dalai Lama when he came to town in Madison WI and it was powerful to see so many brought together under these ideals of being aware of yourself to make yourself better.  I liked the idea of meditation and mindfulness and I liked the idea of desire being the root of all suffering. On the other hand the supernatural aspects of it put me off from further pursuit.\n\nAfter my return, from the Pacific Ocean, to green fields of Wisconsin beside the inner sea that is lake Michigan I got work as for a large international bank. I worked to make the world worse for many people every day. The bank had acquired the rights to many defaulted loans and I was employed in checking the legal documents preparation for foreclosure. I was but a small cog in a machine but what I did was part and parcel to making the worst day of someones life. Every day the job would erode my soul, my eudaimonia. I needed to get out, had to get out. It was at this point I was pushed by Mary to apply for college full time. For this I am eternally grateful.  \n\nI went to college because I wanted to build to better the world, to atone for the work I had done in the opposite direction. I wound up with a CS degree from the University of Wisconsin but along the way wound up in a massive self improvement kick. I lost 50 pounds and started long distance running. I wanted to learn how to be a better me. I learned about the way we form our habits and how to use the visual centers of my mind to remember and retain information better. I was learning that if I was to contribute to the world I needed to first better know myself and control myself. To redirect my energy toward greater causes I knew that I had to work at it methodically and it would not be easy.\n\nOne night in the winter of 2016 while on an all nighter working on a program for Bioinformatics I took a break to read an article about Stoicism. Recently I had been listening to Tim Ferriss\' podcast and he had mentioned Stoicism a few times in it. For some reason it was stuck in my head and I needed something to take my mind off the program for the moment. The article was a guest blog by Ryan Holiday called Stoicism 101, and it just clicked. I devoured it and that consumption produced a seed of thought that would grow and not be dislodged. I had always wanted to learn more about  philosophy and that moment solidified a direction. \n\nNow that college is done I have time to learn the things I want to learn more that the things I needed to learn to feed my body. I have the wherewithal to devote my time and energy into feeding my mind and calming a lake of mental unease. \n\nOf the works of the Stoics, I have read Marcus Aurelius, some 90 of Seneca\'s Moral letters, two commentaries of Epictetus\' Enchiridion as well as the Enchiridion itself and some of his lectures as well. I am halfway through Stoicism and The Art of Happiness by Donald Robertson and I am actively looking for more recommendations. I have cursory knowledge of Epicureanism, Nietzsche\'s brand of existentialism, Cynicism, Buddhism and Christianity. If I could study it all I would. \n\nI consider myself a prokopton, imperfect but growing wiser every day. I try to remember those things that I have studied and internalize them. I keep a daily reflective journal and join other Stoics regularly to discuss readings and how to approach life in a Stoic way. When In the San Francisco Bay area I met weekly with the Startup Stoa in Fremont CA and currently I meet with the Milwaukee Stoic Meetup with Dr. Gregory Sadler once a month. \n\nOf the teachings I have found most useful is the idea that a thought is just a thought. I have been plagued for years by wandering thoughts of things I should have done or things I did that I wish I had done differently. The thoughts would pop into my head and have an immediate negative and audible response. Worse so, I would ruminate with them for some time after, distracting me from my task at hand. Now I can see them as just thoughts. They have no control over me and that they or but memories of the past that have no impact, besides lesions, on the person I am now and who I wish to become. I am not perfect, I am no sage, but I am progressing. \n\nNow I look for guides of those who have come before. I wish to build on the foundations I have already I wish to work with others hand in hand toward a better life down the Stoic road. A mentor and a community of people who look to improve themselves and others. To gain insight and clarification to the Stoic questions I have. I hope that I can find that and more from The College of Stoic Philosophers. \n', 1, '2018-09-22', 0, 0, 0, '', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', 1, 0, '', ''),

With the men of Weapons Company of the 1st Battalion of the 5th Marine Regiment surrounding him, he explained to us our battalion’s objectives, including the obstacles, land mines and enemy tanks and infantry we would encounter, and poignantly explained to us that we would have more power at our disposal than we could ever imagine.  Our infantry task force, Task Force Ripper, had a battalion of tanks, artillery, aircraft, and most impressive to us, a fleet of ships just offshore, including the battleship Missouri, ready to annihilate any perceived enemy standing in our way.  As he explained, one call on any radio from any one of us could unleash unimaginable destructive power.  As the immensity of this sank in, Captain Walsh paused for a moment before he continued.  His next statement would change my life forever, as he explained that every action we took from the moment we first came under fire, until the time the fighting ended would be our burden to bear for the rest of our lives. He admonished us to live with the sense of virtue the Marine Corps had cultivated in us from the first day of basic training.  With power comes responsibility, and our primary responsibility was to live virtuously, even in the face of our fears, and especially as we faced an unknown future.  This admonition to compassion, for both the men under his command, and the enemy we knew we faced, has become a paradigmatic moment for me.  As a 20-year old Lance Corporal in an Anti-armor assault platoon facing the fears and trauma of combat for the first time, these simple but profound words could not have been more welcome. \n\nTwo days later, under heavy artillery and mortar fire, my squad captured our first small group of five Iraqi soldiers.  After disarming them and ensuring they posed no threat, we held them at gun point as vehicles from behind the front lines came to collect our prisoners.  As the artillery fire drew closer, the Major I was guarding could see the tension in my face, and my grip tightening around my M-16A2 rifle.  In as calm a voice as he could muster, he asked me in nearly perfect English to lower my weapon.  Reflecting on Captain Walsh’s words, and knowing he posed no threat, I relented.  When the barrage had lifted somewhat, I asked him where he learned to speak English, and he told me that he had recently finished a graduate degree at the University of Michigan; under these incredibly trying circumstances, this enemy of mine and I connected as fellow humans.  \n\nAt the end of the fighting, I again recalled Captain Walsh’s words, knowing that my adherence and commitment to the virtues taught to me since my enlistment had pulled me through that experience, both physically, mentally and spiritually.  I came away from that experience profoundly changed in many ways.  My time in combat raised important questions about mortality, morality and what it took to live a eudaimonic life.   While Captain Walsh was, to my knowledge, not an explicit Stoic, his admonition to live by our innate and cultivated virtues has guided my life since then.  \n\nAbout a year after serving in the Gulf War I was discharged from the Marine Corps, and immediately enrolled in college. With a profound sense of gratitude simply to be alive, and with so many questions about how to live the good life with the second chance I was given, philosophy was a natural fit for me.  I threw myself into it wholeheartedly and found it incredibly gratifying.  In 2006 I completed my B.A in Philosophy with a concentration in Religious Studies.  I had unleashed my passion for learning, and carried that into graduate school where I earned both an M.A. and a Ph.D. in Peace Studies.  My graduate work primarily focused on indigenous strategies of peacemaking in the Pacific, particularly as they relate to conflicts over environmental degradation.  My doctoral work took me to the island of Bougainville, Papua New Guinea, where I studied the process of reconciliation after a 9-year civil war that took the lives of approximately 20% of the population. \n \nAfter being away from my home island of Maui, Hawai`i for nearly 15 years, upon finishing my studies I decided it was time to return home.  I was fortunate to find work in the field of ecological restoration and land conservation as the Director Conservation with the Hawaiian Islands Land Trust, a position I have now held for the past 14 years.  Although not academically trained as a restoration ecologist, I soon undertook another graduate degree in ecological restoration at the University of Idaho.  In 2016 I was accepted as a post-doctoral fellow with the Quaternary Palaeoecology Working Group at the University of Leicester in the United Kingdom.  My research consists of collecting field material at various sites in the Hawaiian Islands and conducting laboratory analysis on this material in England.  The goal of my research is to collect data on the structure, function and composition of Hawaiian ecosystems prior to human arrival (around 950 CE) in order to provide guidance to our ecological restoration work.  My particular focus seeks to discern ways that this palaecological data can enhance ecosystem resilience with the impending ecosystem disturbances we anticipate with climate change.  I have also found great pleasure in teaching, and currently teach a course on traditional Hawaiian cultural practices which foster and promote sustainability.  Although this is a short course taught through the continuing education program at the University of Hawai`i, it does look promising that I will be able to teach this as a whole semester course (I also taught both semester-long and intensive courses at three other Universities while in graduate school).  In October of 2016 I started a small (~4 acre) ‘ulu, or breadfruit, farm on Maui.  The farm has allowed me the opportunity to return to another passion of mine, working on the land.   \n\nHowever, since early 2016 my primary passion and interest has been Stoic philosophy.  While I was somewhat familiar with the basics of Stoic philosophy from my undergraduate courses in ancient philosophy, I did not grasp the true power of Stoicism at that time.  My more recent introduction came through watching several programs on Stoicism readily available to the public on Youtube, particularly the lectures by Massimo Pigliucci.  This introduction piqued my interest, and set me on a path to learn more about all aspects of Stoic philosophy.  I soon found A Guide to the Good Life: The Ancient Art of Stoic Joy by William Irvine.  From his writing I came to understand Stoicism both as a discipline and a practice, and certainly something I wished to pursue further.  I next purchased copies of the writings of Seneca, Epictetus and Marcus Aurelius and felt as though, through a gap of nearly 2,000 years, their thoughts were incredibly accessible and insightful, and spoke directly to me.  Their dedication to their community matched my passion for service to my community, both the human community and the land that I serve.  The writings of these Stoic authors both matched my own innate beliefs, and helped me to contextualize so much of my life.  I do not follow any particular faith, though I am interested in all faith traditions; however, I do consider myself a Stoic, or more precisely an aspiring Stoic, in the sense that I practice a number of disciplines espoused by both the ancient Stoics (particularly Seneca, Epictetus and Marcus Aurelius), and have been fascinated by the syncretic work of modern Stoic philosophers.  With regard to my belief in a divine power, my beliefs seem to most coherently align with the Stoic conception of the logos/pneuma, with a strong orientation towards pantheism/panentheism.  \n\nMy next readings included Massimo Pigliucci’s How to Be a Stoic, which I also found amazing in that it provided clarity on the disciplines necessary to achieve Stoic eudaimonia through the practice of arête.  Again, I felt as though this work spoke directly to me, and I have found it profoundly insightful. I am currently reading The Inner Citadel: The Meditations of Marcus Aurelius by Pierre Hadot.  While I am still in the early stages of reading this work, I am so far enjoying it immensely.  \n\nIn addition to these readings, each morning I begin my day by reading the Daily Stoic, an e-mail message distributed by Ryan Holiday.  Podcasts have also proven incredibly useful in furthering my study.  While there are many which address Stoic topics (including several critical of Stoicism which provide an important antithesis to the uncritical acceptance of Stoic philosophy). One podcast I have found particularly insightful is Chris Fisher’s Stoicism On Fire.  In many ways I feel as though I have a solid and thorough grasp of the basics of Stoic philosophy, practice and discipline.  At this point I am seeking an opportunity to delve more deeply into the cultivation of this incredibly important world view, and to find a community of those who share my passion for Stoicism, and a commitment to the virtues of wisdom, justice, moderation and courage.\n\nAs I have indicated above, I have found the practice and discipline of Stoicism incredibly rewarding.  Last July, after learning that it was possible to do so, I decided to donate my kidney to an anonymous recipient.  Although I had a certain degree of concern about this procedure (I had never had surgery in my life), once I had made the decision to make the donation, I substantially tamed my fears by reminding myself of the dichotomy of control: once the decision was made, what happened was outside my control, and lay within the power and control of the surgeon.  I had taken every step to assure the procedure went well by mentally and physically preparing myself, and the rest was up to the team to whom I had entrusted my life.  \n\nIn the two months since donating my kidney I have had a lot of time to reflect on how incredibly grateful I am to have lived such a fortunate life, my commitment to living a virtuous life of kindness and dedication to community, and the profound happiness such a choice brings.  A life that puts others, including the land, first has had profoundly positive impacts on me and, I hope, those around me.  With the ‘raw material’ derived from my personal studies of Stoic philosophy, I am now hoping to refine and elevate my practice, I am hoping that acceptance into this program will help me to advance my Stoic discipline, and, hopefully, one day I might be able to share my passion for Stoicism with others. \n \n', 1, '2019-02-05', 1, 0, 0, '', 0, '', 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', 1, 1, '2020-12-15', ''),

They were so tough that I was looking for a philosophical discipline that would serve as my “sail”. I realized that I couldn’t control the winds that blow. I tried to, but I ended up tired, beaten, and defeated. The winds are the things I don’t have control over like accidents, misfortunes, sickness, financial crash, or any undesirable events. However, I thought that I can use the wind for my own advantage, if I know how to set the sail.  The setting of the sail is philosophy. I perused Will Durant’s Story of Philosophy and I stumbled upon Stoicism as a philosophical thought.  From then on,  the search has become endless as a rabbit hole. My first formal introduction  to Stoicism is not a book on stoicism but a book that has stoicism in it. It  was Ryan Holiday’s Obstacle is the Way.  Albeit, not classified as a book on Stoicism, it was like a house haunted by the ghosts of Marcus Aurelius, Seneca and Epictetus.  In fact, the title of the book is a quote from Marcus Aurelius. This book also served as my springboard to dive into the ocean of materials which occupied my minds almost everyday. Some of them are Meditations (Marcus Aurelius), Letters of a Stoic (Seneca), Enchiridion (Epictetus)  and a Good Life (Cicero). I also have just started reading Tom Wolfe’s Man in Full, which is a novel based on the author’s interview with James Stockdale, a prisoner of war in Vietnam and a well known stoic. By the way, Tom Wolfe just passed away 3 days ago at the age of 88. My exposure to Stoicism is not confined in books alone. As I try to fortify my inner fort, I watch youtube videos like Serenity of Stoicism, the lectures of Massimo Pigliucci, Alain Bontaine  and countless videos of Tim Ferris.  I also listen to the podcasts of Chris Fisher, Drew Simon and Massimo Pigliucci. They are my driving buddies. Podcasts also serve as my sleeping lullaby. I started reading Pierre Hadot who is very much quoted by podcasters and writers. His book, the Inner Citadel is not an easy read for me but I found it very profound and practical at the same time. The thrust of the book is the application of traditional stoicism to modern life.  The idea that was born more than 2000 years ago is still very much applicable in our times, because it is based on fundamentals that do not change.  The emotion of happiness during the time of Marcus Aurelius is the same emotion we have today.\n	I have come from a  very strong theist tradition. I am religious, not to mention that I am a minister in a Christian denomination. But I have found that stoicism has no conflict with my religious beliefs. In fact they are complimentary. Some people have the wrong notions that old stoics believe in mythologies and so it would conflict with Christian beliefs. Not true. Yes, in their writings they mentioned the gods and goddesses of Romans and Greek mythologies because that’s the way their audiences would understand their messages. Hence, there is no conflict between Christianity and Stoicism. The truth is many historians supposed that Christianity was heavily influenced by Stoicism which is evidential in Christian monasticism and ascetism. It is said that Apostle Paul had communications with stoics during his time. This could be true because Seneca and Apostle Paul were contemporaries and the latter also set foot in Rome, but there is no clear evidence to such claim. \n	I have been a church minister for 30 years and I have seen the beauty and ugliness of religions. What was lost in most religion is is the flagship of Stoicism which is virtue. C.S. Lewis said that of all the bad people, bad people in religion are the worst. In a documentary program, which is called London Real, Ryan Holiday said that religion could be replaced with Stoicism. While I don’t completely agree with him, he has a point in saying that because Stoics are more virtuous than most religious leaders today. Nevertheless, we should not throw the baby out with the bathwater. Religion and Stoicism have their own places but they should share the same virtues. After all, both recognize the same Supreme Being.\n	One of the highlights in Stoicism, which is not well explained in the realms of religion is the belief that that there are things that are up to us and there are things that are not up to us. In Stoicism, it is called the dichotomy of control. While there are some clues in Christian homilies regarding this issue, it is not well expounded. The closest we can get in Christian religion is the word surrender or relinquishment. As I have said above, they are not in conflict. Rather, stoic ideas can be supplemental to Christian dogma. I have surveyed many philosophical thoughts. I read Spinoza, Voltaire, Kierkegaard, Nietczhe and many more to mention.  The ideas are interrelated and intellectually stimulating but none of them resonates in my heart. I dabbled on the spiritual teachings Eckart Tolle. I found his teachings too eastern for me. Although I am Asian, I am more westernized in my line of thinking.\n	I do not consider myself as a stoic yet, let alone a philosopher and will never be a sage. I am a student for life. I may not be able to reach perfection but I can always try my best to be aware as much as possible. Maybe someday, even if I won’t be considered as a stoic philosopher, at least, I can be a man who lives in a stoic philosophy.\n	My purpose in taking this course is somewhat selfish. I want to fortify my inner citadel. I found myself very vulnerable. If I were a target, darts always landed bulls eye, right on my heart. Sometimes problems are crippling me. I suffered from depression and sometimes self medicate with drinking.  I attribute this to  my inability to recognize that there are things that I have control and there are things that I don’t have over at all. Maybe I know, but I my inner citadel is not strong enough.\n', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, '', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', 1, 0, '', ''),

It’s a very engaging blog because the author shares his points of view and how he lives his life steering away from mindless consumerism by desiring less and thinking of alternatives (bike or feet instead of car), taking time to appreciate the simple things (like being a full-time human encyclopaedia to his son when they’re out playing in the nature and learning more about equal shared parenting so both parents can find a better balance sharing the duties and joys of raising a kid) and also about being bold enough to live a life that the society will criticise for being different and stepping away of the status quo but you know that’s the right thing to do and so it’s worth the effort and you shouldn’t care.\nHis blog had a post about an e-mail from a reader saying that the content of the blog related a lot to Stoicism and recommended that the author picked up \'A Guide to the Good Life’ by William B. Irvine. I was really fond of the blog so if that philosophy would help bring that whole mindset that I already liked to my entire life, then it would be great. Less anxiety and stress by living a simpler life, I was sold. As soon as I finished the article I got a digital copy of the book to learn more about that. At the time I was reading multiple books at the same time as is generally the case and was also in college and working full-time so I didn’t make it my priority. I remember started reading the book and liking the content, even trying some practical ideas, like cold showers for voluntary discomfort, but some of the concepts scared me a little. I didn’t feel as courageous to step away from comfort and pleasure and resisted facing self-control challenges.\nRecently I’ve worked on clarifying my priorities in life. There are a thousand and one things that I want to do and a limited amount of time. Plus, I feel the need to give more attention to issues like stress and anxiety and giving myself more leeway to breathe and relax, less busyness. So I did a reality-check with myself. I’ve had some interesting conclusions: I value peace of mind over money - that means no sum will make me agree to been on call 24/7 and waking up in the middle of the night because the servers are down, I’ll have to learn how to desire and live with less; I am not my job - as much as I enjoy working as a software engineer, there’s more to life than it. This realisation made me see how it doesn’t make sense for me to pursue being recognised as brilliant in my field by sitting in front of the computer during my free time to improve my skills and always maintain a side project rolling while my body and mind are begging for some rest and there is an entire world out there that I’ve been neglecting. Also I’ve just moved from Brazil to the Netherlands (moving out of Brazil was a plan that I\'ve had for at least ten years) and here I have a number of things to explore and do to adapt to a new country and culture, build my social circle and here I have more freedom to live my life in the way that I want, so it’s up to me to decide how this life looks like.\nThese realisations made me remember Stoicism and I felt that it could be the glue that would stick things together and could give me a clear purpose, a guideline through which base my choices. That’s why I decided this was the moment to give it my full effort. Right now Stoicism is my focus along with health (physical, mental and emotional).\n\nSome books on Stoic philosophy I’ve read: the Enchiridion, Meditations (in progress), A Guide to the Good Life and How to be a Stoic by Massimo Pigliucci. I really like the Enchiridion and I’ve read/listened to it around four times now and I think I will do it many times more. I’m really enjoying Meditations, I have to keep myself from highlighting the whole book. When I read it I know that that is the life that I want for me because those lines ring true to my heart.\n\nI consider myself a deist. I’ve found out about Spiritism (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiritism) when I was twelve by reading the textbooks from the course my godparents were attending. They never told me to read it, I was simply curious, went for it, saw that it made sense to me and kept on reading. It has always suited me well and answered my questions. I see God as a creative force and I see it in nature. I think we’re too small to be able to comprehend it fully and I’m fine with that. There was a point when I realised that somethings I’ll only find out when I die and I should concern myself with what I can do with the life in front of me. It’s very freeing to be fine with not knowing for sure what’s going to happen. I wish I could extend that to other areas of my life.\nAs for the other questions described:\nI haven’t studied different philosophies more than superficially.\nI consider myself a Stoic novice. I’m bringing more of its practice to my daily life and applying it to my thoughts and decisions. Currently I’m setting up a Stoic community in my area. It will be the first one of the country and I’ll be happy to meet similar minded people to discuss the practice of Stoicism.\nWith this course I’d like to receive guidance on my development as a Stoic and also use it as accountability to keep me on track and maintain my focus.', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, '', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', 1, 0, '', '');

By the same token, there is nothing that brings me more joy than exploring the important questions and looking beneath the surface.\n\nI grew up in the San Francisco Bay Area in a large and dysfunctional family. As is the case for too many of us, my childhood was very difficult. I was diagnosed with OCD, tourettes syndrome, and a variety of other mental health disorders when I was young. I was heavily medicated for all my childhood and spent the majority of my time alone. I just never fit in with my peers or family, so I blocked out reality and retreated to my head. It was a painful time.\n\nWhen I entered adulthood, I was anything but ready to go out into the world. So I became self-destructive as a means of not facing reality. The years between 18-24 were spent bouncing from place to place, searching for hope. I became morbidly obese and sought out every numbing mechanism possible including drugs, alcohol, junk food, cigarettes, and more. I didn’t know that happiness was possible. I had never known it.\n\nI was broken.\n\nOver the course of several years, I began to heal. I dropped my crutches one by one. I stopped taking the unnecessary prescription drugs so I could fully feel my emotions. While this was difficult, I was eventually able to stop using drugs and alcohol. I then let go of eating junk food, and lost 60 pounds. Next I quit cigarettes cold turkey, going from a pack a day to none at all.\n\nEventually I discovered meditation and began to inspect my thoughts. Realizing how broken I truly was, I entered the hospital for more serious help. I spent half a year in treatment for PTSD, diving back into my memories to bring them to the surface. Only then, I was told, would my life start to fall into place. I left treatment and collapsed a month later. I entered another period of intense suffering, but I hadn’t lost the progress I’d made. My old habits remained in the past, and I continued persevering. Then, at the end of 2017, something shifted. I had suffered enough. I entered treatment again, and for the last time. My journey was just beginning.\n\nHere I am today, having made incredible progress in the previous 6 months. After three prior attempts at college, I took matters into my own hands and began educating myself. Books, online courses, tutorials. Tapping deeper into my intuition, I began to climb out of hell.\n\nI now work as a content marketer for an online startup, and I own a web design studio. I am coming into my own and discovering my abilities. My primary gift lies in my sensitivity. I feel everything very intensely, which I now understand to be a blessing and a curse. I am extraordinarily aware of my own thoughts, processes, and even unconscious. This emotional depth combined with my ability to reason is a powerful combination. I’m learning to hone it.\n\nI am also profoundly intuitive. I just get things, a result of my finely-tuned nervous system. However, this means I pick up on all sorts of stimuli, and I have a hard time filtering things out. This leads to easy overarousal. I’m beginning to understand how to work with this part of me. As with most things, balance is key.\n\nSo far, I’ve been quick to mention my strengths. But I also need to identify my weaknesses. I am prone to submissive behavior in my interactions with others, though that is changing as my confidence grows. I don’t fully believe in my abilities, but that too is changing. I still suffer from crippling social anxiety. While this is getting better, it’s still a large part of my current existence. Additionally, my survival strategy growing up was to play the victim. I am still working to change my perspective from victim to survivor.\n\nWhile I can’t change my initial thoughts or feelings, I’m learning that I can absolutely change the way I perceive and respond to those thoughts and feelings. I don’t have to react the same way as I used to. The habits of yesterday don’t have to define today.\n\nI no longer want to view myself as a victim of my circumstances. I am competent, capable, and in control. I am responsible, and I believe stoicism will help me better manage my self and my relationship with the world. This is important if I’m ever going to achieve my potential and fully individuate.\n\nI first heard about stoicism during a conversation with a philosopher friend of mine. I was intrigued by the ideas he was mentioning so I began reading some foundational texts, including a number of excerpts from Seneca. My searches ultimately led me to the College of Stoic Philosophers.\n\nWhat excites me most about stoicism is the principle of aligning with reality. I continue to come back to this idea in my own journals. Using mindfulness, reason, and an awareness of ethical behavior, I know I can accomplish great things. That said, I don’t believe I currently have enough knowledge to consider myself a stoic. A philosopher, certainly. But not a stoic. I’d like to change that.\n\nWhen it comes to life’s big question, I consider myself an agnostic with no ties to any particular faith. I think of life and nature as the great creator and creation. Here too, the concept of balance plays an important role in my understand of the world. But I want to know more.\n\nThe College of Stoic Philosophers seems to offer everything I’m looking for. In addition to what looks like a great curriculum, it provides structure and community. I’m learning that both of these things are vital to my success in life.\n\nI am eager to begin the process of study and practice under the mentorship of someone who has already gone through the course. Ultimately, I hope to find ways to contribute to the college after I’ve finished the Marcus Aurelius School. I want to be part of something bigger than myself so I can better contribute my gifts to the world. I’m optimistic I’ll find that opportunity here.', 1, '2019-01-03', 0, 0, 0, '', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', 1, 0, '', ''),

Feel free to call or email me with any further questions. Thank you for your consideration.', 'Know Thyself Essay\nI was born January 1st, 1974. I am originally from Springfield, Illinois. I attended Catholic school up until my sophomore year of high school, then two years of public school and graduated. Immediately after high school, I entered the Air Force as an SP (security police). When I got out of the Air Force I went to college, first at a local community college, then ultimately to Northern Illinois University. \n	In 2001 I decided to go to work full-time because I had to pay my own way and therefore didn’t finish my bachelor’s degree at that time. After 9/11 happened, I reenlisted in the Army National Guard as an MP (military police). During this same period, I worked as a retail manager and then as an asset protection manager (loss prevention). \n	I didn’t find retail to be particularly fulfilling and my girlfriend at the time suggested that I apply at the local library because she said that I seemed like someone who would work at a library. I was lucky enough to be hired and promoted from within on two occasions. I am currently the Assistant Manager of Digital Services at Aurora Public Library and I’ve worked for this library in one capacity or another for the last 11 years. \n	I have been married for three and a half years and my wife and I have a four-month-old daughter named Freya Elizabeth Sloan.  She is wonderful, even though at age 44, I’m finding that 4-5 hours of sleep per night is much more challenging than it was when I was in my twenties.  I am also enrolled in Northern Illinois University again after a long layoff, and only two math classes from completing my bachelor’s degree. It has been a long time coming. \nThat pretty much brings you up to speed on my history, but it doesn’t tell you anything about why I want to take the SES course.  I have always loved learning, formally and informally. My first love was biology, birds (ornithology) specifically. Then I took a philosophy course and I was hooked.  Ultimately though, I felt like philosophy in the university setting was more about convoluted logic puzzles and less about how to live a good life, which is where my interest was at.  Because of this, I slowly found my way into some psychology courses and continue to be interested in that field. \nMy plan is ultimately to pursue an advanced degree in psychology, hopefully with a focus on studying what creates mental toughness in an individual (especially athletes but not limited to them) or what I hear referred to a lot today as “grit.” I never stopped loving philosophy, I just fell out of love with the idea of arguing for argument’s sake. I have always had a strong interest in Buddhism and Stoicism since I was in my teens. I feel like they have a lot in common. I guess the reasons I’m drawn more to Stoicism is firstly, it’s less esoteric. I could be wrong about that but it seems like it’s less of a translation of a translation of a translation, than what I commonly find in books about what the Buddha taught. I also like the engagement with society that seems to be a natural part of Stoicism. It’s unlikely that I will become a forest monk, which often seems to be the stereotypical image of the wise Buddhist who has made it, completely disengaged from the modern world.  In Stoicism, especially after listening to some recent podcasts, I’m seeing that while these two philosophies have things in common, there are also some drastic differences. \nAs far as what books I’ve read on Stoicism, I read the Enchiridion back in around 2001 when I was in college for the first time, and Meditations. Other than that what I read was more general philosophy or books by Carl Sagan when I was in a science mood.  \nAs far as what I would call myself, personally I’d prefer not to call myself anything because it seems like as I age and learn, I always end up in a slightly different spot. I’ve gone from being a Christian when I was young, like most Westerners, to being an atheist. Then to being an agnostic, to being a sort of Buddhist who didn’t subscribe to the metaphysics. Now I would describe myself as someone with a serious interest in Stoicism, but not completely educated on what that means in terms of a belief in a higher power. The Stoic on Fire podcast has been helping me dive a little deeper and understand some these things.  \nAs mentioned, I’m not currently a member of any religious faith but as a 44 year old man and a new father, I do wrestle with how to set an example for my daughter and what I should and should not teach her about God/gods and how to live a good life in this world.  \nI’ve taken college survey courses in philosophy so I’ve touched on all the big ones, but I wouldn’t say I’m well educated in them.  My beliefs, the arguments that I’ve found most convincing, tend toward atheism, Buddhism, and Stoicism, depending on the point in my life you met me. Those are the three areas where I actually own books and study them outside of a traditional college setting.\nDo I consider myself to be a Stoic? I would have to say, no. Do I aspire to be a Stoic? Yes, I think I do. I need to learn more and educate myself on what that means, but I know enough to understand that it appeals to me, seems workable and accurate, and I’m not yet to the point where I live the teachings. I should say that what re-lit my fire for philosophy and specifically Stoicism, was hearing someone talk about a philosophy whose purpose was to be lived and practiced. I’m the kind of person who only sees a use in a philosophy that can be lived. I’m not the kind of philosophy student who enjoys the heat of the argument that much. I just want to understand the facts and what is right, and then get about trying to live it and see if it works. \nI hope you will consider allowing me to enroll. This isn’t the type of program that I expect will help me get a great job in the sense that I can put it on a resume. But I feel like it might be the type of apprenticeship that could lead to a life that is internally consistent and fulfilling, which is far more valuable than a checkbox for the next resume.   \n\nThank you for your consideration,\nMark J.

I now live for 4 years in Tel-Aviv.\n\nI am also Jewish by my culture/religion (it is difficult to separate them religion and culture, in Judaism) but my view is more atheistic; I  am comfortable identifying God with Nature (which makes me more a Pantheist I guess).\n\nI passed the baccalauréat, and studied pharmacology and then accounting but I was not interested by neither of them. I stopped my studies in the middle and I haven’t gotten a degree.\nWhile I was studying I started to do magic shows. Magic, balloon sculptures and software development was my main hobbies.\n\nWhen I moved to Israel I did a course to be computer technician and got a professional certificate.\nSince I did many courses and got certification in:\n- software development (Javascript, Java, HTML, HTML5, C, C++, Unix, PHP, SQL, …)\n- life coaching, Marketing (social marketing, SEO and marketing in general)\n- Neuro-Linguistic Programming (Provisional NLP Live Master Practitioner, NLP Live Practitioner)\n- Marketing (SEO, Social Network, and general marketing)\n\nSince 1996, I work as software developer. I worked mostly on unix system and I have done project to improve computer security or using artificial intelligence. The most interesting project I have done was to detect human emotions using the voice.\nSince 2004, I work as freelance, mostly with the same companies I worked with before.\n \nIn 2011-2012 I studied to become a life coach I have been coaching since though I have not made it my main profession.\n\nMy first approach with philosophy was on my last high school year. The course concentrated mostly on Immanuel Kant. I didn’t found any interest in Philosophy then. Especially since many of the subjects introduced in class could have been solved doing simple experiments.  \n\nI came to stoicism thanks to a medical problem.\nUntil 2010, I was interested to make money, become rich and start living later… when I’ll be old (After reading Seneca, I understand how foolish this is). \nIn 2010, I got sick. What started with pain in the eyes, turned to be something more serious. The neurologist fist suggested I have Multiple Sclerosis. Later it appear I have an autoimmune disease that causes similar damage called Antiphospholipid Syndrome. My first reaction was to enter in a kind of depression and for three months I spent my time in bed, watching funny movies.\nAfter three months, my view of life changed, and what became important to me was the present moment… and doing the best I can at each moment.\nThanks to the psychologist who followed me during that period, I discovered mindfulness and I started to meditate; and later I took a course on mindfulness.\n\nMindfulness helped me being happier and it helped me live difficult moments. Still there is a few elements that didn’t match between my personality and mindfulness:\n- mindfulness goals are very abstract and even esoteric\n- in mindfulness practices, one is turned toward himself only\n- mindfulness doesn’t set a goal in life, a goal for life\n\nI discovered stoicism in 2015, through the book  "The guide to a good life: The Art of ancient Stoic" (William B. Irvine") and immediately I found it is my way.\nSince I am doing my best to follow the stoicism, to follow its principles and to improve myself everyday. \nI am doing a morning meditation every morning, and evening meditation. I am adding other practice depending on the obstacles I encounter during the day and the time I can find to meditate.\nMy favorite practices are:\n- pause and breath\n- reminding myself of the impermanence of things\n- examine my impressions\n- take another perspective\n- the view from above\n- how obstacle are opportunities to use the virtues and improve my strength of character\n- voluntary discomfort\n- imagine that everything I like as borrowed from fortune\n- buy tranquility\n- gratitude to others\n- negative visualization\n\nStoicism has brought me a lot in my life. It brought.\n- more happiness that I have ever known\n- a way to set goals, without worrying of the outcome\n- a way to improve myself\n- a way not to worry (thought mindfulness brought that to me too)\n- a way to keep my calm and tranquility\n- a frame to make decisions\n\nI consider myself a stoic.\n\nThese is the list of books on stoicism I read:\n- The guide to a good life: The Art of ancient Stoic" (William B. Irvine)\n- Meditations (Marcus Aureilius)\n- A Better Human (George J. Bradley)\n- The Enchiridion (Epictetus)\n- The Golden saying of Epictetus\n- Everything has two handles (Ronald Pies)\n- How to be a stoic (Massimo Pigliucci)\n- Stoicism (John Sellars)\n- Stoicism - Ultimate handbook to stoic philosophy (Thomas Beckett)\n- The obstacle is the way (Ryan Holiday)\n- Unshakable Freedom - Ancient Stoic Secrets (Chuck Chakrapani)\n- Dying Every Day (James Romm)\n- Stoicism – A Quickstart Guide to the Ancient philosophy of Stoicism (Jordan Jacobs)\n- On Shortness of life (Seneca)\n- Stoic Spiritual Exercises (Elen Buzare)\n- Stoicism (John Sellar)\nI also did online the Stoic Week in 2017.\n\nSince I have been interested to stoicism I have read about Epicureanism and also got interested about positive psychology. Between Stoicism, Epicureanism, Mindfulness and Positive psychology I get an handle on the main approaches to happiness I have heard of.\n\nThe other philosophical books I read are\n- on General Semantics: “Science and Sanity” (Alfred Korzybski), “To be or not: an E-Prime Anthology” (David Bourland), “General Semantics: An Outline Survey” (Kenneth G. Johnson)\n- on Socrates: “Socrates’ Way” (Ronald Gross).\n- On Epicureanism: “Epicureanism” (O’Keefe), “The Art of Happiness” (Epicurus), “Travel with Epicurus” (David Klein)\n\nI am looking in that course to deeper my understanding of stoicism and to exchange views with others who share the same interest.

Kind regards.', 'Meraz Ahmed, Admission Essay for SES, meraz@btopenworld.com			July 13, 2018\r\n\r\nI live in St Albans which is a historic Roman city, just north of London in the UK.  I live with my wife and my two daughters 12, and 18, and have two older children, boys 21 and 23 who work and study away from home.  I work in my own small clinic as an Osteopath, which is a manual therapist specialising in correcting spinal and joint problems.  My wife is my practice manager and deals with patient bookings and enquiries.  I have previously worked as a Management Consultant in London and graduated initially in engineering before retraining.  In my spare time, I practice and occasionally teach Taijiquan and Qigong.\r\n\r\nI was born in Dacca on 31 Oct 1967, in the capital of what was then East Pakistan but later became the independent country of Bangladesh.  In 1968 East and West Pakistan began to prepare for civil war and my family came as refugees to England leaving all of our property and most of our possessions in West Pakistan where we had been living and my father working as a College Lecturer.  My father had a sister who lived in London and we were able to stay with her family while my father found employment as a Civil Servant.  \r\n\r\nMy parents were both from large families and had traumatic childhoods.  Their fathers both died when they were quite young, 4 for my father and 10 for my mother.  My father had won an academic scholarship at the age of 14 and came to the UK with a small group of scholars in 1951 to study Marine Engineering.  As he had British qualifications, he was later able to apply and join the British civil service.  My mother married him at 16 when he was 26, as was the custom then.  She was relatively poorly educated.  But in England learned English and brought up my older brother and I, and worked part-time as a sales assistant while doing so.\r\n\r\nI was one years old when we came to England and have no memory of living abroad.  My parents decided to speak only in English when we were established as UK citizens so I don’t speak Bengali very well.  There were not many Bangladeshis in London when I was growing up, and as we had little contact with extended family in Bangladesh, I grew up with a feeling of disconnection with my country of birth.  I have always felt at home in England, although conscious of not quite fitting in.  This has led to some serious cultural and religious clashes with my parents as I have not felt part of the ethnic Bengali culture nor the Islamic religious faith.\r\n\r\nI went to a good private school in London and went on to Imperial College to study engineering.  My father was very successful academically and was quite controlling, stressed and hard to please.  He had many relatives and dependents who he supported financially back in Bangladesh in addition to bringing us up, and life was a serious business for him.  I felt I had little input into my choice of course and university.  My older brother had left home acrimoniously and at university I rebelled from the controlling environment at home and moved away in my second year.  I met my wife at university.  She was from an ethnic Chinese background although born in London.  Neither of our families approved of our relationship and we graduated together and eventually moved away to live together without any contact with our families for about 3 years.  We decided to get married and made peace overtures to our respective families when my wife had our first son.  We have maintained a reasonable if not warm relationship with them since, and have now been married for 26 years.\r\n\r\nI would describe myself as a ‘seeker after truth’.  I was initially interested in metaphysics, reading Jung at school and reading all the books on new age mysticism and spirituality in the school library.  I have never felt attracted to either the Islam of my family nor the Christianity of my school chaplain.  Having watched the tv programme “Kung Fu’ as a child, I developed a deep interest in martial arts and buddhism, and later Daoism.  I have learned and practiced various martial arts including Taijiquan to instructor level and have read and attended many workshops on Buddhism, particularly Zen, and Daoism.\r\n\r\nI discovered Stoicism about 8 years ago having picked up on some similarities between Daoism and Stoicism, but my studies did not get far at that time.  About 4 years ago my father died and during his final stages, I found myself having panic attacks which I could not understand or properly explain.  These subsided but returned out of the blue a year and a half ago, and I felt debilitated by them and felt the stress of life getting on top of me.  As part of looking for some help I looked into CBT which again led me back to Stoicism.  \r\n\r\nIn Stoicism I found a number of resources and ideas which I found helped me cope with my anxiety and gradually led me deeper into a desire to study Ancient Philosophy in general, and Stoic Philosophy in particular.\r\n\r\nLast autumn in 2017, I participated in the Stoic Week organised by Modern Stoicism.  I also completed the home study course in the book ‘Stoic Serenity’ by Keith Seddon as part of which there were guided readings of Marcus Aurelius’ Meditations, and Seneca’s letters.  Other Stoic philosophy books which I have read or listened to include:\r\n\r\n‘Guide to the Good Life’, by William Irvine, audiobook,\r\n‘The Good Life Handbook / Enchiridion’ by Chuck Chakrapani,\r\n‘The Complete Works of Musonius Rufus’ by Chuck Chakrapani,\r\n‘A Fortunate Storm’ by Chuck Chakrapani,\r\n‘Stoic Inspirations’ by Chuck Chakrapani,\r\n‘How to be a Stoic’ by Massimo Pugliucci,\r\n‘What is Ancient Philosophy’ by Philip Hadot\r\n‘The Daily Stoic’ by Ryan Holiday\r\n\r\nI would as a younger person have described myself as an atheist, and then as a Daoist, but I now see myself as a Secular Stoic.  I am an atheist in the sense of the Abrahamic or other revealed religions, but am agnostic to the Pantheism that I have encountered in Stoicism.  \r\n\r\nI was very surprised by the practical nature of Stoic philosophy and have felt the profound benefit of applying it in my life.  I have also seen the positive effects on my interactions with others. I continue to read some Stoic Philosophy every morning, try to practice Stoicism during the day and mentally review my day as suggested by Seneca when going to bed.  To help me and others practice, I have started a small meet up group for Stoic Philosophy in St Albans.  There are only 3 active members meeting monthly at present.  I am applying to enrol in the School of  Essential Studies as I hope to deepen my understanding and practice of Stoicism in a tradition of formal learning.  The more I learn about Stoic Philosophy, the more I realise that there is to learn and the more work there is to do on myself.\r\n\r\nI look forward to the next stage of enrolment, fate willing.\r\n', 1, '2019-02-19', 0, 0, 0, '', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 'Interdum et malesuada fames ac ante ipsum primis in faucibus.

This was two months in the making and I was trying to be ready. They read off my mistakes, not following standard operating procedure, I showed up a minute late to a meeting, and that time 7 years ago when I apparently broke some other arbitrary and petty rule.  The nine different glowing progress reports were not brought up, neither was the company newsletter I started, the new database I started or the two page letter of reference Gwen, unbeknownst to me, sent to my supervisor. They told me to turn in my ID and that I would not be able to give out any information to outside sources. I would have to set up a meeting with the HR lady, the wife of the guy firing me.\n	I never really liked that job. Although working for TSA was a safe job, it was also it was also completely soul crushing. Telling people to take off their shoes and then looking in their bags leads to constant resentment and a slow draining of your faith in humanity. The urge to quit was constant and ranged from a dull ache to something like watching a nuclear bomb slowing falling from the sky. For probably three weeks about 6 years into my stint at the airport, every day me and Alex would great each other with, “Still haven’t quit yet huh?” I realize now that the longer I stayed the more likely I was to never quit. The more “motivational” phrases I heard that were really just code for, shut up and do what we say, the more I was forgetting what it was like to be creative and honest and caring. I would go to appointments outside of work to different offices and think why isn’t everyone yelling? \n	One time after work, while still in uniform, someone literally pointed and laughed at me at a gas station. It was instinctual because with his arm stretched out he seemed to shake his head, as if clearing it, and then lowered his arm and quickly turned and walked away. TSA is met with the professional equivalent at job interviews: sneers and arrogant laughs. There’s also not much carry over for experience in security outside of security jobs. I couldn’t go back to security. I was freed, although the path led though purgatory, and I was not going back. I learned quickly that for a new job I would need new training. But this was not easy to come. If I would have enrolled in any type of schooling or training while, I could have been ruled ineligible for unemployment benefits. (Under Kansas rules.) So colleges and universities were not an option. I checked out a program at a local workforce center and found that there were programs available but it was dependent on employers. I called up a few bricklayers and pipe fitters and found that there was no work. Jobs in Wichita, KS were drying up. I applied for a job as a cashier at a local grocery store and was told that they had 220 people apply for the position. Fortunately my wife had a good job and most of the time we were just able to pay the bills. There were a few months when we had to use credit cards. \n	“Freaking Obama,” my dad said.\n	“What?” I asked as I arched my back against the couch. \n	My dad sighed. “I really believe that he’s the worst President in history.”\n	“How so?” I asked. A few beads of sweat now slid down my back. Why do they keep it so warm in here, I thought.\n	“He’s pandering. He’s buying votes. Obamacare, Medicare, Social security it is all just a way to buy people’s votes.”\n	I didn’t reply.\n	“It’s not so bad,” he said. “When you were growing up we didn’t have a lot but we got along. People who aren’t making enough just need to cut back.”\n	“On what?” I asked.\n	After a pause he said, “cell phones” \n	Silence. \n	“We got a new pastor at the church,” my mom said.\n	“Oh, how is he?” I asked.\n	“Good. He is from Iowa, your dad thinks he is more ambitious then genuinely caring but everyone seems to like him. Your dad calls him the football coach. We had our first usher’s meeting last week. He isn’t moving into the pastoral house though. He wants to live in Wichita.”\n	“What happened to Pastor Terry?” I asked.\n	“He tried to commit suicide.”\n\n	I can still remember the anxiety I felt right before I went forward in church when I was about 12 years old. I had even told the pastor. But as I walked down the middle aisle as the choir sang onstage and people in the pews waited to be dismissed, the pastor stood there with his eyes closed. I stood right next to him and even nudged his arm. He still had his eyes closed until an usher ran up to him and shook him. Into the microphone he said that he was praying for someone to come forward. But he looked like he was asleep on his feet. \n	From that moment I was an official member of First Baptist Church in Augusta Kansas, and still am. I would attend preschool and an outing or two. They tried to get me to join some group that resembled boy scouts but after they said I wouldn’t get a knife until after three weeks, I left. I would attend church and Sunday school every day until I was 16. I was decked out in my tan slacks and polo shirt when I saw a family friend who was a few years older then me grab his girlfriend and walk out the back. Wow, I thought. It had never occurred to me that I could just leave. Wouldn’t my mom find out? But I left too. I drove my light blue truck around the lake a few times and returned home after enough time. I would still go to church but not as often. And once I got a job where I worked early mornings on Sundays, I stopped going altogether. I am still a Christian but I am questioning and I am certainly no evangelical. \n	A few months into my unemployment I started listening to a podcast of philosophy: Philosophize This. I was immediately drawn to it. It was for beginners and discussed philosophy in a chronological order. The episodes on ancient philosophy were my favorite. I would listen to them over and over, everything from the Pre-Socratics to Aristotle. Kant, Mill, Rawls and Peter Singer were the others with really resonated with me. My curiosity increased as I read different introductory books from my library. Utilitarianism is very interesting to me but I find myself going back to Stoicism. Reading Epicurious as I received rejection emails from job opportunities really calmed me. The understating that I was in control of just my actions and thoughts allowed me to leave behind trying to force a job to materialize. Since then I have read some Marx but find him a little too angry for me. I have read other political philosophy but just intro material. I have read Seneca and Aurelius but find that Epictetus burns inside me. I consider myself to be a Christian Stoic, if there is such a thing. I am not sure what I want to get out of this class, maybe just understanding. \n', 1, '2019-04-17', 0, 0, 0, '', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', 0, 0, '', ''),

How long you have been interested in Stoicism.\nI have been interested in Stoicism for approximately a year to a year and a half. I don’t remember how I stumbled across it, probably YouTube, but once I started to learn more about Stoicism it made a lot of practical sense and seemed to fill the spiritual void that religion typically does. I’ve been going back and forth for at least half this time on whether or not I should bite the bullet and apply for SES. \n\n2.	Any books you read on Stoic philosophy. If any, please list them.\nMeditations (audio book and book), Letters From A Stoic, Enchiridion, Courage Under Fire: Testing Epictetus\'s Doctrines in a Laboratory of Human Behavior by James Stockdale and I’m intermittently reading The Inner Citadel.\n\nIn addition to this website, I have also subscribed to the Daily Stoic, listened to a couple TED talks on Stoicism, and Brian Johnsons (Philosopher’s Notes/Optimize Me) YouTube channel, which has had some content on Stoicism. \n\n3.	Would you call yourself an atheist, agnostic/skeptic, deist, theist?\nI would say that I am someone in the agnostic/skeptic category, but at various points in time a self-proclaimed atheist. I would like to believe there is something greater at work, but some of the ideas out there just aren’t rational and/or are lacking any real evidence. Specifically, with Christianity I would need unarguable evidence to change my position and not what an old book written by people who were not even around when the events happened says. The Bible has become so distorted over time and the content has been cherry picked since its compilation. So, hardly the word or work of god if it ever was so. \nScientists write books on events/things that they weren’t present for (the Big Bang, dinosaurs, etc.), but I would say most do so in a manner where they look at all of the facts or as many as they can to either support or disprove their theory. They have a process to do this and others in their specific field to bounce ideas off of, or completely debunk their theories. One important item that has drawn me to Stoicism is that it is practical and testable. The fact that Stoicism has influenced Cognitive Behavioral Therapy is a sign that it is relevant and beneficial in the modern age.\n\n4.	Are you a member of a religious faith? If so, which and for how long?\nWhen I was young, my family and I went to a Lutheran church but as the years went by (probably 11 – 12 years) we stopped going. Just like with a lot of things, your life is influenced by the era and location in which you grew up, and the people around you. I have no doubt that if I had been born in another country that I would be speaking the language in which I was born, practicing the religion in which my parents or relatives practiced, and have my view of the world distorted by everything in between. \nI believe that most religions have some good universal ideas, ethics, and practices that if followed would help people, such as the golden rule, but to add in blind faith in a deity that supposedly created the world solely for humans to have dominion over AND in seven days/nights is a narcissistic belief and absurd. In theory, believing in Jesus can give you a blank check on heaven even if you’ve influenced or have done great evils. I cannot believe in something like that.\n\n5.	Have you studied philosophies other than Stoicism? If so, which?\nBuddhism (as a philosophy) but very loosely. I feel it is one of the closest philosophies to stoicism as it focuses more on the individual and not a supernatural power to work out problems. I think part of the draw, embarrassingly enough, is this movie image of a person that attains enlightenment and a glowing aura surrounds them, or that they know all and see all in one instance of clarity after they have completed a quest or harsh trial. They show the end results without showing the realistic aspects, and hard mental and physical work that can go into a committed Buddhist lifestyle. In addition, my wife’s father is Buddhist and goes to Temple quite often. He pays his respects to his family, lights incense, says a prayer, gets “blessed” by the monks, and goes about his day. I have done the same with my wife and kid. I have come to the conclusion that Buddhism overall is more religious than philosophical, as is the same with Christianity. People go through the motions, the way they were taught, and expect something in return and the whole time believing it will make things better.\n\n6.	Do you consider yourself to be a Stoic?\nI would say I am, but not based off of being able to successfully apply or explain its principles in any tangible way. That is why I am here. \nI know that living a Stoic lifestyle can be hard but it appears more attainable than Buddhism. As a white person who has grown up in the U.S., Buddhism retains a mystic and foreign quality which I believe is part of it’s draw towards “western” nations. Stoicism on the other hand is “western” in its figurative appearance and physical birth place compared to Buddhism and Christianity. With some minor historical exceptions from what I have read, Stoicism is egalitarian in principle on who can practice it regardless of color, sexual orientation, social status (Epictetus [slave] and Seneca [wealthy]), or even religion. It’s the way other religions should be, because it is right. \n\n7.	What you want to get from this course.\nI want to be able to practically apply Stoicism in my daily life, use it as a lens to filter through some of my irrational emotional responses, give me a little more peace in my life, and be able to explain it to others. It can be a tool and a lifestyle. Like I mentioned in the first question, Stoicism seems to fill the spiritual void within myself that religion (in my mind) typically fills. Until I found Stoicism I had even contemplated attending church services even though I don’t believe in god (or Jesus). I’m not sure if it was the communal aspect of it or a way to simplify things without thinking for myself. Religion tends to provide the answers to questions that people want to hear, however, that doesn’t mean it is right. I believe that it is solely within my own will to determine what is right or not. \n', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, '', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', 1, 0, '', '');

I was born in 1979 in a small town in Oklahoma. I was the first child between my parents, Bobby and Jan. Both were married prior and had other children previous to me. My only full-blooded sibling was born eleven months later. My brother\'s name is BJ. My parents divorced when I was six and my father took full custody of my brother and I. We moved to another small town in Oklahoma where I graduated high school. I went to a small liberal arts university in the same town called the University of Science and Arts of Oklahoma where I majored in Music Education. My plan was to teach high school music and work on becoming a pastor in a church. I did not finish college after four years, as I had married and didn\'t want both my wife and I to be teachers (she graduated the same university after majoring in Early Childhood Education). I was also struggling with my religious faith, which I will get into later. \n	I was not born into a religious family. Obviously, born in a community inside the Bible Belt, I was exposed to religious belief... there was practically a church on every corner, but religion was not a topic discussed in my home. Being a typical child, I was more interested in playing with my brother and friends in the neighborhood than asking existential questions. It wasn\'t until the age of fourteen that  I considered the existence of God, my mortality, and what of values and way of life I should consider following. All of that started with a girl. I was dating a girl whose family went to church, and she invited me to attend. I became involved in the youth group and was told that before I could go to church camp that I would have to accept Jesus as my “Lord and Savior”, which I did. Camp was a moving experience for me. It was there that I put some serious thought into existential questions and to belief in God. I began reading the Bible, probably more so than most kids my age. I figured that if God and Jesus were real, and that the Bible was “God\'s Word”, that it was important for me to learn what it means to be a good Christian. In fact, if the words of the Bible were true, that it seemed utterly important that I do my best to live them and do my best to serve God. At the age of sixteen I believed I was being called to serve in ministry, and to someday be a pastor of a church. This did not sit well with my dad. But eventually he came to approve of my decision.\n	I met my wife in high school while I was dating her best friend. I began attending her church and was very active in the youth group. In a sense, being religious and attending church was my way of rebelling against my father. He lived a more secular life that didn\'t involve religion, but lots of women and socializing.  He didn\'t seem to be living a very fulfilling life, and I figured there had to be more. Being involved in youth group kept me away from doing all the typical things teenagers do, like trying drugs or alcohol, or having sex. I completely bought into the idea that God had a plan for my life, and I believed that I should serve him by being the best Christian I could be. I probably read the Bible at least a handful of times, and I was also reading books by Christian ministers. After I broke up with my girlfriend, my wife and I remained friends until we started dating. We broke up during our senior year because I had come to believe that I should start preparing myself mentally and saving myself for my future wife.\n	When I graduated high school I honestly wasn\'t sure what I was suppose to do with myself. I wasn\'t smart enough or hard-working enough in high school to have earned a scholarship. My thoughts were to join the military like my dad and my uncles. But my father, who is a Vietnam veteran, was adamantly against this. He pushed me to go to college and get a job. I had already been working since the age of fifteen. I decided to attend the local university as it would allow me to still live at home and to work in my small town. I would go to college in the mornings and work in the evenings. I had started attending a different church and still wanted to pursue ministry. I was active in the church leadership where I helped in the music ministry, either running the sound system, or playing the piano. \n	I chose music education as my major more by accident. When I went to enroll, the only available professor to assist me was in the music department. We talked about my desire to be in ministry and she suggested I major in music education, and I didn\'t particularly feel compelled to enroll in anything else. However, attending a liberal arts university had a profound affect on me. It was there that I was exposed to contradicting philosophies, religions, and world views. Then, I attended a class on Logic and Critical Thinking skills. This was a mind-shaking class for me. I guess I have to admit that I\'ve always been naive. I was never a rebellious child, and when I was exposed to Christianity, I never thought to question those in authority on whether or not there were alternate world views. My family didn\'t place much emphasis on education, so I wasn\'t exposed to hardly any competing philosophies. Skepticism was not nurtured, and so, similar to never considering any existential questions prior to attending a church, I never once considered that Christianity could be wrong, or that I would have been better off by reading topics outside of what would confirm my worldview. It seems odd, because, looking back, I had the opportunity... I was well aware of philosophy and other religions, but I had come to accept that everything I believed was the truth, so there didn\'t seem a need to inquire further. \n	But my time in the class on Logic and Critical Thinking Skills changed all that. Especially when we covered logical fallacies. I couldn\'t help but apply them to my thinking and to my beliefs. I went through a terrible period of cognitive dissonance. I struggled to keep my faith and belief in God and in the truth of Christianity. I pushed myself to continue to believe by reading books on apologetics and Christian philosophy. But I eventually arrived at a place where I could not believe anymore. I deconverted after being a Christian for twelve years. I gave up my desire to be a pastor, and I dived head first into science and atheism. I was about twenty-six years old.\n	This all happened during and after I had left college. At this point I had married my wife at twenty-four. We married around the time she graduated college and I was working full-time. She didn\'t know much about my struggles with my faith, being deeply involved in the church herself. When I finally did come out, it took some time for her to accept. And after some heartfelt conversations, she also abandoned her faith as a Christian, though she says she still believed in God. She just wasn\'t sure where to go from there. \n	Before I had deconverted I was looking for a better job, as at the time I was considering management in the company I was working for, but the long hours were a strain on our young marriage. I had some friends from high school who joined the local police department, and tried to convince me that I should consider becoming a police officer. I was not one of those kids who dreamed of being a cop. I didn\'t even think I was qualified. I wasn\'t a big athletic type, and I didn\'t think I had the rough temperament that I assumed every cop had. But I knew that I wanted to support my family, and that the police department had benefits and a schedule that worked better for my family, so I put in an application. I also, at the time still being a Christian, felt that the whole path to becoming a minister wasn\'t working out, but I felt that I wanted to make a positive difference in my community, so after much prayer and talking with my wife, I felt that maybe God\'s plan for me was to get into law enforcement. I was hired in 2004.\n	Honestly, working in law enforcement was a big wake up call for me. I had encountered people and seen things that helped convince me, along with the cognitive dissonance I was experiencing from my studies in college, that I could no longer accept that Christianity was the truth. I was working overnight, which brought me into contact with a lot of people living in ways I had never imagined. The things that I saw people doing to each other, and the way that people chose to live, hardened me into becoming more cynical and suspicious of people. It eventually put a heavy strain on my marriage, as my wife saw me go from being a good-natured friendly man into a reserved and cynical person. She didn\'t like the effect being a police officer had on my personality. She ultimately gave me an ultimatum, telling me that I needed to do something before I fell deep into a hole of loathing and negativity, or find another line of work.\n	Now, I had never drank alcohol... I saw what it did to people and their families, so I didn\'t fall into the typical trap many of my coworkers fell into. I was also fiercely faithful to my wife, since she was my best friend, so I never considered cheating... I saw how being a womanizer left my dad. Many officers fall into negative outlets that take them into places that usually ended their marriages and careers. But I knew better than to take that route. What I felt a strong desire for was to know the truth of life. So my release, so to speak, was to busy myself by reading as much about science and history, and briefly touching on different philosophies, to work on myself. I knew that regardless of my career, I felt a strong desire to work on being the best version of myself, and to educate myself in anything I thought would help me be a better man.\n	I began to also become fed up with the “new atheism”. Though I was reading books by Richard Dawkins and Sam Harris, there weren\'t much in answers on how one should live after leaving behind a religious belief. I didn\'t find the things I was reading very satisfying. And so I started looking at other world religions and philosophies, and came across Buddhism and Zen. As I usually did, as soon as I found a topic I became interested in, I purchased a lot of books and went to a lot of websites in an attempt to learn and apply as much as I could. I started reading many of the Buddhist texts and from modern writers and practitioners. I felt I clicked more with Zen because there was hardly any emphasis on faith or the religious aspect of Buddhism. It seemed to fall inline more with modern science as well. I also started attending “sitting meditation” meetings with a zen monk who ran a martial arts studio. This all seem to help improve my attitude and outlook on the world and humanity. I felt by pursuing “enlightenment” that I would finally achieve a sort of mental and emotional... almost spiritual... salvation. But it seemed organized Buddhism fell into the same sort of trappings that organized Christianity did... and that hardly anyone even in Buddhism could give a final answer that other Buddhists could agree to. There was just as much in-fighting about what constituted the “Truth” as in Christianity, or every other religion, it seemed. Some of Buddhist practice seemed practical, but others did not. Like the time I had sat with a Theravadan monk (the guys you see in orange robes when you think of Buddhist monks) who told me that if I truly wanted to achieve enlightenment, or at least go as far as I can in that direction, I would have to abandon my wife and child and go live on a hermitage with other monks. That was certainly not the answer I was looking for, and really, out of the question. I felt a strong obligation to my family, and I felt that there had to be some reasonable way to not only still support my family, but also be a positive impact as a police officer in my community. The monk\'s answer was that I could only hope to be at best a “householder”, and that I should support the monks in hopes to someday be reincarnated into a better situation to attain enlightenment. Well... that was not a good enough answer for me.\n	About this time I had served a number of years in my small home town as a police officer. I was still looking for answers, but not really coming across anything that really grabbed me as being close to being the answer. My wife\'s parents had moved to a metro area across the state, who we had visited several times and liked the community, so we began to talk of getting away from the place we grew up, married, attended college, and started our careers. It didn\'t help that as being a police officer, I had to deal with many people we grew up with, and it started to become a dangerous situation for my family, as people I had arrested knew where I lived, and knew my family. My wife was once confronted and threatened in a store by someone I had dealings with. It was a scary moment for her and for me, especially considering our daughter was still very young. \n	I had another friend who was a state trooper, and told me for years that I should consider joining the Highway Patrol. I would continually joke off his suggestions, until my wife and I began to consider moving closer to her parents, and finding a better community to raise our daughter. I also didn\'t want to start over at another police department, but I didn\'t have a degree, and really no skills with which to find a job paying enough to support my family. I applied for the tough patrol school and was accepted. I graduated in 2012 and, as Fate would have it, assigned to the same area my in-laws lived. We moved to a suburb in a safe area close enough for my wife to be able to see her mother regularly. But I was still struggling internally to find some way to better myself as a person, and I still lacked a belief in a god, so going back to church was out of the question. And Buddhism no longer seemed to have the lasting answers I was looking for. I was also struggling with the idea that I even needed to find a philosophy of life. It seemed so many people live just fine, and lived good lives just doing what normal people do... go to work, raise their families, be active in social circles, mow the lawn... typical suburban living. I was very happy on my job, making good money, and I was making a difference in a way I felt I needed to. So why should I continue to have existential angst?\n	But I did. I also didn\'t have much of a social life outside of work. It\'s typical for state troopers to live so far apart due to being assigned to large geographic areas, that we couldn\'t get together to socialize. Plus, just because someone is a cop, doesn\'t necessarily translate into them being the kind of people I wanted to socialize with... some had personalities that I didn\'t click with, and they didn\'t share the same interests outside of our profession. I found out my uncle was a freemason, and I knew that as a kid my dad was a Jaycee... both being fraternal and civic organizations. I wanted to meet people outside of my career and in my local community, so I began looking at different civic organizations to possibly join. I figured it would give me the opportunity to get to know other people in a positive environment (I didn\'t go to bars, nor was I much interested in sporting events). It would also be a way to doing something good in my community. The Highway Patrol also encourages their troopers to get active in the community as a way to foster a positive relationship between the community and local law enforcement. I had talked to my uncle, the freemason, about freemasonry, and learned that they do background checks on potential members before allowing them to join... I didn\'t want to be around a bunch of knucklehads, or people who would endanger my family.. They also have many charitable efforts... my uncle had a son who was born with muscular dystrophy, and the freemasons had sent him to a hospital at no cost to my uncle\'s family (he is a poor farmer). They also emphasized studying philosophy and that as freemasons they were about improving themselves, and working together to improve their communities. I liked this idea over joining the Elks Lodge, because they had no character requirements, and the Elks I knew were involved in throwing alcoholic parties. I wasn\'t interested in the Rotary Club because they seemed to be more business-focused... making business contacts... and that didn\'t appeal to me. So I joined the local masonic lodge. \n	Now I certainly encountered a number of good people... I got to meet men who aspired to be a positive difference in the community. And the lodge was active in raising funds to support various causes like food drives and donating money to a veterans private support organization. I also enjoyed the beautiful rituals that emphasized developing in the virtues of wisdom, courage, justice, and temperance. And I found the silly conspiracy theories about the freemasons trying to rule the world to be false... they can barely agree to what color to paint the lodge room, let alone conspire to control society. The freemasons suffered from the same pitfalls any other social organization experiences... conflicting personalities and beliefs. But as I said before... when I become interested in a topic, I tend to dive heavily into the subject, and so I read as many books as I could on masonic philosophy. What I discovered was that, though couched in religious symbolism, the freemasons were heavily influenced by Hellenistic philosophy (which explains why their four cardinal virtues directly mirrors the Platonic virtues). But what I found lacking about the freemasons was that not everyone was interested in philosophy, or learning how to be a better man... some joining for the social aspect, others for the charitable aspect, but really beyond the ritual in the degrees, no one really pushing themselves to learn life wisdom, though the rituals themselves stress such an endeavor. It seemed modern freemasonry was more interested in signing up guys into appendant bodies like the Shriners or Scottish Rite, collecting dues, and obtaining recognition by advancing through the leadership chairs in the local lodge. And really... something just seemed to missing from the philosophical aspect. A measure of it was based on faith, and freemasonry didn\'t seem to have the impact it once did concerning the advancement of human knowledge and understanding.\n	And so, how does any of this lead me to Stoic practice? As I had begun reading masonic philosophy, I was exposed to the influences of masonic thought, primarily in the Hellenistic philosophies. I wanted to know how the freemasons came to be, what was their history.. which lead me to Western philosophy and the history of philosophy in general, especially in Europe. That, in turn, lead me to the ancient Greeks, and the characters of Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle. I had began reading the works of Plato, and even the modern Western philosophers, like Nietzsche, and some political theory influenced by the Enlightenment period that had an affect on freemasons such as George Washington and Benjamin Franklin. But modern philosophy was hard to follow... seemingly more academic, and less practical. Plus, politics wasn\'t much of an interest to me. \n	As Fate would have it. I ran across an article on the Stoics, which didn\'t have much impact on me at the time. This was early 2016. I then ran across an interview of a person who stated they carried a copy of the Meditations everywhere they went. And so I found the text and read through it. I then read about the life of Marcus Aurelius and soon started studying about the philosophy he subscribed to. I ordered a copy of Seneca\'s Letters, read his work On Anger, bought a copy of Epictetus\' Handbook, then read his Discourses. I really began to feel that I was on to something... a philosophy that was practical for the individual, but also sufficiently coherent to explain the workings of the world in a reasonable and logical way. I found that I could directly apply the musings of Marcus Aurelius to my daily life. It didn\'t so much effect external things around me as it began to help me understand myself, and to cultivate an understanding of the inner-workings of my mind, and how I can flourish as a human being. The arguments I was reading of the logical progression to excelling as a human being in the works of Epictetus seemed like a home-coming moment for me. So I started reading modern works covering the Stoics and Stoic philosophy. One of my favorite, outside the Meditations, the writings of Seneca and Epictetus, was The Inner Citadel by Pierre Hadot. I wanted a firmer understanding of the Meditations and the philosophical framework behind them, and this book was a major influence on my thinking. It helped me solidify my understanding of Stoicism by bringing together the major points within the philosophy without having to read all the ancient texts first. There are other books I have read, such as Massimo Pigliucci\'s “How To Be A Stoic”, but I didn\'t find it as helpful. \n	But the topic of God was still a major sticking point for me. Though, as a freemason, I had to profess a belief in God (however I chose to define it), I had ran across the works of Chris Fisher while I was a member of one of the larger Stoic groups that emphasized a more modern agnostic/atheistic understanding. I could accept that God is the universe, and not some anthropomorphic understanding as the Abrahamic faiths understood it, but I couldn\'t bring myself to understand the concept of God in the way Fisher was proclaiming. I had another bout of cognitive dissonance. It took me reading Fisher\'s works on his website, which were heavily cited from the ancient works along with modern academic sources, and from listening to his podcast, did I finally arrive at a version of God that I could support. I still read from his Path of the Prokopton series and from his essay on Prosoche daily. Fisher\'s work has had a profound effect on me, and I hold him in the highest regard. Plus, we both work in law enforcement, so I feel a special connection, though we\'ve never met.\n	So for the past two years, since 2016, I would call myself a Stoic... a prokopton... and after opening myself up to putting in the time to understand where Fisher was coming from, I could now say I am a traditional Stoic. I don\'t believe that Stoic practice is one devoid of the logical and physics portion, and that emphasis can be placed on ethics alone. As Fisher states in his Path of the Prokopton series... Stoicism is an iterative process that demands an understanding of all three aspects that work together. I\'m still a Freemason... though I don\'t attend like I use to... mostly due to my work schedule... and I still find it beneficial to doing something practical in my community with other people. I feel I\'ve finally arrived at a philosophy of life that gives me a sense of completeness that doesn\'t conflict with my understanding of science and logic.\n	And so I find myself here... interested in the SES course. Fisher recommended it, stating that it goes deeper than just his own writings and podcast. What I would like to gain from this course is a surer foundation in my understanding of Stoic philosophy, and a pathway to deeper understanding of my pursuit of wisdom... to live purposely, to be an excellent human being, and to fulfill my roles to my wife, my daughter, my friends, my co-workers, my neighbors, my community, and ultimately to all of humanity in a way that is beneficial. And I think Stoicism holds the key for me to all of this. And if I successfully complete the course I am also looking at participating in the Marcus Aurelius school.

I am ready to start the SES course in January 2019. Thanks a lot in advance!', 'Know Thyself\n\nMy name is Felix Homburg and I was born in Germany 45 years ago. I grew up in a family of teachers, studied electrical engineering and subsequently started working for Mercedes-Benz. During the last 15 years, I lived and worked in Germany, USA, Argentina, Mexico, South Africa, and India. Since November 2017 I am in Miami. \n\nIn my late 30s, I realized my professional dream and became CEO of the South African Mercedes-Benz subsidiary. All along the way, I had a rather unreflected philosophy of “enlightened-hedonism”:  Trying to maximize pleasures and minimize pains through the increase of both my social status and accumulation of wealth. Thinking that this would translate into more happiness and wellbeing. In my early 40s though, during the peak of my professional career, I realized that my state of wellbeing was not correlating with any of the maximized external factors. At that point, I knew that I needed a better way of life hence a better philosophy.\n\nUntil that point, I had looked at character development, self-growth, spirituality, philosophy, and religion as separate entities. On the religious side, I have been agnostic since my adolescence, critical to the Christian doctrine of focusing on an afterlife, the concept of sin and withdrawal from society once practitioners (e.g. monks or priests) become more advanced.\n\nOn the intellectual side, one of my hobbies in the last decade has been neuroscience. I learned that our brain is plastic and capable of massive change but I also understood that in order to develop or change character traits this requires deliberate and constant practice. When I was looking at any religion or spirituality in the past, and comparing its practices with what I knew from the field of neuroscience, I did not find anything that leads to develop the best version of myself (or to bring about human excellence) and passed the test of neuroscience.\n\nOne successful example that I admire in terms of character development is one of Benjamin Franklin. I learned that he took a set of virtues that he wanted to acquire and developed a daily practice to alter and improve his character towards this virtues through constant reflection. I mimicked that in my professional context by developing similar reflection sheets to alter my behaviors and habits.\n\nWhile I was in India in 2015, I started to explore Buddhism and discovered a progressive path to train my mind. This fascinated me and ever since I have integrated a daily meditation practice into my life. This has allowed me to develop a greater ability for sustained attention and mindfulness not only during the practice but also in my daily activities. However, the way of social withdrawal of the followers of the Buddhist path is not for me. I knew that my self-development needs to happen with the goal to become a better person within society and not withdrawn from it.\n\nDuring the last three years, I delved into philosophy and studied Friedrich Nietzsche and was deeply shaken by his poignant prediction of Nihilism as a consequence of modernity ‘killing\' religion and mysticism. I understood, that the two main catastrophes of the 20th century were no coincidences since both Fascism and Communism filled the void that the absence of religion and mysticism left. Also, Nietzsche’s criticism of Christianity with its focus on the afterlife deeply moved me. This triggered me to think about my own morality and its foundation and my own position on theism and mysticism. I realized that from a pure atheist point it becomes difficult to construct a system of values since a cardinal value that holds the system of Ethics together is missing. \n\nI also struggled a lot with Social Justice movements and its underlying philosophy of Postmodernism. On a superficial level, I saw sometimes noble causes in some of these movements but also a lot of people with rather questionable behaviors and characters. A lot of the actions I witnessed were driven by negative emotions of anger, hate, and envy. (or in Nietzsche words “ressentiment”). One of my questions was: If people practice and indulge constantly in bad behaviors and negative emotions, what kind of character traits would that develop over time? My answer was consistent with the observation of many of these “Social-Justice-Warriors”: None of them embodied anything in terms of character and human excellence like Benjamin Franklin did. Also, in many instances, I found core doctrines that went heavily against reason and science in the Social-Justice-Movements, e.g.:  All human society and its structures are just arbitrary social constructs, biology in terms of innate differences do not exist etc. For me the intellectual laziness and the lack of reason in arguments of Social-Justice-Warriors were striking. So despite the sometimes noble causes, the postmodern way of thinking and acting is a dead-end for me. \n\nAbout a year ago I had the first exposure to Stoicism. I read a couple of books of Holiday, Irvine, Robertson and Pigliucci and was immediately electrified by the approach of philosophy as a practical way of life rather than an intellectual game. The exercises I saw reminded me of what I had learned as effective ways to induce a lasting change in the brain and character of a person. But I struggled to understand the broader context of these exercises. For example, Irving postulated the goal of tranquility as the end of Stoic practices. This did not make sense to me as a valuable end goal of one’s life. Also, all the sources I read from Epictetus and Marcus Aurelius did not support Irvine’s claim. So a year ago I looked at Stoicism as an interesting collection of exercises but not as a holistic philosophy for my life.\n\nIn October this year, I read The Consolation of Philosophy which re-ignited my interest to understand Stoicism fully. I subsequently read Pierre Hadot’s “Philosophy as a way of life” and discovered at the same time Chris Fisher’s Stoicism on Fire podcast. That opened the way into a better understanding of Traditional Stoicism as a holistic philosophy and not just a collection of secular exercises. With more understanding, the elements I had read about in different books started to make sense when looked at them under the premise of a rational, providentially ordered cosmos. This Stoic approach to religion is something that I feel very comfortable with because it does not require to change my rationality into supernatural or transcendental beliefs. \n\nWith everything I learned during the last couple of months about Traditional Stoicism, I believe that this holistic, practical philosophy with human excellence as an end goal is the right path for me to study and practice. I looked for ways how to do this methodically and found the curriculum of the School of Essential Studies (SES) of the College of Stoic Philosophers. I am excited about this opportunity and curious about what the SES course will bring about. I am willing to put in the time and effort to complete the study, exercises, and practices. If it is possible, I would like to request for Chris Fisher to be my mentor during the SES time. I am ready to start the SES course in January 2019. Thanks a lot in advance!\n\nHappy Holidays from Miami\nFelix Homburg\n\n\n\n\n\n', 1, '2019-05-20', 0, 0, 0, '', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 'Felix dropped out of Logic after Ian requested he rewrite one of his papers.', '', 0, 0, '', ''),

I am Irish by birth and my lineage is very much Irish going back as far as my great grandparents who were all born in Ireland. I know nothing of my family tree beyond them. I had a very good relationship with my mother and my father’s father in particular but I didn’t have a very good relationship with my father. I was quite wild in my teens. \r\nI am happily married for the second time. I do not have children. My first marriage ended after 16 years primarily due to loss and sadness caused by the fact that we were unable to have children and had experienced a number of miscarriages. This loss, coupled with work I had done in the Samaritans (a charity that supports lonely/suicidal people) for many years in my 20s, prompted me to begin a degree in counselling psychotherapy when I was in my 30s. I went on to complete a Masters and to work fulltime as a psychotherapist. \r\nI have a comfortable life and am financially secure. I have some good friends and I’m fit and healthy. I had a malignant melanoma tumour removed two years ago but I am cancer free. I have my bad days, like everyone else, where I struggle to be positive. \r\n\r\n\r\nI have been interested in Stoicism for about twenty years. I first encountered Stoicism via a paper on cognitive therapy and decided to read about the philosophy, especially Ethics though I also have an understanding of other elements such as Physics and Nature. Stoicism helped me greatly in three areas of my life. \r\n1. Many years ago, there was a short period during which the circumstances of my life meant that I felt very alone and could not see a happy future. I decided to take a few days off to carefully and objectively consider how I could change my perspective. In part, Stoicism provided me with logical ways of making some fundamental changes to my attitudes, beliefs and assumptions. Those days were a very important part of my journey towards becoming a Stoic. \r\n2. When my father was dying of cancer and I was his main source of support, I found daily contemplation of certain Stoic concepts very supportive. In particular, trying to view my life through the prism of each day only, the View from Above and what was in my control and what was not in my control. \r\n3. In my work as a psychotherapist, I find elements of Stoicism very helpful to my clients as they search for meaning and purpose. Similarly, Stoic concepts such as Prosoche can be very helpful for clients as they challenge their negative automatic thinking. Having been introduced to a few core elements of Stoicism, a few clients have themselves embraced Stoicism at a very deep level (deeper than me) and report how transformative they have found the philosophy.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have read quite a few books on Stoicism, the main books being: Meditations, Stoicism and the Art of Happiness, Letters from a Stoic and Epictetus\'s Enchiridion. I also use Exeter University\'s Stoic Workbook very regularly. I found Meditations to be a fascinating insight into the mind of a true Stoic and how existential conflicts and the struggles of everyday life are so similar and constant across the millennia. \r\n\r\n\r\nI am a reluctant Atheist. I would like to believe in the afterlife and a loving God, but I am deeply unimpressed by various religious dogmas that are essentially, in my opinion, the thoughts of other human beings as to what God is and how I should live my life. Much of theses religious dogmas appear, to me and at best, wishful thinking. They provide no evidence whatsoever for their beliefs. So, for me, I don\'t believe there is a God that I can understand or worship. That doesn\'t mean that the Universe wasn\'t created and, by extension, that we weren\'t created. I just don\'t know enough to believe in \'God\'. \r\n\r\n\r\nI was raised a Catholic but I was never fully engaged with the religion and never connected with the concept of Jesus or the dogma. Essentially, I have had no deep religious beliefs for all of my life. I have not considered myself to be a \'Catholic\' for many years. Because Catholicism is deeply rooted in Irish society, I regularly attend funeral Masses, christenings, memorial Masses etc. but they have no meaning for me.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn my late teens, I read books by Sartre. I have also read papers by Buber, Kierkegaard, Frankl and Heidegger as part of my studies many years ago. I can barely remember anything much about Sartre. Similarly, the existentialists were studied for essays that I had to write at that time. I remember some of their principles but only from an academic perspective. In my early twenties, I read many books by Kafka and found his view of the world to be bleak yet realistically comforting.\r\n\r\n\r\nStoicism provides my main guiding principles as I try to understand the world, the universe, existence and as a blueprint for engaging with other human beings. I often lose sight of my Stoic principles as daily existence, relationships and life\'s speed bumps arouse my \'passions\'. However, I always return to Stoicism to help me understand my emotions and why I\'m feeling that way. In answer to the question “Do you consider yourself to be a Stoic?”, I would say that I am closer to being a Stoic than being anything else other than a person and a psychotherapist. It is the foundation of my understanding of humanity and has validated my inherent moral code. Having said all of that, I’m well able to stray away from living the Stoic Good Life not least because, well, I enjoy the good life too!\r\n\r\n\r\nI would like to further my knowledge of Stoicism and how it can help me to achieve a greater sense of Eudaimonia. I can read more books on Stoicism and continue my daily Stoic meditations but I would like a knowledgeable person to accompany me on that journey. \r\n', 1, '2019-08-20', 1, 0, 0, '', 0, '', 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 'George’s interest in Stoicism was sparked 21 years ago by a reference to Stoicism in a paper he was reading about cognitive therapy.

I had a good friend, a japanese who lived nearby, and with whom I learned an important lesson:although I could read some stuff he couldn´t, I should not publicise that,I was not superior because of that.\n        Another lesson I learned at school. I made friendship with an Italian boy.But we were both eleven, and by that age children are mean.And our colleagues took advantage of his accent and lack of knowledge of the environment to humiliate him.It was the classical bullying.I saw it all. And did nothing. The guilt would reamain till nowadays.But I started to sympathise with people in adversities.What was a profit.\n       I was diagnosed with schizophrenia when I was nineteen.I am forty eight now, and during this time I experienced a number of doctors, therapists and, above all, medicines. The therapists were mostly futile people, whose meaning of life lied in sensoreous pleasure, prestige and money.Not surprisingly they did not help me.Also, the medicines were uneficcient.I believe they usually are much less efficient than what doctors claim.Perhaps  laboratories have a part in it.\n       Both my parents are very insecure people, and became desperate when they learned about my dignostic.And sadly, they relied on very conservative doctors, for whom dialogue was time wasted, schizophrenia had genetic causes ( not environmental), and the only thing to do was to give me very strong drugs. As I could refuse them, after their side effects, they recomended my hospitalization. As a result of these policies, I did become handicapped, and unable to lead a normal life. One of the doctors told my mother I would never do anything beyond dish washing.\n       But this was all untrue.I always liked philosophy, and I started reading more, and pondering.\n       I perceived two important pillars of schizophrenia:the sense of not belonging, and a lack of rationality.For me, till now, these are the main reasons people with schizophrenia remain isolated,resentfull and fearfull.Nevertheless, it is possible to change this landscape.With some insights of some philosophers.\n       Probably you have heard of deliriums.These are beliefs only the ill person has,and impossible to remove.That is not the whole truth, but I will ponder after it.I presume you have heard about the Skeptics.Well, let´s make the glass of beer reasoning. Suppose you ordered a beer, and there is a glass of it in your table.You and all other customers who see it agree that there is a glass of beer.This is an imediate and trustable thought. But then, you look at the waiter, and you start fantasizing he spitted in your beer. Well, not everybody will agree to that, and that is not imediate, it is  a construction, and doubtfull.\n       I fantasized a lot in my life. I thought there were cameras and microphones all the time recording me, and producing material for a tv show that was exhibited in other countries.And I built a lot of conclusions.For example, I thought my neighbour was a mossad agent, and to show him my despise, I through shit into his garden.\n        But then I realized something interesting.These were all constructions, doubtfull thoughts. The detail here, is not to deny the delirium, that doesn´t work, but to put it into doubt. Instead of telling myself that was all false,what was highly unpleasant, I told myself that was all doubtfull, what was more acceptable.\n       This rationalism may be very helpfull.But that´s only the begining of the story.\n       What is it not to belong? Well, people usually belong to something. They may belong to their family, to a political idea,  to an artistic taste, perhaps you belong to the universitie where you work.Some people, when they age and get more experienced,become very tolerant to other´s point of view, and develop a sense of belonging to mankind. And some inspired people feel conected to the cosmos, I believe the best and strongest sense of belonging.\n         People with schizophrenia as I said, don´t belong.And they are demanding.Your group of friends who join to watch a football game or have a barbecue won´t provide them the intense feeling of belonging they long for,But when you speak of a cosmic dimension, that may work.\n       Well, the first part is Skeptical and the second you may say Indian. It is true. But many Stoic ideas, principles may help in both.I built a circle in my brain:I not only doubt my deliriums, I pause to examine reality always, a prudent attitude, stoic I would say, and I feel conected to the cosmos, what may also sound stoic.So, one thing helps the other, through daily rationalism I have calm, what allows me to feel conected to the cosmos what in turn gives me calm and helps me to be rational.\n        That doctor said I would never go beyond dish washing. He was wrong.I have now given more than twenty lectures, I wrote a book and I am a facilitator.( a person who directs conversations among peers with similar diagnostic).\n          Do you have any idea how these peer support groups work? Well, I have become an expert in that. A stoic posture helps a lot.Do not judge what they say, try to understand the logics behind the absurds, and never loose calm.Forget about all competition. This way they will respect you.\n          So I built some success in my life. But curiously, this success depends on not craving for it. It is the detachment that will bring prestige.It is when they see you don´t care about loosing, that they will make you a winner among them.\n          I have not many friends and I fear solitude in my old age, and lack of money.But in the weekends I stroll with my dog in a deserted square near home, and we both experience the pleausure of the shadows and of the wind, and it seems my dog understands it all and is gratefull to me for bringing him also to the presence of Brahma or Zeus.\n          Yet, who will recognize this beautifull moment of art? \n          I saw an Woody Allen interview the other day.He complained that all disappears, all the great artitsts will be one day forgotten, the earth will disapear so will  the Sun.And that made him pessimistic.Strange as it may seem, that´s what brings me joy! \n           I don´t know how the teaching of Stoicism goes.I hope it is not in the Indian fashion, where the student has to blindly believe all the master´s words, and in fact serve his master. If I were in India, away from everything perhaps I wouldn´t complain about that, but for the moment I am sick of psychiatrists who dwell in a superior world, whose fart doesn´t smell, and whose words cost us all we can pay.\n           I would like to have a friend.\n           My father and mother are ageing fast, and I see all the time we could have spent together, but we wasted. I see my brother who, after my deliriums, doesn´t trust me as a helpér, I see my other brother who doesn´t fantasize, but is so submerged into his shyness he also wastes his life.It is all sad.\n             I´d like to perpetuate those moments in the square, or to make them prevail.\n                     \n\n  \n        \n\n\n       \n      \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n', 1, '2019-05-21', 0, 0, 0, '', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', 0, 0, '', '');

My name is Anthony Aguirre.  I am writing this essay seeking admission to the College of Stoic Philosophers, School of Essential Studies.  I am 51 years old, a U.S. citizen, and reside in Chicago, Illinois, where I was born and have lived (almost) my entire life.  I am married for 20 years and have 2 boys, ages 11 and 12.\r\n\r\nMy interest in Stoicism began in childhood.  I remember at 8 or 9 years thumbing through a book my father had, Understanding Philosophy,  by C H Perelman. I do not know why the book interested me, or why I went to its table of contents specifically looking for something on the Stoics.  I knew nothing of Stoicism at the time, but did have the notion that they were men who were impervious to pain, if not unfeeling.  How I got these ideas I cannot say.  I still have the book.  The chapter on Stoicism is pretty sparse, and I did not understand much, if anything, of what I read there.\r\n\r\nThough raised a Roman Catholic, I developed an interest in Buddhism in high school after reading Buddhism: A Way of Life and Thought, by Nancy Wilson Ross, and What the Buddha Taught, by Walpola Rahula.  While drawn to Buddhism for many reasons, I did not accept the atheistic stance the religion takes; I have always believed in God and continue to believe in God.  I am a theist in that I believe, as defined by the 17th century theologian Ralph Cudworth, in “a perfectly conscious understanding being, or mind, existing of itself from eternity, and was the cause of all other things".  And while I do pray to God, I cannot say that I believe in miracles or hold to an anthropomorphic view of the Divine.  No longer considering myself Catholic, I still attend a Catholic church regularly.\r\n\r\nDuring my college years I drifted between Buddhism and Catholicism.  Both had aspects that I agreed with and attracted me, and both had aspects that I disagreed with and did not like.  I married at 30, and taught grade school for 3 years, from 1996 to 2000, before becoming a police officer in 2000.  I took a second job as a security job at a junior college and got on with the business of life.  One activity that my wife and I have always liked to do was visit bookstores.  I was already an adult, well into my 30s, when I picked up The Art of Living: The Classical Manual on Virtue, Happiness, and Effectiveness, by Sharon Lebell.  This book, as you may know, is her interpretation of Epictetus’ Enchiridion.  The book made little impact on me.  I breezed through it, put it on a bookshelf, and forgot about it.\r\n\r\nMaybe around 2003 I read Letters of a Stoic, by Seneca.  These rekindled my interest in Stoicism.  I went on to read a few of his other essays, and then read Meditations by Marcus Aurelius.  I found that the writings gave me much to think about, but still felt something was missing.  I liked what I read, but still could not elucidate what Stoicism was, as a philosophy?  What are its core principles?  What are its fundamental beliefs?  If someone were to ask me, “What is Catholicism?”, I could easily answer what its beliefs and practices are.  If I were asked, “What is Buddhism?”, likewise, I could provide an answer.  Yet after reading some Seneca and Marcus, I still was not sure how to describe Stoicism, how the pieces fit together.\r\n\r\nMy first son was born in 2006, and in 2007, my second son came into my life.  I was surprised  by how much I could love my boys and how much I did love them, and by how much happiness they brought to my life.  And here was the problem.  I was too happy.  I began to think and obsess about all the bad things that could happen to my children:  accidents, diseases, predators, kidnapping, death, etc.  How could I protect them from all this?  They brought me so much happiness that I thought I would go crazy, lose my mind, if they were to be permanently separated from me.  What could I do?  What foolproof system could I find or come up with that would protect them from any harm?  There is none.  As Epictetus says, “If you wish your children, and your wife, and your friends to live forever, you are stupid.”\r\n\r\nI searched online for answers, still for ways that would help me protect my children, but more now for ways to help myself.  One day I came across an interview of James Stockdale where he credited the Discourses of Epictetus for helping him survive his years as a P.O.W. in Vietnam.  This book helped him survive the most brutal conditions a human being could suffer. I had to read this book.  If it could help him, it certainly could help me.  So I read the book and didn’t understand a lot of it, though the parts I did understand resonated with me, made sense, and I found to be true.   Still, it was not clear as to how can I have my desires unhindered? Or how can I make sure I never meet any thing that I am averse to?  I must have missed the part where Epictetus explicitly stated how to do this.  So I re-read the book.  Slowly things started to become clearer, and Stoicism started to make more sense.  "There are things within my power and not in my power."  "For everything that happens there is reason to praise Providence."  "Do not wish for things to be different, but wish for them to happen as they do."  "God is the father of men and gods."  I intuitively knew that I had found something of value, something that provided answers to my dilemmas.  I had found something that could also protect my children, truly, from all harm in life.  Not from disease and accident and harm from man.  No. Instead I had found a means to protect them from true evil, vice.  For what does Socrates say? "Anytus and Meletus can kill me, but they cannot hurt me": and further, he says, "If it so pleases God, so let it be."\r\n\r\nWould I consider myself a Stoic?  Before I answer this question I should define what I think a Stoic is.  Actually, I go to Epictetus, on his definition of what a Stoic is:  "For wherein will you show that you really consider virtue equal to everything else or even superior? But show me a Stoic, if you can. Where or how?... Show me a man who is sick and happy, in danger and happy, dying and happy, in exile and happy, in disgrace and happy. Show him: I desire, by the gods, to see a Stoic."\r\n\r\nI would be a hypocrite if I were to call myself a Stoic.  I am working on it.  Is my mind completely free of perturbations?  Do I follow God, the Deity, Zeus, in all things?  Is his will my will?  Am I happy with all that God brings me?  Daily, in the smallest inconveniences of my life, do I see how all things are guided by Providence and work out for the benefit of the Whole?  Do I value that which is divine and happy, namely my soul, over that which is miserable and mortal, that is, the body?  Have I a disregard for all things external and value only that which the gods have placed in my power, a right use of appearances?  Do I still equate happiness with pleasure and freedom with liberty?  Do I reverence the Daemon within, do I render it true service by keeping it free from violence and harm, free from passion and thoughtlessness?  Do I wake up, ready to do a man’s work, working to some aim, thankful to God for being invited to the festival?  On paper it seems easy enough to be Stoic, like learning to ride a bicycle:  get on the bike and pedal and try not to run into anything.  Then you get on the bike for the first time, and try to pedal; it\'s harder than it looked.  Then you pedal and fall.  And fall again.  And again.  And again.  This is the stage where I am at; I am still falling.  No, I do not consider myself a Stoic; but I hope to be a Stoic one day.  From childhood I was taught that the gratification of desire and the avoidance of discomfort was the summum bonum of life.  I was taught to assert my will in all things and to be angry or sad when I could not.  I was taught that the good lies in having things and the bad in the not having.  I developed a lot of ingrained habits and dispositions.  As Antisthenes states, “The most useful piece of learning for the uses of life is to unlearn what is untrue.”  Musonius Rufus echoes this when he states that “practical exercise is the more important for the student of philosophy than for the student of medicine or any similar art, the more philosophy claims to be a greater and more difficult discipline than any other study. The reason for this is that men who enter the other professions have not had their souls corrupted beforehand and have not learned the opposite of what they are going to be taught, but the ones who start out to study philosophy have been born and reared in an environment filled with corruption and evil, and therefore turn to virtue in such a state that they need a longer and more thorough training.”\r\n\r\nI was over 40 years of age when I began the study of Stoicism as way of life, and not as a dilettante.  I am hoping that through the study of this course that I will make further advances in understanding and practice.  Stoicism has brought me much peace and I can say that, within, I am not the same man I was 20 years ago, or even 10 years ago; but I still have a way to go.  Those things I once thought were good I no longer hold to be good;  those things I once thought to be bad or evil, I no longer think to be bad or evil.  "The good then are virtues, and the things which participate in virtues; and the bad are the vices, and the things which participate in them."  "The things which are independent of the will are nothing to me.  Tell me also about the Good, what was your opinion?  A will such as we ought to have and also such a use of appearances.  And the end, what is it?  To follow Thee."  I do not want partial victory, but complete victory.  And what is complete victory?  Epictetus tell us, “It is that which ought to be the most noble and the most becoming to those who are really educated:  release from perturbation, release from fear, freedom.”  I would like to echo, day by day and moment by moment, the words of Diogenes "who says that death is no evil, for neither is it base; fame is the noise of madmen. And as for pain and pleasure and poverty? He says that to be naked is better than any purple robe, and to sleep on the bare ground is the softest bed...there is no enemy, all is peace."  In a word, to achieve eudaimonia.\r\n\r\nApart from the Discourses, I have also read lectures of Musonius Rufus and parts of the Memorabilia of Socrates, by Xenophon.  While Zeno of Citium is considered the formal founder of Stoicism, I can see how ultimately the philosophy might trace itself back to Socrates and Antisthenes.  Thank you for your consideration in admitting me to the College of Stoic Philosophers, School of Essential Studies course.\r\n', 1, '2019-07-16', 1, 0, 0, '', 0, '', 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 'Anthony Aguirre is the Headmaster of the CoSP Preparatory School.

I’ve lived in the North East of England my whole life and in Blyth, a coastal town in South East Northumberland for the last 30 years. I live in a Victorian terraced house with Issy, my wife and my two sons - Sam aged 26 & Jason aged 25. Sam works as an administrator in a local hospital and Jason will shortly be completing his training to be a firefighter.\n\nI had a pretty happy middle-class upbringing. My mother worked as a book keeper and my father was a salesman. When I was nine, we moved from the city to a rural village when my parents bought a pub. I was moderately academic but very uninterested in school and left at 15 with few qualifications. I lived with my parents until I was 15 years old – our relationship was pretty strained around this time and at 15, I left home & moved to a local city where I joined a college to study social work. I was pretty immature and the attraction of drink, girls and socialising meant my interest in college waned quickly and I lasted there around 6 months. I spent some time after this doing very little - hanging out with friends, going to pubs, listening to bands before I started an apprenticeship to learn plumbing which meant moving to a nearby town to attend college. I was in a long(ish) term relationship at this time but I met Issy who is my now wife at college, I split up with my long term girlfriend and within a few weeks moved into an apartment with Issy – I then ditched my plumbing apprenticeship and spent some more time loafing around!\n\nAt age 17 I went to work for my parents. By this time, they had sold their pub & bought an event catering company so I joined them and worked with them for the next eight years. \n\nIn 1991 Issy and I had our first son, Sam, followed in 1993 by Jason our second son. The nature of my work meant I often worked evenings but it also meant I was often around during the day to take the kids to school, pick them up, make their dinner etc. so we developed a really close relationship which we still have today. \n\nIn 1995 I was involved helping my parents and brother in law renovate an old cottage and this sparked my interest I construction and renovation. I rethought my career, left my job, went back to college in 1996, and then on to university the following year to study Building Surveying.\n\nAfter graduation, I worked in a variety of building surveying roles before starting work for a loss adjusting practice in 2004 where I specified and oversaw the repair of buildings after they had suffered a flood, fire, impact or other insured peril. Although I’ve worked for a number of companies, this is the area of work I’ve been in ever since. One of the companies I worked for was taken over in 2012/13 and there were some major changes made to my role. I was very unhappy at the time, culminating in me having a bit of a crisis and leaving work with anxiety and depression in 2014. I didn’t work for around 12 months but then started back – first picking up some ‘side’ work doing architectural photography, followed by a 12 month contract back in insurance building surveying carrying me through to 2016 when I set up as a freelance building surveyor – I still do this today, working with a variety of insurance clients.\n\nI still have both my parents and they live just a few miles from me so I get to see them at least once a week – our relationship is great now we’re all a bit older. Family is something that’s really important to me – I speak to people who don’t get on with their family members or who don’t have time for their kids and I feel lucky that we are all so close.\n\nI’ve been interested in Stoicism for around the last 12 months. I first became aware of it when buying something from Amazon and A Guide to the Good Life by William Irvine was one of the “Recommended for You” books. I’ve always had an interest in psychology and I love to read so I bought the book. Something seemed to make sense when I read it and I immediately bought Stoicism and the Art of Happiness by Donald Robertson. I remember reading about ideas such as ‘living in accordance with nature’ and really struggling to grasp what they meant, but at the same time there was definitely something about Stoicism that was resonating with me – Donald Robertson’s is actually the first book I’ve was interested in enough (or struggled with sufficiently) to make notes on since leaving university. \n\nI feel that studying Stoicism has helped me. I’ve been susceptible to low mood since I left work in 2014 but I find that this has occurred less often since I started to read about Stoicism. Although I frequently get out of the habit of reading, I find that at the times in my life when I’m reading a Stoic text or contemplating stoic ideas there is a carry over of increased contentment and love towards others in my daily life.\n\nThe Stoicism books I’ve read so fare are:\nA Guide to the Good Life - William Irvine\nStoicism and the Art of Happiness by Donald Robertson\nHow to be a Stoic – Massimo Pigliucci\nEnchiridion - Arrian/Epictetus\n\nI’ve also partially read (dipped in and out of):\nMeditations – Marcus Aurelius\nLetter on Ethics - Seneca \nDiscourses - Arrian/Epictetus\n\nI’ve not studied any other philosophies but Stoicism and I consider myself an atheist. My mother is a Christian and I attended church where this was required during school, but I don’t remember ever believing in God or feeling part of the church. I have an irrational and impulsive negative reaction to the whole concept of god so this is something I’ll need to work through during the course.\nI don’t think I consider myself a Stoic. It’s something I would like to be able to consider myself but as yet, I don’t feel that I’ve studied Stoicism deeply enough or have really internalised the concepts sufficiently to do so. I’m also unsure whether my atheism and non-belief in God will ever actually allow me to consider myself a true and complete Stoic. \n\nI’m hoping to get a number of things from this course. I feel that I have only managed to superficially grasp Stoicism so far. This may be because I’ve not studied it with a defined plan but I think that a structured course of study will help me delve deeper and approach things more methodically. All my study to date has been done alone and I feel having a mentor to guide and challenge me as my thoughts and understanding of Stoicism develop will be hugely beneficial. By the end of the course, I really want to have a deeper understanding of stoicism and its concept and to have incorporated Stoicism into my daily life more fully.', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, '', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', 1, 0, '', ''),

Bucher, DNP, RN\r\n2/4/19\r\nMy father, a World War II Veteran, who jumped with the 101st Airborne on D-Day into France, and later was trapped in the Battle of the Bulge at Bastogne, never spoke of his experience, until I was an adult, already working for the Veterans Health Administration. His restrained and dignified approach to his own ‘growing up’ was a large part of his generation’s way of being, of course.  But he also had a quiet and calm demeanor that seemed to stay balanced, despite the vicissitudes of our lives. I admired him so.  This was surely the start of an intuitive understanding of stoicism, before I could name it.  \r\nI was the oldest of four children, born to a family that had a wonderful if modest life. Mom was an RN, with tremendous social intelligence; Dad, geologist for Chevron Oil, was a life-long learner. I grew up in a middle-class home, went to good public schools, had lovely friends, was surrounded by a wide network of family, and traveled with the family every summer for a month, sleeping in an old Army tent, throughout the country.  I worked from the age of 15 and was known as the family risk-taker, due to decisions such as joining the Peace Corps while in my mid-20s.  Since those early years, I have obtained a BSN in Nursing from University of California, San Francisco, MSN from San Diego State, and a doctorate from University of New Mexico, all in Nursing sciences.  I joined the VA in 1986 and have worked up the ladder over the years, at many different VA locations.  Now, I am a few years out from retirement, of which I intend to return to my beloved New Mexico and teach again at the University. \r\nWe have a home in Folsom, California, east of Sacramento, where we live safely behind the progressive curtain.  My husband and I raised two gorgeous girls, one who is a Marriage and Family therapist in Los Angeles and the other, a student in Western Classics at St. John’s College, Santa. Fe, New Mexico. Brett and I met 30 years ago, while establishing the Green Party in San Diego County. We love camping, hiking, and reading; we struggle to eat more vegetables, like everyone else. We are healthy and lucky to be so comfortable.\r\nI have been interested in Stoicism since being introduced to the topic through the St. John’s Sophomore reading list. My daughter Sylvaine was required to read much of Epictetus Discourses.  In order to support her success at school, and to provide myself a broader education too, I have been reading along with her most of her assignments. Epictetus stopped me in my tracks.  \r\nSince then, I have read (twice!)  Massimo Pigliucci’s How to Be a Stoic and Marcus Aurelius Meditations.  I also have consistently been using Ryan Holiday’s Daily Stoic Journal, along with his The Daily Stoic: 366 Meditations on Wisdom, Perseverance, and the Art of Living.  Finally, I took a four-week course last fall from Donald Robertson, called the Stoic Mindfulness and Resilience Training, through the website “Modern Stoicism”.  And of course, I receive wonderful emails from the Daily Stoic. \r\nI would call myself a deist, even though I was raised as an Episcopalian and later studied intensely at Paramahansa Yogananda’s Self-Realization Fellowship for many years.   After recently reading St. Augustine, St. Thomas Aquinas, St. Anselm, and Dante, I am even more shocked by the convoluted ontology of Christian theology.  If anything, I have embraced the mystery and the unknowability of a creator God. Currently, I do not attend or regularly worship in any specific religion although sometimes I yearn for the rituals of Episcopalian practice, as they are comforting still, after so long away.  I try to meditate regularly, which is most likely an essential intervention for those who truly want to become stoic. \r\nI have studied various philosophies during the last 18 months of reading with my daughter. Plato, Sophocles, Aeschylus, Aristotle, etc.  Over the years, my philosophical reading has been predominantly in the vein of eastern or ‘new age’ spiritual thought. My husband, who has a BS in Philosophy from UC Berkeley, has been really helpful in guiding my understanding of some of the tough concepts in ancient Greek philosophy. My family actually sits around the dinner table and talks about virtues, natural law, and even ‘first principles’!  \r\nI consider myself to be a stoic-in-training.  The intellectual clarity of stoicism is one thing; the behavioral changes required to truly detach my expectations about those things which are outside of me, and focus on controlling my emotions, ego, and actions for those things which are inside of me……well, that is the issue, isn’t it? I have opportunity to consider my responses every day, as I am senior executive of a large VA healthcare system in California. There is never an hour that doesn’t offer, as Ram Dass said so beautifully, “grist for the mill”. \r\nConsequently, I want to go deeper.  The Robertson course just whet my appetite for self-reflection and discussion with others about this powerful set of ideas.  In a four-month course, I may have the opportunity (and discipline) to really think through my work, my family life, my future retirement, my health, my pursuits from a stoic perspective. Using both social and individual learning approaches, I want to consider how to apply stoicism and see meaningful personal change.  Finally, I am mulling over an idea about bringing stoicism to a select group of Veterans, in order to help with their very difficult and often tragic circumstances. \r\nIn order to transform, one must be aware of one’s ‘final end’ (thank you, St. Aquinas).   The overriding drive is to never sit back into a slothful self-congratulatory position. I can never stop seeking the answers for living an even more amazing and fulfilled life. It has nothing to do with achievement, although I have nothing to be ashamed of in that category.  It has little to do with my book collection, or my children’s beauty, or my cooking skill (not).  It is about blowing out the cylinders of the machine that has carried me through all these years, too busy as an American worker and bread-winner to ‘know myself’.  There is much more to be done to understand what this is all about; its time to find some wisdom in all the motion. Whether I finally step into politics (free from the gag required under federal service) or focus on raising my grandson to be a good man, I want to do what I do next through conscious efforts to embody goodness and virtue. As stated so eloquently by Epictetus, “What does Socrates say? Just as one person delights in improving his farm, and another his horse, so I delight in attending to my own improvement day by day”.

I have no academic background but have had an ongoing interest in looking to where science and faith unite to offer guidance on the nature of Existence and how we may best exist within it.\n\nMy study of the sciences relevant to metaphysic amounts to reading popular books by scientists and following scientific developments through magazines such as ‘The New Scientist’.  For my study of faith I have looked to the scriptures of the world faiths and have compared them with each other, looking for the common ground.  By about 1989 I had arrived at some ideas about a cosmology that included the need for a ‘Consciousness’ to explain how the Cosmos manifests as it does while also offering a place for ‘God’ in the scheme of things.  Having come to this stage in my study, my question was ‘What next?’  The day after asking this question of myself and the Cosmos I was in a second hand bookshop that I frequented regularly when I was drawn to a dusty little book tucked away almost out of sight at the back of the shelves.  Despite it having clearly been there on my many earlier visits, somehow it had never come to my attention till I had asked ‘What next?’  The book was entitled ‘The Stoic Philosophy’.  It was a record of a lecture in 1915 by Professor Gilbert Murray and it showed me that Zeno had, over two millennia earlier, arrived at the same cosmology that I had (in all but words).  So I studied what we have from Zeno and his fellow Stoics, and now try to ‘live in accord with Nature (Phusis)’ by looking to how the Stoic faith, the Stoic metaphysics and the physics of life offers us a rationale as to how we ought to live life.  In light of this I would class myself as being of the classic school of Stoicism.\n', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', 0, 0, '', ''),

I look forward to hearing from my mentor.', 'My name is Kirtanya. I was born in a remote village in southern India in a Hindu house hold. My parents were small time farmers. \n\nThe numerous festivals dedicated to our pantheon of gods and listening to stories from our two grand Hindu epics are among the most happiest parts of my childhood. Almost all the Hindu philosophical stories dwelled on the complexities of ethics facing human action. While I was too little to understand or follow them, I recollect vividly that they fascinated me very much and laid the foundation for what I would do later on in life. \n\nMy home was most often a place of strife and sickness. And I grew increasingly troubled in my mind as I grew older. I was introduced to christianity in my 7th grade through a teacher who was newly transferred to our village. \n\nHinduism does not have the active concept of ‘prayer\' as much as the passive concept of ‘Karma’. So when I learnt that prayer to Jesus could solve all my problems instantly, I was deeply impressed by the christian god. When my ardent prayers went unheeded, my teacher, enrolled me in a Vacation Bible School. Temporarily influenced by the stories contained in there, I took baptism, defying my livid father’s explicit instructions not to.  \n\nLaughable as it sounds now, within a year of being a Christian, the christian God was quickly kicked out by my Muslim friend, Fatima. She showed me proof that since both my Hindu Gods and Jesus were impotent to solve my problems, it goes to show that ‘Allah’ was the true God. It made a lot of sense to my little mind back then. I started learning how to do ‘Namaz’ from her in the breaks and made sincere efforts to learn Arabic to read Quran in the original. \n\nThese behaviors, both the ardent religious pursuits and defying of authority, were not at all the norm in my small village. It worried my parents immensely.\n\nHowever, my new-found spiritual ardor did not change my character in anyway. I continued to be depressed and aggressive. Very soon, I realized that praying desperately to all the Gods I have taken the pains to get to know, did nothing to stop my living day-lights being thrashed out by my academically ambitious parents. I turned into a full blown atheist then. All of this happened before I turned 14.\n\nAnd soon, the existence of a God or a non-existence didn’t matter one way or the other. I became fascinated and highly distracted with boys. We had shifted to a near by metropolitan city and the culture shock was too much to cope with.\n\nWhen I was 16, I got into frequent fights with my father. In one such fight he had slapped me in front of my neighbors. This single event would change the quality of my spiritual life forever. \n\nI had felt extremely humiliated and hopeless. I cried well into the night and drifted into an uneasy sleep with the firm resolve to kill myself first thing in the morning. I woke up at around 4:30 AM. And something was decidedly different. Even as I came fully awake, I realized that I couldn’t feel my body at all. The moment I recognized that, I felt an explosion of bliss within me and an intense sharpening of perception which grew even more intenser at astronomical speeds in seconds.\n\nWhen it settled, I began feeling every organism, person, animal, trees around me as though they were all parts of me. I was their pain, I was their joy, I was the maggots slithering on the back of a dog that was in my street, I was the dog, I was the tree outside my home, I was the immense stillness and the movement that happened simultaneously with in the tree’s being… Everything was me and I was everything. My being exploded with compassion for every little bit of creation, including my father and myself. But the strangest thing was, the one that was feeling the compassion was not the one that called itself ‘me’.  \n\nThis is the nearest I can sum up that experience with words. I haven’t shared this with many people for fear of being called crazy. \n\nWhen I came back to normalcy after maybe a few minutes or a few hours (I had lost all sense of time), I was a different person. All the pent up anger, shame and grief of the previous evening had vanished without a trace. \n\nI didn’t understand the experience at all, but I did understand that something significant had happened. The immediate effects of the experience waned after a few months. But it would spark in me a craving, an unquenchable thirst to get back to that state of bliss permanently, somehow. (I haven’t had anything even marginally close to the same experience ever again so far).\n\nThe next decade was a crazy one in search of ‘enlightenement.\' I walked several wrong alleys in search of it. The Indian spiritual scene with its various philosophies and charlatan gurus made it all the more complex and led me to innumerable dead-ends along my path. \n\nFor a couple of years, I did Hindu “Tantric" mediations involving ‘Kundalini’ and ‘Chakras’ which was a complete dead end. And then I went into fruit-only diet for a couple of years to cleanse my system and thereby get enlightened. That was a dead end too. Then it was concentration-meditations coupled with psychedelic drugs. That was an utter disaster kind of a dead-end which only messed up my body and head all the more. I could never get back even 1/millionth of the state that I had experienced as a teen through any of these paths.\n\nAll this while, my friends were all getting into cozy jobs, getting married and getting settled, I still had not earned a penny or sustained any meaningful relationship/friendship. In fact I had discontinued my education, cut myself off from friends and family, and refused to be involved in society so that I can pursue what I considered ‘true education’. In hindsight, it was all a cowardly escape from the raw suffering that facing reality entailed. \n\nMy first real break through happened when I became acquainted with the philosophy of J. Krishnamurthy, the Indian Philosopher. It helped me understand that my ‘search’ for enlightenment was the greatest trick played by my mind to rob me of all the joy in the present. His teachings on the nature and structure of the human mind with ‘choiceless awareness’ as the key to break through its games, helped me a lot in getting my bearing back in the real world. \n\nHowever, that was not enough. There were several loop holes which made it all a rather dry philosophy and I was getting my head twisted into knots with all the intellect-only stuff. My progress came to a stand still after the initial advancement.\n\nCoincidentally, I watched a movie on Zen Buddhism around this time. “Why did Bodhi Dharma go east” was so totally and completely un-understandable that my curiosity was piqued. I did research after research on it and landed on the teachings of Thich Nhat Hanh and plunged head long into various other schools of Buddhism. The Buddhist concept of compassion resonated deeply with me. I benefitted immensely from practicing “Vipassana” meditation and still do. My aggressive, depressive and suicidal tendencies came under my control effectively.\n\nWhile all these were happening in my internal world, my external world was in doldrums. I was already 33 years and with not a penny or friend to my name. However, I had gained an immense amount of clarity as to what I wanted to do with my life. \n\nI wanted to make the teachings on the mind available to teen age children. I felt it such a shame that we as a society are neglecting the most important education: emotional literacy coupled with mind-management. In countries like India, we all pay the prices for the choices we make in teen age with our entire lives. That being the case, one would expect that children should be trained in handling the cruelties of life and their minds along with the training to earn a pay check.  But, Nada!! An education in our philosophies or psychology featured nowhere in our curriculum. \n\nSo that’s what I wanted to do that with my life. I wanted to make attempts to rectify that egregious blunder; to provide emotional literacy to kids, with all that I had learnt about the mind. \n\nIn 2012, I started my company MindFresh Training and started conducting psychology and philosophy workshops for children aged 13-18 years and their parents. While initially an up-hill struggle, I soon found out that I had a flair for connecting with young minds and inspiring them to take up self-examination. I have learned something new with every workshop and it has been an immensely fulfilling and happy journey. My work continues to grow everyday.(www.mindfresh.in)  \n\nUntil 2017, I had not travelled to more than 5 cities with in India and never once stepped out of India. I remained very limited in my exposure. My first proper contact with the western world was through a German man I had met in my city quite by chance in 2016. \n\nThe grumpy guy with the western “Independence” culture had views totally alien to my eastern “Inter-dependence” culture. And I found the awkward friendship we had struck tumultuous from the start. It required that I call to the forefront every ounce of self-control I possessed, to see through what appeared to me as intensely ‘selfish’ behaviors, not as an individual trait but as a cultural difference between the east and the west. I am glad I did that, because in him I did find someone I could truly trust, respect and discuss the philosophies with. His western influence provided a lot of intellectual structure to my heart-centered instinctive teachings I delivered in my workshops. \n\nAnd thus began my journey into the western philosophies. \n\nMeanwhile, my work with the kids was slowly gaining prominence and visibility in India. Indian people outside of India started inviting me for workshops in Canada, USA and Kuwait. I was fortunate to travel out of my small well and see how people from other cultures lived their life.  I was surprised to find that the teen aged citizen’s thoughts were being shaped by their popular culture just like my country, without a root into what really matters. \n\nMy German friend introduced me to Nietzsche around this time. All my understanding of the Buddhist compassion was deeply shaken up by Nietszche’s philosophy. I struggled immensely to find arguments against Nietzsche’s world view, as accepting him would mean I burn everything I have always stood for: Being considerate and compassionate to those less privileged than me. \n\nI had read Irwine’s “A guide to the good life” and Robinson’s “Stoicism and the art of Happiness” a bit earlier to Nietzsche. I didn’t think they were very powerful in combatting Nietzsche’s ridicule of compassion as the property of the ‘sheep’ people. With the limited understanding I got from those books, I felt Stoicism was just Buddhism with different nomenclatures and fancy greek names. I didn’t pursue it further. \n\nWhile I did read several criticisms on Nietzsche which helped me get a more balanced view of his philosophy, a gnawing discomfort remained within. \n\nAnd then I started listening to “Stoicism on Fire” by Chris Fisher. And immediately, the difference between Stoicism and Buddhism clicked into place. The Buddha never made any comment on “God”, “Universe”, or the rational nature of the universal Mind. In fact he actively discouraged all such contemplations as irrelevant discussions through parables and pointed the seeker towards concerning themselves only with the cessation of ‘suffering’. \n\nAfter listening to Mr.Fisher, I understood that the “ethics” of the stoics in the light of the providential Universe was very different from the “right living” contained in the “Eightfold path” to Buddhist Enlightenment. The contemplation of “God” that was kicked out of me by my juvenile experiences turning me into an atheist and later an agnostic, came back albeit with greater maturity. I felt I found something that I had been searching all along. It also helped me combat certain elements of Nietzsche’s philosophy. Compassion is not the belonging of the cattle class… but is a duty you do to the larger world around.\n\nI find myself enjoying with delight the stoic God as contemplated by Epictetus and Aurelius. And I believe my next evolution in this beautiful path of self-discovery, can only happen with this divine element figured in. I wish for greater clarity on the rational Universe through a guided authentic study of the ancient stoics. \n\nI would be very grateful if the college of stoic philosophers would consider my humble application and mentor me to find within me, the perspective of the divine as viewed by the great stoics.\n\nBest Regards\nKirtanya\n\nTuition fee Receipt number: 9LP64397SK829331H\n', 1, '2019-10-18', 0, 0, 0, '', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', 0, 0, '', '');

Lundmark\nMarch 14, 2019\nΓΝΩΘΙ ΣΕΑΥΤΌΝ\nSchool of Essential Studies\nAutobiographical Essay\n\n	I was born on March 4, 1985, in Phoenix Arizona. My father was, and is, an attorney, and my mother left work after I was born to devote herself full time to caring for me and, later, my sister. My schooling and upbringing were ordinary. I learned to read early, got in lots of trouble as a student in grade school, enrolled in advanced classes, and generally got good grades.\n	Religion played a powerful role in my childhood and youth. My family attended a conservative “nondenominational Bible church” that had a terrific youth program, in which I participated eagerly until I was in my late teens. I was fortunate in the leadership of this church. The senior pastor had his D. Div. from Cambridge and was bookish, intellectual, and charismatic. He, as well as the youth pastor, always encouraged us to ask questions of our faith, even and especially very difficult ones. After all, if what we believed was true, there would be an answer to even the most difficult questions. Truth should fear nothing.\n	That questioning nature took deep root in me, and as a child and teenager I devoured literature with abandon. Well, that may be an overstatement: in addition to the Bible, I read works on Christian apologetics and, especially, lots and lots of science fiction, which taught me wonder. One of the most influential books I read as a teenager was Ursula K. le Guin\'s The Dispossessed. About a physicist on an anarchist world, it set me to thinking about politics, society, and economics in a way I never considered before. I started delving into literature on anarchism (the classical, communist kind) and was soon convinced that anarchism was in full accord with Christian ethics, as I understood them: the principles of caring for the poor, of resisting injustice, of not dominating others resonated powerfully with me.\n	This interest in anarchism was bound to raise eyebrows among my peers at church, as I was not then very shy about expressing what I thought. This led to a conversation, which, although simple, stands with me to this day as an example of intellectual friendship and charity. While on retreat with my youth group, my senior pastor approached me in a private moment to ask me, in short, what was going on with all the anarchism stuff. I explained as best I could what I thought about it and how it fit with the Christian faith, invoking Tolstoy and whatever other examples came to mind. He listened patiently, asking a few questions. At the end, he smiled and thanked me for explaining it to him, and then suggested that I do some reading on Calvinism and its relationship with capitalism. There was no condemnation, only listening and nudging in the direction he thought I should pursue. (To my discredit, I never followed his suggestions: I was too sure I already had the truth.)\n	Calvinism. That word ultimately spelled the doom of my youthful Christian faith. Somehow, my youth group had become infected with a long-running debate between Calvinist double-predestination and an Arminianism which allowed free will. This seemed to be a question of no small importance to me, as the Calvinist position struck me as cruel and monstrous. What kind of God would create a man with the sole purpose of damning him? Surely that had to be false, and Arminianism correct. But I knew that, just because one alternative was more attractive, it was not thereby true. So, I agonized for months over this question, studying the Bible, talking with pastors, reading other books. Even when I tried to put the question aside, it kept coming back: predestination or free will? Cruelty or kindness?\n	The more I read, the more I became convinced that the Calvinists had the better of the argument. Finally, during one conversation with friends from church, the topic came up, and I made my decision: “Predestination is a doctrine of hate. It is also the biblically justified doctrine. I will choose love.” My apostasy sounded grand in my head, although I\'m not sure anyone else around me even noticed.\n	Unfortunately for me, the choice of love over hate (at least as I understood it at age 16 or 17) created rather more problems. After all, I still believed that the Bible was the Word of God and was, therefore, infallibly true. I just wanted no part of it. Thus, I lived in a strange kind of limbo, where I lived in opposition to what I believed to be true, because what I believed to be true I found abhorrent.\n	Sometimes I wonder if my departure from my youthful Christianity owed less to these grand intellectual and theological controversies and more to my cultivation of an immoral lifestyle. After all, in high school I started smoking cigarettes and marijuana, I drank alcohol occasionally, and I entered a disastrous sexual relationship with a girl. Could those moral choices have occasioned my departure from the faith? I am strongly inclined to say no. I was perfectly willing to accept that something could be true, no matter how much I didn\'t want it to be. I was interested in truth for its own sake, and not for the sake of justifying the life I wanted to lead.\n	That said, it is hard to maintain a contradiction for long, and with time, my “believing unbelief” transformed into a general agnostic theism. I couldn\'t imagine there being no God: the philosophical proofs were just too good! But it came to seem less important that God be identified with the God of the Bible, with whom I had grown up. \n	My political engagement continued unabated during this period, and I suppose I found in anarchism a surrogate religious faith. With the decline of my native faith, however, the replacement grew increasingly bitter. I came to reject my initial Tolstoyan pacifism and adopted a generalized advocacy of insurrectionary violence along with a skepticism toward most forms of “activism,” which struck me as privileged, narcissistic, and ineffectual.\n	After high school, I attended Pomona College in Claremont, California. College saw some radical shifts in my life, both intellectually and morally. Morally, I became a wreck: I began using copious amounts of drugs, became increasingly unsociable, and generally lost much of what had made me a happy, outgoing person in my younger years. Intellectually, however, college was a game-changer. I became an avowed atheist almost out the gate: a friend loaned me a book by Richard Dawkins, and I was swept away by his withering rebukes of “bronze-age gods.” Empirical science had done away with the need for God, I believed, and, besides, all those arguments I thought proved the existence of God turned out not to hold much water, anyway.\n	On entering college, I intended to study history, which had been my favorite subject in high school. This, happily, was not to be. My second semester at school, I enrolled in an extremely lousy history class and in an extremely interesting course in Ancient Philosophy. I was immediately hooked. There was something compelling about the ethical writings of Plato and, especially, Aristotle: a recipe for ethics and goodness that rested on reason and not on religious faith. More than this: it wasn\'t simply a recipe for good behavior, but rather for eudaimonia, for a flourishing human life. I devoted the rest of my college career to studying philosophy, with a focus on ancient Greek philosophy and Aristotle\'s ethics in particular. Virtue ethics seemed more fully human to me than its deontological or consequentialist competitors. I was convinced that Aristotle had captured a truth that was necessary to my happiness.\n	One great consequence of studying philosophy was that I was almost completely depoliticized. I retreated into a realm of abstract arguments and did not make much time for my anarchist convictions. By the time I graduated, after various experiences, none important here, I had renounced my surrogate religion, too. My time was better spent translating Greek and Latin literature and pondering the nuances of the Nicomachean Ethics.\n	Of course, my own shabby personal moral life meant that I did not reap many fruits from my philosophical studies. I struggled powerfully with the existential angst of youth, and I was haunted by the absence of the God who had once been the source of all meaning in my life. I\'m not sure if I really wanted God to exist—it probably depended on the day. But I was convinced he couldn\'t. As the years went by, especially after I graduated and lost the structure of student life (to fast forward briefly), I especially mourned the lack of a center in my life, the lack of a motive to overcome my moral torpor and become a functional, virtuous adult. I thought that if I had a God, I could do anything. After all, if an omnipotent, omnibenevolent being exists, why wouldn\'t you do anything you could for Him? I never read anything by Sartre, but I stumbled upon a quote from him that succinctly summarized my own view at the time: “God doesn\'t exist. The bastard.”\n	My reflexive and arrogant atheism suffered some knocks, however. The most significant was from a professor in a course on Jewish Mysticism, which friends had encouraged me to take. After reading the material for the first week, I became frustrated with the repeated references to God. I was convinced that “God” was an absurdity, a contradiction in terms, something that could not only not exist but could not even be coherently thought. So, I approached my professor after class and told her I was having trouble making sense of all the God talk. The word “God,” I explained, seemed to be merely a placeholder word because the writer didn\'t know what he was talking about. The professor looked at me with much greater patience than I deserved. “Yes,” she explained, “\'God\' is a placeholder. Your job as a reader is to figure out what the writer is pointing toward by using that word.” No surprise, but 19-year-old me had never thought of that before, and I took the matter under advisement.\n	My penchant for “dangerous” reading continued while I was in college. This time, it took the form of reading articles of a conservative Catholic periodical. My readings in Aristotle had, it seems by necessity, led me to an interest in Catholicism. The Catholic Church, as far as I could tell, was the only body that really took a practical (as opposed to merely theoretical) interest in virtue ethics today. As I understood things, the Church had adopted Aristotle via Aquinas and was happily encouraging its members to cultivate the moral and intellectual virtues. This was intriguing, even though I was sure the Church was wrong about God, and about most of its countercultural moral stances, such as on sexual issues.\n	Nevertheless, I was drawn to the beauty of the Catholic Church. Not only the beauty of her art and architecture and liturgy, although that was there, but especially the beauty of her intellectual heritage. I could not help admitting that a great number of men who were far wiser than I had believed that God existed—I felt a little presumptuous—parochial, even—imagining that I had some kind of wisdom that these earlier sages had lacked. Nevertheless, I couldn\'t bring myself to believe. God simply couldn\'t exist, no matter how much I might want him to. I visited the resident priest on campus several times, and he graciously met with a bedraggled, scrawny student reeking of cigarettes and worse. But I could not commit. The Church might be Beautiful, and she might even be Good, but I could not except that she was True.\n	To cut to the chase, I did ultimately become a Catholic several years after my graduation in 2007. I had moved back in with my parents in Phoenix, was working at Starbucks, and was spending most of my free time smoking weed, drinking beer, and hanging out with friends. It was a great way to use a $160,000 degree.\n	One Sunday morning, I found myself with a powerful desire to go to Mass. I had just come out of some rough personal situations, and I was feeling lost. So, I went and had an emotionally overwhelming experience. That day, or shortly thereafter, I knew I either had to pursue my interest in Catholicism seriously or abandon in permanently. I had flirted long enough: it was time to ask the girl out or leave her alone altogether. So, still not believing in God, I enrolled in a class for potential converts.\n	The precise progression of my conversion is not the easiest for me to describe. I will accordingly condense it into three stages: first, credo quia absurdum (G.K. Chesterton helped); second, perhaps realizing the first was insufficient, ad quem ibimus?; third, and finally, credo ut intellegam. Please pardon the opacity of this description. To some extent, all three of these stages remain present with me to this day. Ultimately, converting was less a matter of assenting to true propositions than it was a matter of falling in love.\n	As expected, the Church provided a crash course on practical ethics. But, to my surprise, it wasn\'t as easy as I thought it would be. I had no “road to Damascus” moment, and I was not instantly transformed into a virtuous soul. The sacraments were not magic, and I had lots of work to do.\n	The path of virtue, which I came to see also as the path of holiness, was long, slow, and difficult. I had lots of baggage and bad habits from my past, which I was not able to simply slough off all at once. It is discouraging to bring the same sins to confession week after week, month after month, year after year. And let me tell you: Catholic guilt is a real thing. When I find that I have slipped into a state of mortal sin, that can often enough to send me spiraling into despair and wallowing in my vices for days or even months before resolving to do penance and make amends. But at least I’m trying to do better, which is more than I could say about myself earlier. \n	In addition to the above, my “external” life started moving again. After laboring as a barista for two and a half years, I realized I was never going to apply to graduate school. So, I took the LSAT and prepared to apply to law school, which was easier because it didn’t require a writing sample. Just after I sat for the exam, however, I was offered a teaching position at a classical liberal-arts charter school. That sounded much better than law school, and I accepted. For the next four years, I taught Latin and Medieval History, primarily to junior high students. I loved being back in an academic environment. The school actively discouraged any references to pop culture both inside and outside the classroom, and I had many searching conversations with faculty and students alike about philosophy, art, history, and religion. I was happy, and I thought I would make teaching my career.\n	But I did not reckon with the next big change in my life: marriage. I met my wife at church, and after a two-year courtship, we were married. In true Catholic fashion, our first child was born nine months after our wedding. My wife is not like me. In fact, it would be hard to find someone whose upbringing was less like mine. She is the oldest of 11 children, was raised Catholic, and was home-schooled through high school. She never attended college, and her father is resolutely anti-intellectual (needless to say, he did not, and does not, like me). She is full of practical skills, disciplined, and has a no-nonsense approach to getting things done. Her work ethic and personal morality puts me to shame.\n	My marriage therefore has been a great spur to try to tame my vices. For one thing, my wife does not let me get away with much bullshit. Furthermore, the responsibilities of family life have made me more conscientious of my duties. I now have three children, with a fourth almost here. When I see them, I am overwhelmed with love and a deep sense of how unfit I am to raise children. My family thus provides external sources of motivation for right action that are difficult to ignore.\n	Of course, my wife’s and my profoundly different backgrounds have proved a fertile source of strife, particularly when it comes to child-rearing decisions. It is too easy for my passions to overwhelm my reason. Often, I do violence to my own objectives by failing to act and speak with prudence.\n	When my wife was pregnant with our first child, I realized that I could not support a child on a teacher’s salary, and, just before my LSAT score expired, I applied to law school. Three years later, in 2017, I took a J.D. from the University of Arizona James E. Rogers College of Law. I am now a practicing attorney, an associate at a law firm specializing in product-liability defense. As an attorney, I am accountable for how I spend my time and use my mind in a way that I have never been before. I enjoy the intellectual rigor of legal analysis, although the subject matter is far more mundane—dare I say boring?—than philosophy or theology.\n	I suppose I should finally say something about Stoicism.\n	I mentioned my somewhat counter-productive experiences with relying on religious devotion to grow in virtue. One serious slip, and it can be hard for me to lift my eyes to the Cross or to ask, again, the mercy of God. Far easier just to keep sinning. While emotionally and spiritually estranged from the Church, I find it easier to look elsewhere for possible solutions to my maladies that didn’t require as much emotional investment. Buddhist meditation has had great appeal. Confucian ethics are profound and inspiring. I need something to help me grow in natural virtue, to preserve a certain equanimity, even in the face of mortal sin. (I hasten to add that I do not impugn the Church or the sacraments: I do not mean that I am above their help, but that perhaps I am below it. Grace builds on nature, and my nature is poorly formed.)\n	This is where Stoicism comes in. One day, while I was feeling sorry for myself and frustrated with my inability to overcome my vices, I remembered the opening lines of the Enchiridion, which a college friend had shared with me many years ago. “Some things are up to us, and some things are not up to us.” I was inspired—there is no other word—to look up the text of Epictetus’s work. Immediately, I found practical, sage advice that cut through all my misery and excuses. I spent my spare time over the next month transcribing the Greek text of the Enchiridion into my journal, translating as I went. Along with the practical wisdom I was acquiring, it was a pleasure to use Greek again, which I have had few opportunities for since I left college.\n	I next discovered Chris Fisher’s Stoicism on Fire podcast. I binge listened to all the available episodes while I was reading the Enchiridion, and I started to apply the Stoic disciplines to my life. These were practical techniques I could apply that were devoid of the religious baggage that so often disturbed my emotions and my conscience. Did I get drunk yesterday? Did I commit some other grievous fault? Yes—but that is in the past and beyond my power to change. It does not affect my present ability to apply the dichotomy of control, or the disciplines of assent, desire, and action.\n	Over the next few months, I consistently applied the Stoic disciplines as I understood them, while maintaining a consistent regime of mindfulness meditation and physical exercise. I was amazed at the results. I was happier and more content than I had been in a long time, and I had gone for longer without falling into old vices than I could remember.\n	A beginner’s progress cannot continue unabated, and mine did not. Problems arose at home and at work that I was not prepared to deal with, and I slacked off on the above disciplines. My bad habits returned. But I knew that I had hit on something that could serve as a guide.\n	I learned about the College of Stoic Philosophers from Chris Fisher’s podcast. I am specifically interested in the College, and in particular the School of Essential Studies, because I want to learn about, and be accountable for practicing, the disciplines that can lead to growth in virtue. Practical ethics is the primary reason I am applying to this course.\n	In addition, I hope to find an academically rigorous environment, where I can learn in a structured fashion about Stoic physics and logic, which I find independently interesting. I don’t expect to adopt Stoic physical dogmas. I remain a committed Catholic, even if a bad one. I also remain an Aristotelian at heart. The Angelic Doctor and The Philosopher both rule out materialism. I have fewer initial objections to Stoic determinism. Maybe that makes me a heterodox Catholic, with a lingering Calvinist influence (my youthful objections to the supposed “cruelty” of Calvin’s system no longer seem so persuasive). Essentially, I’m a compatibilist, and I can’t make much sense of free will without at least some kind of determinism.\n	I don’t necessarily consider myself a Stoic, although I am happy to call myself a prokopton. I may never be as virtuous as Socrates, but that doesn’t mean I shouldn’t strive to make progress in virtue. I will never be as rich as Croesus or as strong as Milo, but I of course take care of my wealth and my body. And if I can care for these things, which God can take from me at any moment, how can I fail to care for that which is entirely in my own power: my will?\n', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, '', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', 0, 0, '', ''),

In this small town of no more than 25,000 inhabitants, I was raised in the first three years of life by my maternal grandparents, both teachers for the municipality. From them I inherited simplicity, an appreciation for kindness, a good sense of humor, and a pleasure for reading. I was then brought, together with my mother, to the life of a big city in Santo André, where my father had gotten a job and obtained enough income for our family life. My birth had been unforeseen and my parents young, in their early twenties.\n\nMy childhood was not at all easy, but with a positive balance. Emotionally, many roller coasters and conflicts between my parents. I was enrolled in a Catholic college, where I stayed from 5 to 14 years old, with constant religion classes and beginning of my philosophical reflections. The approach of the nuns was dogmatic and often threatening: we saw pictures of aborted children, watched videos about the secrets of Fatima and about the end of the world, and many lectures on sin and repentance. As a result, I became a militant young atheist, and at the age of 13 I was part of the first digital society of atheists, called the "The Round Earth Society", tone of the very first communities established on the Brazilian Internet landscape. By this time I had my first contact with philosophical classics, through Socrates, Plato, Descartes and Nietzsche, especially the latter, who tends to flirt with adolescents and those with rebellious nature.\n\nBecause of my father\'s participation in Freemasonry, some strange books filled his bookshelf. At 15, one of them called my attention: "Introduction to the Mystical Kabbalah". From this a long sequence of readings begun and many improbable connections I ended up associating myself with an esoteric order, called A.`.A.`., in which I participated from 16 to 20 years. But magic and mysticism aggravated my melancholic tendencies and propensity to have my "head in the clouds." I ended up getting involved with people on the margin of society, my enthusiasm for everyday life declined, and my conditions generally worsened. Too much for my metaphysical nonconformity and sense of social inadequacy. \n\nShortly after graduating in Business Administration, I was approved and enrolled for 6 months in the Philosophy course at the University of São Paulo, the most prestigious in the country. I ended up giving up because I was in the worst of emotional conditions, and the college was, then, much more a factory of ideologists (especially Marxists) than a cradle of free thinkers. I had only the opportunity to briefly study modern philosophy.\n\nAt 22, more stabilized, working, I started my participation in a meditation center of Tibetan origin, looking for a spiritual path that was simpler, more rational and connected to the earth. I actively participated in it, starting as a student and becoming a meditation instructor and eventually director of the center in São Paulo. I have done many studies, courses and retreats in the teachings of the three main schools of Buddhism - Hinayana, Mahayana and Vajrayana. It was a very beneficial period. However, after 11 years of regular practice at age 33, I came across the need for the "samaya vow", through which the student devotes himself entirely to the guru and delves into more "mystical" practices. It was enough for a new rupture - I did not want to bring the esoteric complexity back into my life, and the course of the tradition to which I was a part did not go well. Today, the international leadership faces difficulties with serious allegations of sexual abuse and abuse of power, which have come down to the pages of the New York Times. The problems with spiritual institutions then turned out in a very classical way: there is a point where the concern is much greater to keep one\'s institution alive or growing than to ensure that the teachings are transmitted with care and precision.\n\nAnd so this brief account reaches the present day. I am a 35-year-old man, father of two children: a 16-year-old young adult of my wife\'s first marriage (living with us since he was 3-years old), and another 6-year-old, my biological son. I am happily married to a woman of noble and modest heart, beautiful in every way. I studied many religions and philosophies, and the incessant intellectualities and symbolisms are already enough for me. I do not have need for them to live a good life. My interest is to live in a simple and ennobled way, being able to transmit to my children and loved ones a way of living that brings meaning and adequate structures to their flourishing and human experience. Something that is also compatible with our contemporary life – a rock among stormy seas.\n\nStoicism arose out of total chance by studying about ancient Greece and presented itself as a promise of a spiritually rich but autonomous life. All its fundamental concepts were already "accepted" by me and were part of my life, but not in a structured way. The Stoic philosophy also attracted me by the possibility of continuing philosophically reflecting on life in practical and immediate terms with people of similar interests. Today my intellectual path is extremely lonely.\n\nI hope with my participation in this course to achieve both objectives: depth in study and friendship with fellow travelers. As an additional note, I consider myself today a theist with no formal bond with any religion. I despise fanaticism, idolatry, prejudice, and the excess of certainties. I appreciate Goodness, Beauty, Justice, Freedom and the sacredness of the individual. I also welcome constructive doubt, which brings growth to the Soul.\n\nI conclude by listing relevant Stoic works I have already studied:\n\n• Meditations, by Marcus Aurelius\n• Stoicism Today: Selected Writings (Vol. 1), by Patrick Ussher\n• On the shortness of life, by Seneca\n• Enchiridion, by Epictetus\n\nThank you for your attention I am at your disposal for any clarifications you may need.\n\nSincerely,\nLucas Santacruz\n', 1, '2019-08-26', 0, 0, 0, '', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', 0, 0, '', ''),

As a teenager, I read Mere Christianity and Surprised by Joy by C. S. Lewis to try to understand the beliefs behind the Anglican Church.  When I was in my early 20\'s, I attended a fundamentalist bible college for a few months to try to experience a more visceral brand of Christianity.  But in the end, I could not accept the magical doctrines about creation, angels, prayer and life after death. I wish that there were a benevolent Power guiding events but wishing does not make it true.  I still try to use Jesus\'  teaching about what is important in life as a guide.  The principles he taught seem completely compatible with Stoicism too.\n	In secondary school, I worked very hard and was able to get into Canada\'s Royal Military College.  It was an adventure and I met some strong friends but after a year I was released as not being the kind of leader they were seeking.  I was devastated because I had worked hard and it was the first major setback in my life.  \n	I went on to the University of Toronto and earned a bachelor degree in civil engineering.  During my time at the military college, I had been smitten by a longing for action and excitement. Unfortunately, civil engineering is as dry as dust.  I forced myself to finish my degree but it was so distasteful that I developed emotionally based stomach problems.\n	During my time at university, I had gotten married and had a son,  As graduation approached, I tried to imagine a career that was active but would still let me have a home life and that was not engineering.  Although I had never considered it before I joined the Toronto city police as a compromise and that was my career for 33 years. I still consider it the luckiest day of my life when I joined. It has been tremendously fulfilling.\n	Parts of my police training turned out to be morally degrading.  Some instructors made it clear that we were expected to lie to help convict criminals, to use more force than necessary to cow them and lie again to cover it all up.  It was presented to us as being necessary to protect society since the mechanisms of trials and courts were too feeble.  I am ashamed to say that I accepted this outlook uncritically.   After my expulsion from military college, I was eager to be accepted at my new job.  Probably if I had balked back then, I would have been fired from the police as well.  I understand now how it was possible for the German government to recruit and train concentration camp guards etc.  I doubt that it would be difficult in any society.\n	Over the years, I saw that so much lying and misconduct destroyed the public\'s trust in the police service.  I comprehended that only a couple of hundred officers were on duty at one time, particularly on weekends and at night.  How could we possibly hope to control 2 million people without their trust?  The problem was becoming acute in minority communities. \n	I started reading biography and history to gain insight into how great men in the past had reacted to life\'s challenges.  One incident was particularly revealing:  In what is now Montana, in  1876, a force of 700 United States Cavalry were defeated and all killed by a band of thousands of Sioux warriors.  This battle is well known as Custer\'s Last Stand after the leader of the U.S. forces who was killed there.  What is less well known is that those thousands of Sioux warriors and their families crossed into Canada after the battle to escape a vengeful U.S. Army.  \n	The Canadian government did not have any soldiers in western Canada.  Instead, the Canadian government sent one North West Mounted Police officer to meet the Sioux at the border.  The N.W.M.P. had been on the plains of Canada for several years and had earned a reputation for fairness and justice among the native population.  The single police officer explained to the Sioux that if they obeyed the law and were peaceful then they were welcome to seek refuge in Canada.  Incredibly, the Sioux submitted because they trusted that officer and went on to live peacefully in Canada.  Several years later, again that one police officer, on instructions from the Canadian government, told them that they would have to leave Canada.  The Sioux went back to The U.S.A. peacefully. Essentially, trust and integrity were more powerful than the armed might of 700 soldiers.  It resonated with me particularly because of the policing aspect.\n	I was promoted to supervisor in due time.  By this time, I had realized that the instructors from my training were wrong.  I had seen in so many of my own experiences and in my reading that the misconduct that they espoused worked against the true objectives of the police service.  I also observed how it leaked into the attitudes and degraded the personal lives of so many of my colleagues.  I began to model the ethical behavior I now believed in.  I encouraged my colleagues to follow suit and I insisted that the men and women whom I supervised adhere to high standards.  Serendipitously, the police service also was undergoing a change in corporate culture that supported my efforts. \n		Histories that I read were: \nCaesar: Life of a Colossus, by Adrian Goldsworthy\nAugustus: Rome\'s First Emperor by  Anthony Everitt\nCicero: The Life and Times of Rome\'s Greatest Politician by  Anthony Everitt\nThe Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire by Edward Gibbon\n	I realized that these ancient Romans possessed a better understanding of human nature than almost anyone today.  It is hard to think of anyone modern with their stature.  I also noticed that if they were not actually Stoics themselves, they admired Stoic philosophers such as Marcus Brutus.  It made me curious and motivated to learn more about Stoicism.\n	During my 20\'s, feelings like anger and discouragement that I had been able to suppress or ignore during the scramble to finish school and establish a career began to surface more uncomfortably.  I went to a therapist who had me read A Guide to Rational Living by Albert Ellis et al.  I realize that now those techniques would be called Cognitive Behavior Therapy.  The therapist showed me how to do exercises to apply the techniques in the book and I have used them since then to try and handle troublesome feelings. I began to investigate Stoicism because both CBT and Stoicism seemed to have the same central idea of looking at situations from a perspective of objectivity.  I hoped that reading about Stoicism and interacting with other Stoics would enrich my understanding. \n	While researching Stoicism, I learned about the Stoicon Conference in Toronto in 2018.  I attended and found that what the presenters were saying was in total accord with my beliefs. I am enrolling in this course because I would like a more thorough knowledge of Stoic Philosophy so that I can apply it to my life.\n	I raised 4 children. As they were growing up, I thought about what were the most important and best things that I could do to help prepare them for their lives.  I decided to try to be guided by what would be the best for their spiritual growth.  I wish that I had been more aware of Stoic teachings during those years so that I could have had a clearer guide.  Now there are 7 grandchildren and I hope Stoic teachings will allow me to benefit them too.\n\nTo answer the specific questions in the SES Application:\n1) I have been curious about Stoicism for at least 25 years.\n2) I have not read any books specifically about Stoic Philosophy.\n3) I would call myself an atheist.\n4) I am not a member of a religious faith. However, I have many friends who are Quakers and others who are Fundamentalist Christians.  I admire the Mennonites for their work towards World Peace and charity.\n5) I have not studied any philosophies other than Christian religious instruction.\n6) I am trying to practice Stoicism in my life.\n7) After taking this course, I hope to be able to implement Stoicism in my life more fully.  I am also hoping that with more thorough knowledge, I will be able to introduce the concepts to friends and family.\n\n	\n	\n', 1, '2019-11-10', 1, 0, 0, '', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 'Mark temporarily left the program for the summer term 2020 after completing the Logic portion.

I will divide this essay into three sections: in the first one I will describe my general life and background in terms of knowledge and experiences, in the second I will talk about two major events that occurred this year that increased my desire in learning more and applying Stoicism to my life and in the third section I will talk what I expect from the course and what I can offer to it too.\n\nI am the oldest of two brothers (my young brother is 5 year younger than me) and I had lived almost my entire live (except for the last two years) with my father and mother. Some aspects of my personality where consistent trough my childhood until now, such as curiosity, a more intellectual inclination than physical one (in terms of activities and skills) and a kind of introversion (I have a big difficulty with small talk and talking to new people, but in groups, especially small ones, where I know most of the people I tend to talk a lot). As a child, I liked to read, play videogames and boardgames and those hobbies continue to be my favorites now. The skill that I was most recognized trough my entire life is my intelligence, as I had always been the best student in class and done great on tests and discussions. As I’m very curious, I were interested in all kinds of subjects in school, but I had a preference for Math and Physics. I graduated in college in Production Engineering (a course that combine Engineering with business notions) and after it I finished a master’s degree in Machine Learning (an area that combines Math with programming). Today I work as a Data Scientist in a local IT consulting company.\n\nIn terms of religion, I was created in a Catholic family, being baptized as an infant and passing trough the process of confirmation in the early adolescence. I had also spent my first 10 years of school in a Catholic school. Although all this Catholic environment, my family were not significantly involved in the local religious community, so I never had much restrictions in terms of practice and thought because of religion. Gradually, as I read more about science and philosophy, I started to question those religious beliefs and one of the landmarks was in College when I read the God Delusion by Richard Dawkins and officially identified myself as an atheist.  \n\nTalking a little more about my personality, one of the keys aspects of it is that I love to learn new things and to learn more of what I already have learned. This behavior occurs also in leisure activities (like watching NFL or playing videogames), as I have a tendency to try to learn and read more about the theoretical side of it to fully enjoy it. One significant part of my personality is that I really like to engage in deep discussions (independent of the subject), but this is counterbalanced by my inability of engaging in small talk or more mundane subjects. I also have a major difficulty of speaking about my feelings, even with people closer to me. Related to this, I avoid conflicts at all costs and become very anxious when I must enter in conversations even barely related to it, like asking for a job raise or complaining to someone about their job or service. Finally, I have a calm personality, I’m rarely angry and I like to help and especially teach people about some subject I know about. \n\nAlthough I had some classes of philosophy on high-school, my first contact with Stoicism came later. During College, the company I worked at the time as an intern had a group where they read and discussed selected books (most of the books were more business oriented, but there were some related to philosophy and general discussions). In one of the first meeting of the group we discussed the classes of Clóvis de Barros Filho, a Brazilian philosopher famous for popularizing philosophy concepts and thinkers by using humor and examples of daily life. The specific classes we watched on Youtube were a course on Ethics, containing the Greeks (mostly Plato and Aristotle), Machiavelli, Kant, Nietzche and John Stuart Mill. Although the classes don’t explicitly mention the Stoics, in one of the discussions one of the participants mentioned the Stoic Week and some Stoic practices and this had sparked my interest and made me go online to learn more.\n\nThis first discovery of Stoicism was in 2015 and since them I had been active in learning more about Stoicism, by reading books, internet articles and by talking with friends about it. My first major source of learning was Daily Stoic emails and posts [1] and the Stoic Week exercises and material, but I had also read Donald Robertson’s Stoicism and the Art of Happines and William Irvine’s A Guide to the Good Life. Last year I had also read the Discourses of Epictetus (Robin Hard translation), Marcus Aurelius Meditations (translated by Gregory Hays) and The Inner Citadel by Pierre Hadot. Gradually my understanding of Stoicism was expanded, starting from viewing Stoicism most as “life-hacks” to have a life free of anxiety and worries, to recognizing the fundamental importance of Virtue and the Ethic system and finally, in the present moment, to being interested in the whole system of Ethics, Logic and Physics. \n\nI had also been a member of the Stoicism Group in Facebook (a group created and moderated by Donald Robertson) and a member of New Stoa since 2016. On two occasions (2016 and 2017) I created a small presentation to present Stoicism to my closest colleagues at work and last year I organized a group of people in the company I was working that participate and had daily lunch-time discussions about the Stoic Week. I love to do this kind of activity because my love of teaching and also because by sharing and discussing I learn more about Stoicism. \n\nIn terms of general philosophy, I had some knowledge about Taoism, starting from the Taoist Lectures audios [2] and then reading some books about it: The Spirit of Zen and TAO: The Watercourse Way by Alan Watts and The Path by Michael Puett and Christine Gross-Loh. I have also have some notions about the general historical flow of philosophy (in terms of the main philosophers and theories), especially related to Ethics. Recently I tried to learn more about Virtues Ethic (because of the relation to Stoicism) by reading After Virtue by Alastair MacIntyre (which I didn’t fully understood) and last month I started to read Aristotle Nicomachean Ethics. Finally, last week I started to listen to the History of Philosophy without any gaps podcast [3] and I’m currently in the Presocratics section. \n\nRecently I decided to learn more about Stoicism and specially to practice it in my daily life (which has been a intention for some quite time but never a full commit). The first event that caused this was my change of job in January, which for some work and career related reasons led me to fell a great amount of anxiety about my future, more than any period of my life. This had the effect of showing me that although I’m somewhat acquainted with Stoic principles, I’m not living the live of a Stoic Philosopher. The other major event is that I recently get a divorce from my wife (she was my girlfriend for 8 years and my wife for almost 2 years, so that was a significant change). She was my only girlfriend in life, so she had a large influence on who I am today, and now I have the need to reinvent and define myself independently, and I want to use this opportunity to become a Stoic practitioner.\n\nThe first thing that led me to the Schools of Essential Studies was reading the What is Ancient Philosophy book by Pierre Hadot. This showed me that Stoicism (and other Hellenistic schools) were more than a theoretical framework, but a way of life that required commitment and some specific life changes. Also, in that book I learned that most of the original Stoic teaching were done by a mentor-student system, so the mentor could personalize and guide the student in his practice. The second reference was finding the Stoicism on Fire podcast [4] and the related Traditional Stoicism movement. Listening to the first two episodes I had identified myself a lot with the author, because I had also discarded the Stoic view on Physics and its religion aspects because of my secular view, without trying to give it a shot and understanding it before fully rejecting it (or accepting it). Listening to this podcast I also found the Schools of Essential Studies and reading more about it, it appeared to me as the right thing I was looking for and need at the moment (especially because of the mentor aspect of it).\n\nDoing this course, I expect to learn more systematically about Stoicism and how it relates and could be practiced in my daily life by studying the material, doing the reflections and engaging in discussion with my mentor. I intend to dedicate myself fully to it and to study daily, using all opportunities to learn more and grow. After finishing it, I intend to stop and reflect to define if Stoicism is indeed the correct choice for my life. If so, I intend to apply for the Marcus Aurelius School and eventually become a mentor and help to spread Stoicism in Brazil.\n\nREFERENCES\n\n[1] - https://dailystoic.com/\n[2] - http://www.danielebolelli.com/downloads/taoist-lectures/\n[3] - https://historyofphilosophy.net/\n[4] - http://www.traditionalstoicism.com/what-is-stoicism-on-fire-episode-1/\n', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, '', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', 0, 0, '', '');

For a long while skateboarding was my main release of energy and my escape from the hardships my household held. At a young age I developed some issues with my spine and several of my other joints. This made skateboarding difficult, and then nearly impossible for me. This newfound sedentary lifestyle quickly led to depression. As religion was never a part of my family or my upbringing, I needed to establish another way to redirect and build my life. I found this direction through music. Guitar, drums, keyboard, and general songwriting became my entire life throughout the remainder of my middle and high school years. \n\n	At some point I learned to love the physical issues I had been dealing with. The rest of my family has medical issues that are far more extreme. My sister can hardly leave our house without almost dying from her allergies, and my Mother hasn’t been able to sleep more than a few hours each night for almost 10 months as of now. My unpredictable day-to-day pains forced me to become adaptable and made me truly love every day that I felt anything other than terrible. Fortunately, after a few years, my issues faded away. I am now healthier than ever before and can do things I only dreamed of previously. On top of the medical issues which affect my family, there were a lot of other factors that held them back. A generally unstable environment led to divorce and my father going to prison. Myself and my sisters will never see him again- which is the best outcome, all things considered. My childhood yielded a strong ability to deal with and accept hardship.\n\n	Not long after high school, things became fairly rough between my mother and I for a while. I ultimately ran away and went to live on my oldest sister’s couch for a few months. During this time, my relationship of two years came to an abrupt end, a shoulder injury I had been dealing with for almost a year started worsening again, and, most importantly, I realized that I had to change myself if I was to make it through life in a healthy way. After eight consecutive days of laying on the floor and crying I forced myself up and into the bathroom. I looked at myself in the mirror and said, “No. You aren’t allowed to do this to yourself. Figure it out.” This is the day my life changed. \n\n	The next day I somehow read something about Taoism and realized that I agreed with a lot of what I had read. I also realized I hadn’t really been living in accordance with any of it, but I had known these things ever since I was a child. It was reassuring to see that other people thought similar things as I did. I started trying to meditate and read more and pay attention myself and my life. I didn’t realize how many ups and downs were inbound for me. The only thing I knew was that I now had some sort of beginning of a better direction for myself. My whole life had been littered with examples of what not to do but I had never been shown what I should do instead. \n\n	Fast forward a bit; the basics of Taoism had become a vague guiding light for me but I never really delved too far into it. I had been working at my family business for almost three years at this point, selling t-shirts and other music merchandise both retail and wholesale. It was a great job objectively speaking. It was nice to have some money for the first time in my life (though I was irresponsible with it). However, once I started considering the implications of my existence I quickly figured out how morally unfulfilling it was. It felt like a massive waste of time that created far too much garbage. After a few months of trying to figure out what to do instead of being stuck in a dusty warehouse to pay bills until I died, it hit me. I needed to reconnect with nature. I had to become more like I was as a child- unfettered by judgments and expectations and much closer to the natural world around me. \n\n	December 2016, I was scrolling through Facebook on a Saturday morning. An advertisement showed up for Stoicism, for some reason. I had no idea what it was, so I decided to look it up. Immediately I knew I had to learn more about it. It was a similar feeling to when I read up on Taoism. It felt like I finally had started to find an avenue to organize and cultivate things that I had known my whole life. Feeling inspired, I enrolled in an online school and spent the next year or so getting a diploma in Forestry/Wildlife Conservation. Next thing I know, it’s April 2018 and I am heading out the door to drive across the entire country to work in Idaho doing wilderness trail crew projects for five months. My first project was an eight-week immersion trip in the Frank Church River of No Return Wilderness Area- a 2.4-million-acre expanse of pure wild. This was my first backpacking experience and it changed my life. It was a wonderful test of some of the Stoic principles I had incorporated into my life and was a wonderful display of the need for consistent attention and review. I started reading “Letters From a Stoic” during this trip, and have been very slowly making my way through it ever since. I also read “Meditations” throughout the season, did some various other readings on Stoicism, and signed up for the Daily Stoic group to make sure I had a daily reminder to be thinking about myself and how I am living. I left Idaho a much better man than when I entered it. \n\n	I spent the beginning of this year flying to Hawaii to figure my life out again after being thrown back into my family business job for Christmas season 2018. I had fallen into a depression and lost control of myself. That feeling of being a better man faded rapidly after returning to Pennsylvania and falling right back into my old life. I was miserable and bitter. So, I decided to try something new and try to get my mind back on track. Hawaii was a shorter-lived endeavor than I had planned, but it was significant. The opportunity to stay in paradise and work a job I didn’t care much for came my way. I would have been able to save quite a lot of money quickly and continue enjoying Hawaii for as long as I wanted. After two weeks of contemplation, I decided that I care less about where I am than what I am doing. Staying and taking the job wasn’t for me. I decided to return to Pennsylvania and find more conservation work. Now, I am in Alaska working at the sled dog kennel in Denali National Park. It has been incredible and I have been pushing myself mentally and physically. \n\n	At this point, I have embedded the basic concepts of Stoicism into my life fairly deeply. I journal almost every day (I fail to sometimes, but that’s all a part of the process, huh?), do intermittent fasting to remind myself of my own fragility and to control myself through hunger, undertake days of silence, and try to challenge myself in new ways whenever I can. I’m not sure if I can quite call myself a Stoic yet though. I know that I am ready to take on a mentor and have someone challenge and push me in new ways. Learning more about the foundations of Stoicism is the next step for me. At some point I think I also want to take on a mentor for Taoism and push myself to learn and cultivate more in that direction. The time is not right for that yet. After having such a strong emphasis on creative and emotional expression for most of my life I am ready to push myself logically and in a more structured way. The study of Stoicism, I feel, can certainly assist me in this.\n\n	As far as religion, atheism, deism, theism, etc...I am not entirely sure where I fall. The conventional beliefs regarding an all-powerful God who controls everything don’t feel quite right to me. I thank Mother every day for giving me life and the power to control myself and direct my actions as I will. I believe Mother (nature) is the closest thing there is to God. Nature is just…what exists. To me, that’s godly enough. The fact that things exist is mind-blowing to me. I don’t care to know why or how life exists. All I know is that it does and I seek to use mine as well as I can. I am caught between feeling like there may be some innate order to things and like life consists of sporadic creative bursts, much like how I create music. Some of it is strictly regimented and planned and the rest is just…whatever happens. The fact that I can create makes the idea of Mother having created everything feel a lot less significant. We’re all capable of creation and I think that makes us all our own sort of God. We’re all nature. \n\n', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, '', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', 0, 0, '', ''),

Born in New Hampshire, USA, in 1983, I spent the most significant portion of my childhood up through my years in law school in Massachusetts. I grew up in a closely knit family of Italian descent along with my two younger sisters. \n\nEver since I was a little kid I enjoyed political and philosophical discussion. If you’ve ever sat around a massive dinner table with a family of Italians on holidays you know that inevitably the discussion will get loud and you will end up on politics, amongst other subjects. I would almost always sit at the table and listen to the adults go back and forth, I found it more interesting than going to play with siblings or cousins! \n\nI love hearing both sides and as I got older I would actively participate more in the discussion, often times taking contrarian positions for the sake of good debate and to find the truth of the matter by challenging preconceived notions. These early experiences provided the foundation for my growth into adulthood and the personal, educational, political, social, and business paths that I embarked upon.\n\nI am a graduate of Merrimack College, a Catholic college, with a Bachelor of Arts in Political Science and a double major in Philosophy. I received my Juris Doctor from Suffolk University Law School, where I received an honorable mention award for outstanding performance in oral advocacy. I became licensed by the Florida Bar in 2008, after I moved to Marco Island, Florida in 2007 and completed my studies in law.\n\nI am married to my beautiful and caring wife, Elsa, who is my partner, best friend, and soul mate. Without her, I would not nearly be the man that I am today. Her intelligence, guidance, and understanding are something that I rely on daily. We are tremendously grateful for our three children: Calvin, Tosca, and Lorenzo. \n\nIn September 2015, I was recognized as one of Southwest Florida’s rising business leaders in Gulfshore Business Magazine’s annual 40 Under 40 rising stars feature. The feature recognized my entrepreneurial efforts in acquiring and developing a successful franchise operation throughout south central and southwestern Florida, amongst other small business ventures. \n\nFrom 2013-2016, I created and hosted a political talk FM radio show in Collier County, Florida where I discussed national, state and local news and educated listeners. My show featured many elected officials, popular candidates, and free market experts. Over the course of three years, the show became a top weekend talk show in Collier County and had a dedicated fan base that tuned into his live stream from all over the world.\n\nDuring this period of growth and outreach in my life, I became a somewhat sought-after local speaker in Collier and Lee Counties for events, meetings, political forums, schools, and civic associations. In fact, I was invited in 2014 by the Foundation for Economic Education, the first free-market organization in the United States, to participate as a panelist in a forum discussing important electoral issues impacting the state of Florida.\n\nFrom 2011 through 2016, I was an active civic leader, working with city, county, and state political leaders with a focus on matters impacting our local community. I was a frequent participant at local City Council, County Commission, School Board, and other similar meetings. In 2016, I decided to run for City Council for the City of Marco Island to better serve my community.\n\nWith the support of my family and many throughout our area, I was elected to the Marco Island City Council for a four year term (2016-2020). In my first year on the dais, my fellow Councilors elected me as Council Vice-Chairman for 2016-2017 and during my second year as Chairman from 2017-2018. I currently serve on the Council and I am a co-owner of local small businesses as well as a licensed attorney in the state of Florida. \n\nAll of these past and current experiences have challenged me in many different ways. As a double major in Philosophy during my undergraduate years, I became familiar with Stoicism, though I must admit it was rushed and limited due to the curriculum which tended to focus on Aristotle, Augustine, Socrates, Plato, modern philosophy in various forms, etc. In my mind due to the limited exposure, Stoicism was simply the philosophy of why suicide is OK. That perception stuck with me for years.\n\nDuring my time on City Council, I started to seek a better understanding of life and realized how, as a public figure, you can become wrapped up in the passions and that which is not up to us: the joint decision-making that influences the community and the corresponding highs and lows of public opinion. During some soul searching one day, I happened upon a quote from Marcus Aurelius. It reignited my interest and passion in philosophy, and specifically, Stoicism. I came to learn just how much more Stoicism really was, the foundational principles, and how they all made so much sense to me. I felt a little short-changed that after all these years, after all the hours spent in philosophy classes, that I never really had the opportunity to experience it sooner. \n\nI started devouring Stoic texts, joining Stoic social media groups (Daily Stoic/Traditional Stoicism/Modern Stoicism), participating in Stoic Week, listening to Stoicism on Fire podcasts, and eventually this led me to the College of Stoic Philosophers. \n\nMy list of Stoic texts that I have read is as follows:\n\nA Guide to the Good life, Irvine\nStoicism and the Art of Happiness, Robertson\nHow to Think Like a Roman Emperor, Robertson\nDeterminism and Freedom in Stoic Philosophy, Bobzien\nLectures and Sayings, Musonius Rufus\nThe Philosophy of Chrysippus, Gould\nLetters from a Stoic, Seneca\nThe Inner Citadel, Hadot\nEpictetus: A Stoic and Socratic Guide to Life, AA Long\nDiscourses and Selected Writings, Enchiridion, Epictetus\nMeditations, Aurelius\nPhilosophy as a Way of Life, Hadot (currently reading)\n\nWhile I grew up in a Roman Catholic household and attended a Roman Catholic college, I slowly grew away from the faith. I entered a period of agnosticism but always felt that I needed to continue my search for answers and a better understanding of our existence. Since then, I have slowly begun to emerge back towards the ideas of an ordered cosmos, guided by Universal Reason, a shift emboldened due to my Stoic studies. \n\nI could say that today I consider myself a Stoic, but that wouldn’t be very Stoic of me. I very much understand that I am simply a Stoic-in-training, which so much left to learn and even more to master. I attempt to live in accordance with my nature, the nature of mankind as a whole, and the nature of the Universe. \n\nEverything that happens happens according to Fate, and here I am today. My desire to do more, to be more, continues to increase. I hope that this course can be utilized towards that end.\n\nRegards,\nJared Grifoni\n', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, '', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', 0, 0, '', ''),

How long you have been interested in Stoicism.\n2.	Any books you read on Stoic philosophy. If any, please list them.\n\nDuring the fall of 2017, I read an interview with Ryan Holiday regarding his book, The Obstacle is the Way. This piqued my interest in Stoicism. But knowing The Obstacle is the Way was not specifically a Stoicism primer, I read William Irvine’s, A Guide to the Good Life. I have always been a spiritual and philosophical seeker. For decades, I’ve been a student of religion and some philosophy but was unfamiliar with Stoicism. I was going through a difficult time and a crisis of faith at the time when I stumbled upon Stoicism. Almost immediately, Stoicism provided a meaningful and pragmatic life perspective. While some of the practices were helpful to deal with my difficulties, Stoicism offered a positive and humanistic worldview for living a meaningful life, and thoughtfully engaging life’s struggles. Two Stoic principles that immediately impacted me: 1) Virtue is the highest good, and 2) the dichotomy of control (some things are in our control and others are not). \nI then read Holiday’s book which also provided insights into some of the Stoic principles, but it was certainly more Stoic-lite, at least it was for me. Yet, I am grateful for this work as it did present some of the practical uses of Stoicism. More recently I’ve read Massimo Pigliucci’s, How to be a Stoic, Epictetus’ Enchiridion, and Seneca’s Letters of a Stoic.\n\n3.	Would you call yourself an atheist, agnostic/skeptic, deist, theist?\n4.	Are you a member of a religious faith? If so, which and for how long?\n\nI am a 53 years old Puerto-Rican man born and raised in New York City. Most of my life, I’ve lived in New York, resided in San Diego for one year, and have lived in Lima, OH since October 2017. I was a Christian for 50 years, and have journeyed throughout Christendom, both as a follower and student. I was raised Roman Catholic, traveled through Evangelicalism, Eastern Orthodoxy, and liberal Christianity. I hold an MA in Theological Studies with a Justice and Peace concentration from Maryknoll School of Theology, and a Ph.D. in Religious Education from Fordham University. I also served as a pastor for three years with the Reformed Church in America. \nI’ve always been an intellectual, a question-asker, a seeker, and a social justice advocate, so I consider myself open-minded and fascinated by the social-cultural-historical-philosophical aspects of religion and religious traditions. When I started to study philosophy more in depth, later in life, I increasingly became agnostic and ultimately atheistic. It’s been a challenge for me as it upended my religious self-identify. I am more atheistic, but cannot deny I find myself open to mystery and, on the occasion, the possibility of some cosmic deism. \n\nOn an intellectual level, I’ve been fascinated with some of the dialogue/debates between traditional Stoicism (which invokes a God or providential viewpoint) and contemporary Stoicism (which is secular). I appreciate Chris Fisher’s more theistic/deistic teachings on his podcast, Stoicism on Fire. It speaks to my religious constitution. In particular, I cannot deny his phrase that Stoicism is a “rational form of spirituality,” resonates with me. On the other hand, Massimo Pigliucci’s more secular teachings remove much of the toxicity that comes from psychological religious strongholds. Nevertheless, I don’t overly dwell on that for I consider myself ethically and religiously humanistic. Yet, after five decades of attending church, I organically seek out Sunday morning community. Currently, I attend a Unitarian Universalist Fellowship with a liberal and broad-minded group. I affirm the principle and experience of community. Sometimes, when conversations begin to invoke God or spirituality, I intrinsically react atheistically. Not in any apologetic sense, but simply trying to understand and engage life in a humanistic and non-super natural way. And, while I find traditional divine revelation or religious dogma anathema, even repugnant at times, the possibility of providence or deism or natural theology is still one that bubbles in my heart. I do not ponder matters beyond death. Nevertheless, whether providential or serendipitous, I find Stoicism an attractive philosophy which engages my intellect and heart. It is one which I desire to know more in depth.\n\n5.	Have you studied philosophies other than Stoicism? If so, which?\n\nI’ve had a general overview of various philosophies. Existentialism and pragmatism are the perspectives with which I most resonate. While I’ve also studied secular Buddhism and cognitive behavioral therapy, Stoicism has been the most helpful and meaningful.\n\n6.	Do you consider yourself to be a Stoic?\n\nWhile I’ve read and continue to read Stoic writings, both contemporary and classic, I do not have enough of a formal foundation of knowledge to consider myself a Stoic. It would seem premature and presumptuous of me to self-identify as a Stoic with no proper training, which is why I am so grateful for The College of Stoic Philosophers. \nHowever, I have enough of an interest to begin a more formal novitiate training, hence my application to the School of Essential Studies. I also find myself listening to Stoic podcasts (The Practical Stoic Podcast, The Sunday Stoic, Stoic Meditations, Stoicism on Fire), reading Stoic books and websites, and increasingly making references to Stoicism. I am particularly excited with the mentorship piece of this program as I welcome the opportunity to learn from a more mature and advanced Stoic Sage. I believe this is an essential piece to Stoic learning and seems consistent with the mentor/student tradition in Stoicism.\n\n7.	What you want to get from this course.\n\nFirst, I want to learn the basic teachings of Stoicism. Second, I want to discuss and more deeply understand classic Stoic works. I also want to develop a collection of Stoic resources, particularly commentaries on Stoic writings. I welcome recommendations. I also want to learn how to live like a Stoic. I am very interested in standard Stoic disciplines.\n\nFinally, I live in northwest Ohio (Lima), where there are no Stoic groups nearby. Eventually, I would like to start a Stoic community where students of Stoicism can fellowship with each other and deepen their knowledge of Stoicism. With more in-depth training, I would feel more comfortable facilitating a space for Stoic fellowship and learning.', 1, '2020-01-01', 0, 0, 0, '', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 'Fred did not complete Logic.

In a manner parallel to their marriage, eventual divorce and Diana’s untimely death, I have spent my life with a deteriorating view of myself and the world around me.\n\nI was a happy boy, I had some great friends at school, and dreamed of being a train driver or a pilot or a detective. I used to make stories up as we’d play in the playground, making police badges, checking everyone was safe, and occasionally getting in trouble for dirtying our trousers.\n\nThen, when I was 7, I was taken to look around schools, and a tutor started coming to the house on a Saturday morning. I took two entrance exams, and I had no idea what it all meant. Then, one dreary autumn day in 1989, my parents took me out of our local primary school to start taking a thirty minute bus journey to a private school.\n\nThe result was that I lost all those friends and severed the security and connection I had with my hometown. What new friendships I made, were people who lived much further away, in bigger houses, and from backgrounds very different to mine. It was clear to me that this was ‘an opportunity which I mustn’t waste and had to be grateful for’.\n\nIt wasn’t a conscious response, but I became the class clown, forming fleeting friendships with various social groups throughout school. I never stood still, always moving. I did what needed to be done in the classroom, I listened well, because I was always looking for my next quip. I joined a band, played sports, got drunk, smoked cigarettes, did everything and anything.\n\nWhen exams came around, I didn’t study, I remembered enough from my alertness in the lessons to do quite well. In choosing a career, I was so unsure of what my life’s purpose was that I just went along with the teacher’s advice: Business, Mathematics or Engineering. Looking back, I didn’t enjoy those subjects, I just happened to be okay at everything and these were more financially viable options. In 2000, I went to University to study Electronic Engineering, then I changed to Computer Science and finally, Economics before dropping out altogether.\n\nI was in and out of relationships, in and out of jobs, drinking and smoking a lot more, unable to commit to life, to anything. I moved on from my friendships, one after the other, leaving them behind as I did when I was a child. I moved around a lot, until I met my now wife, in 2006.\n\nI started to feel more of a sense of purpose, but there was a lot still missing. I did a couple of creative writing courses at night school and used my portfolio to undertake a masters degree in writing (without having the undergraduate degree) with a dream of writing a novel. I finished and passed the masters, but through paralysis by analysis, it knocked my confidence in writing. My distrust in the academic system had hit a high, and by now I was so used to not amounting to anything, that I was anxious, stuck, and was referred to therapy to help me to cope. I was always waiting for something else around the corner, some other life, career, better, more interesting.\n\nJen and I were married on a cold winter’s day in early 2009 and had the first of our four children. It should have been a time of intense happiness and joy, and it was, but it was darkened by my parents bitter disappointment in me: my lack of career; lack of education; bringing a child into the world without these things in place.\n\nMy impression of them and relationship with them has never really recovered. Shortly after, my mother was diagnosed with a brain tumour. She’s undergone surgery, radiotherapy and is currently on chemotherapy. Her battle with the illness is incredible, and in a large part I’ve had to box up the past and shelf my emotions, but it doesn’t feel as though I have truly let go.\n\nAt the time of my son’s birth, I just happened to be working for a power company, in a call centre. I made the decision to learn as much as I could about the industry. Perhaps I foresaw the notion of Amor Fati: that the career had chosen me. In any case something compelled me to do everything I could to be the best I could be. Ten years on, I work as an Energy Consultant and have the career I was always ‘supposed’ to have. But it hasn’t made me happier or feel more fulfilled and I don\'t really know why.\n\nIn all of this time, I’ve battled with additions, depression, anxiety. And so four to five years ago I began turning to philosophy via the School of Life to try to make sense of the world. I was interested in Nietzsche, Camus and considered myself an Absurdist for a while. I’ve also forayed into spiritual philosophies relating to Buddhism and Hinduism, though in their nature I don’t truly believe in the spiritual aspects of those teachings. Though I was raised as a Christian, I am an atheist, and believe in proven logic over spiritual faith.\n\nIn early 2017 my wife was diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis. It wasn’t the end of our worlds, but it was the start of a new chapter for us. I\'d also struggled with my health, suffering from acid re-flux, heart palpitations, vocal damage. It was time to make some crucial lifestyle changes to cope better and live better with the stresses of life and the ease with which we can all fall into bad habits or poor eating. It was the spring of that year that I knew some positive steps needed to be taken for a better life for us and our children.\n\nIn this last couple of years, I’ve developed more of an affinity with Stoicism. I haven’t read too widely on the subject, beyond some articles and videos, so I don’t know a great deal about it in any depth, but I saw learning it as something that was more than just a means to an end, rather a process that I found interesting in and of itself. Something I could get behind, continually discover, and that would impact my outlook on an otherwise meaningless existence.\n\nI consider myself to be a candidate for Stoicism, based on some of this high-level research I’ve done on the subject. I seek to be more grateful for what I have, to connect with the world around me, and understand my place in it. I wish to build stronger relationships with people while not worrying about what others think and staying rational in the face of adversity. I have a logical mind, I just don’t always use it.\n\nUnlike Nihilism or Absurdism, I feel it is a philosophy I can endorse wholeheartedly and pass on to my children to prepare them for the world, to avoid the pitfalls I’ve had myself over the years. Perhaps this element of fatherhood is my true life’s purpose.\n', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, '', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', 0, 0, '', ''),

Today, I live in Germany where I enjoy a half-time position as a music teacher. It was in May (2019), that I seriously decided to live a stoic life. I read Marcus\'s Meditations and Seneca\'s essay On the Shortness of Life. Currently, I\'m reading Stoicism by J. Sellars and listening to Stoicism on Fire by Chris Fisher. Mr. Fisher\'s explanations were perfect for me as a beginner. The more I dive into this material, the more convinced I am that this is how I want to live. What follows is my "Know Thyself" essay.  \n\nI come from a conservative family of Catholics who never encouraged us to think outside the box. My father was a strategist who always got the best deals. He knew how to move the right figures to have everything work for him. He was successful in that way. Everyone looked up to him and as a boy, I felt lucky to have him as my dad. He was the loudest at parties, the smartest in business, and a saint in the eyes of my aunts and grandparents. Above all, he was brave. Once a year he would go hunting to a deserted island bringing back stories that would echo all year round. He built a great image for himself, one that had everything to do with honor. My sister shattered that image when she decided to leave the Catholic church. A man used to power found himself powerless. My father, not able to control the situation, broke our family. He mistreated my mother (who supported my sister) for years. This affected everyone in the family. He stopped being my hero. And to this day I carry that past on my back. Even though I\'ve tried many times to forgive, I couldn\'t. Perhaps one day I will...\n\nRight when my sister became an Adventist, I had moved to the capital to study music. Free like a butterfly, I pursued the path of pleasure: sex, food, and career success. I got a superb orchestra job that supported all my vices. Breaking the commandments of my Church was fun, but I was not ready to part ways with Jesus. I would confess my sins to the priest but kept committing them again and again. This helped me enjoy my pleasures while feeling "closer" to God. \n\nIn the summer of 2009, I discovered a new pleasure: traveling. I won a spot in 2 different symphony orchestras to travel the world. Since then traveling has become an obsession. What an incredible feeling to leave everything behind and enjoy novelty. What an incredible feeling to escape. I soon became a travel hacker, learning to collect points and miles for free flights and hotel stays. The entire world was within reach for free or very cheap. But like every drug, it left me unsatisfied. It left me wanting an even cooler, more impressive trip. I never fully appreciated the gift to see the world. My head was always ahead planning the next adventure. From 2009 to 2012 I traveled extensively. I moved New Mexico to pursue a master\'s in violin performance. During my studies, I met my wife who would often join me in my travels. I still went on solo trips. There was something about being alone that I enjoyed. Especially when life hit hard and I needed an escape.\n\nRight after graduation, my wife (then girlfriend) and I moved to her native Germany. Leaving Puerto Rico and the United States was the most difficult thing I have done. Finding a job, learning the language, and adjusting to the culture were no easy tasks. Luckily, I knew how to escape. I traveled. I flew away the moment I got a chance. I was traveling 4-6 times a year, and in 2016, with my wife 6 months pregnant, I escaped. Knowing that I still had 2-3 more months before that new stage of life began, I ran away one last time. I prepared a 2-week tour to visit 4 different countries in Scandinavia. But after 6 days, my wife called that something was not right. The ambulance had taken her to the hospital where she eagerly waited for me. Feeling like the worst father in the world, I flew back home. My wife was losing amniotic water due to a small rupture inside. She had to lay down for the rest of her pregnancy to keep the fluids and save our child. We lived in the hospital for a month. Thankfully, everything turned all right, the baby was still an early-born but he is today a healthy boy.  \n\nSince my son\'s birth, my travels diminished. But my wish hasn\'t. I still feel the need to escape. This feeling sent me looking for answers. I\'ve tried zooming out and looking at my life as part of a tiny pale blue dot of a planet. From that far I can almost see how I belong to the world as part of its components. How I\'m not the center of it all. Since I started reading about stoicism, I\'m thinking about my death often. It helps me appreciate my young family. Thinking about providence and my God also helps give my life purpose. I want to become a more understanding and patient teacher, father, and husband. Although I stopped attending church when I moved to Germany, I still pray. I am still a Christian and relate providence with my own Christian beliefs. Applying to the SES course was the next step in the direction of improving my character. I look forward to playing my role as nature intended, as part of the whole. \n\nMoreover, I want to learn the Stoic views on forgiveness. I\'m looking forward to my mentor\'s thoughts.  A difficult journey awaits, and I am aware of it. I\'m also aware that it will be worth the effort to build my moral character. Because I don\'t want to escape anymore. I want to finally face the events of life with courage, agreement (with nature) and wisdom.

My father was a general practice physician, whose office was in our house.  In those days, family doctors did everything – deliver babies, stitch up cuts, and provide palliative care and bereavement support to families.  My dad was ‘on call’ all the time, and I observed how he retained his calm, rational demeanor no matter what situation he faced. He would frequently quote from Hippocrates (“Physician, heal thyself”), and emphasized that the job of the physician was the same in modern times, as it was in ancient. He would also talk frequently about control of emotions in order to make the best possible medical decision. Both my mother and father were deeply committed to rationalism and education. I cannot recall superstition ever being taken seriously in our home.  I think it is fair to describe my parents and close family members as ‘lower case’ stoics – particularly my sister and father.  Although the term ‘stoic’ was never discussed in a philosophic sense, many of the attitudes and approaches I observed, even maxims I heard growing up, seem Stoic in retrospect.  Perhaps my family were ‘intuitive Stoics’.\r\nLike many non-religious Jewish kids at that time, I was sent to Hebrew school. I rebelled from the outset, particularly since our family was neither religious nor Zionist. I believed that it was hypocritical that my parents would send me there, when we did not observe the rituals, and prayer was not part of our family life. My parent’s reasons for sending me were largely cultural and social – that is what they and their peers did with their kids in those days. But my rebellion led me to read both the Old and New Testaments. And, I concluded as a teenager that, while these books had some interesting historical elements and occasional sections of great beauty (such as Ecclesiastes – a lifelong favorite of mine), I became a committed atheist. It was only as I matured into manhood that I realized that a definitive statement about the existence of God was both hubristic and anti-rational – how could I, as a tiny speck in the vast universe – know with certainty that a deity did not exist?  So, for most of my adult life, therefore, I lived as an agnostic with antipathy toward organized religion. \r\nIn seventh and eight grade, my school required that we study Latin, as well as a course in Ancient & Medieval history. Along the way, I had superficial exposure to Marcus Aurelius – and I vaguely recall reading excerpts – but my exposure was limited, at best. It is only in the past couple of years –particularly as a result of my exposure to the work of Chris Fisher – that I have come to a more pantheistic view. I can no longer call myself an agnostic. \r\nSo how did I come to this point?  I am now 60 years old, I have been married for 23 years to a hot blooded “Xanthippe” who generously tests me on a daily basis. I have two children, ages 20 and 22. For about four years now, I have been very consciously been on the Path of the Prokopton. But, I came to Stoicism somewhat by accident: I was asked to teach a graduate level leadership course, and I picked up the Meditations. As I read, I had an epiphany – and that was that Stoic philosophy provides extraordinary tools for leaders. And since that time, I have incorporated it, first experimentally, into my teaching – more on that below. \r\nOver the past few years, I have read the Stoic literature extensively, but I lack mastery. I backslide constantly, and try to do better next time. I am progressing, but I need mentorship.  As to the specifics of my reading, among the classics, I have read Marcus, Epictetus, Seneca, and Musonius Rufus - in some cases multiple times. Of the moderns, I have read Hadot, Long, Sellars, Inwood, Irvine, Robertson, etc. My readings have also taken me (at the suggestion of Ward Farnsworth) to explore Montaigne, Schopenhauer and even Nietzsche.  I have also read some of the more ‘pop’ authors – Holiday, Pigliucci, etc. – but the more I have read, the more I have been drawn back to the Ancients.  As to whether I have ‘followed’ other philosophies, the answer would be no. Of the ancients, I have read both Aristotle and Plato and, from a personal perspective, find Aristotle to elitist and Plato too idealist for my taste.\r\nI have been a serial entrepreneur most of my life. Somewhere along the way I managed to earn a PhD, but I never had a full-time faculty position until five years ago, when I became a university professor. Because I arrived at that position immediately following having held nationally prominent position in my field, I was asked to take over the prerequisite organizational leadership course that all entering master’s degree students are required to take, and which many doctoral students take, as well.  Students range in age from recent college graduates to forty somethings, preparing for career transitions.  Many are hoping to become leaders of colleges or school superintendents, principals or assistant principals. Some have worked in very challenging environments already.\r\nWhen I took it over, the course was conventional in orientation, focusing on an overview of the myriad of modern leadership ‘theories’. I found the texts wanting. Most of these so-called ‘theories’ are really approaches, lenses or frameworks – often with heuristic value, but likewise difficult to utilize in real life.  Because I believe that it is impossible to lead others unless one can ‘lead oneself’, I began integrating Stoic philosophy into the weekly assigned readings. This is where my experimentation with Stoicism really began in earnest.\r\nFor the past three years, my students (approximately 85, so far) have read the Meditations, the Enchiridion, and selections from the Discourses, Musonius Rufus, and Seneca’s Moral Epistles over the course of a semester (remember, this is not a philosophy course). My class has both face-to-face meetings and online discussion boards. Students are required to reflect “meditate” on the Stoic readings each week, linking them back to their own lives or leadership principles that we are reading about in the conventional texts.  For the final exam, I have the students each create a “Enchiridion for Leadership – To Myself” – which is intended to be at hand for use as they lead through their life and careers.  Many of the students find their exposure to Stoicism hugely value and, of course, this comes as no surprise. \r\nNaturally, I am reading my students reflections on Stoic matter, and I am interacting with them and it, as well, on a daily basis – so, this pedagogical experiment has become part of my own daily practice.  That said, I believe that the experience of working with a mentor through a school such as the College of Stoic Philosophers will greatly help my own Stoic spiritual exercise.  ', 1, '2019-02-02', 1, 0, 0, '', 0, '', 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 'Mitch Leventhal is a serial enterpreneur and educational leader who began studying Stoicism intensively about six years ago.

Since then I have read fairly widely on Stoicism. Below is a list of all the books I can recall reading about or related to Stoicism:\n\nPrimary Sources & Commentaries\nSeneca. Letters. Several editions, though the new(ish) University of Chicago edition is my favorite.\nMusonius Rufus. Lectures and Sayings (Cynthia King translator)\nEpictetus. Discourses, Handbook, Fragments. Multiple translations (Robin Hard’s Everyman translation most often). I’ve probably read this a dozen or more times over the years.\nMarcus Aurelius. Meditations. I’ve read multiple editions multiple times, and lectured on the text for a class I taught several times.\nCicero. On Moral Ends, Tusculum Disputations, On Obligations, as well as various essay collections.\n\nModern Sources\nBecker. A New Stoicism\nBrennan. The Stoic Life: Emotions, Duties, and Fate\nCooper. Pursuits of Wisdom\nFarnsworth. The Practicing Stoic: A Philosophical User\'s Manual\nHadot. The Inner Citadel, What is Ancient Philosophy?, Philosophy as a Way of Life\nIrvine. A Guide to the Good Life\nLong. Epictetus: A Stoic and Socratic Guide to Life.\nNussbaum. The Therapy of Desire. (Which I thought was great, except for what I see as her significant misreading of the role of emotions in Stoicism. It was sort of stunning to me that someone as obviously bright as Martha Nussbaum could so misread the Stoics on that important point.)\nPigliucci. How to be a Stoic.\nRobertson. Teach Yourself Stoicism\nSellars. Stoicism (Ancient Philosophies)\nStockdale. Thoughts of a Philosophical Fighter Pilot\nUssher. Stoicism Today: Selected Writings\n\nIn addition, I’ve read a number of anthologies of Western philosophy which feature extended discussion of Stoicism, as well as biographies of Marcus Aurelius and Seneca. \n\nI was also one of the moderators of a Facebook stoicism group. (https://www.facebook.com/groups/2204659768/) I resigned that role a few years ago as I felt that a Facebook group wasn’t such a great forum for discussing Stoic philosophy and it seemed that my time might be more usefully spent elsewhere.\n\nWhile I take issue with certain points of what might be called Stoic doctrine, I feel that the Stoic worldview is almost entirely my own. The main divergence is my view that God or Logos is both immanent and transcendent, as opposed to the strictly materialist view of almost all Stoics I’m aware of. In this, I feel more convinced by the arguments concerning the fundamental nature of God put forth by Aquinas in the Summa Theologica, thought Aquinas and I part ways shortly after that.)\n\nBefore I was a Stoic I was a Buddhist and I’ve studied Buddhist literature quite a lot. I still meditate almost daily, though I now think of my meditation mainly as helping improve my meta-cognition so that I can more readily realize when an impression may be overtaking me. I was raised a Catholic, and I’m very familiar with that religious tradition, but I fell away from the Church in my early adulthood as it didn’t provide what I felt to be plausible answers to the Big Questions of life. \n\nMy hope is that given my background you might consider me for the Marcus Aurelius program. In my department at Northern Kentucky University, we regularly waive upper-level course requirements when a student seems to have the aptitude for the work despite not having the prerequisite class or classes. I don’t know if that’s something you feel is appropriate in this case, but I ask that you consider it, if possible.\n\nI hope to get a number of things out of this experience. The first is an opportunity to have my understanding of Stoic philosophy and practice (though I tend to see them as an integrated whole) tested and improved upon by those who are in a position to improve my understanding. The second – and far more important – goal for me is a highly practical one. My oh-so humble goal is to be a Stoic Sage, and while I realize how incredibly ambitious that is, I can think of nothing else more important to aim for in this life. Increasing my wisdom through this experience will, I believe, help me move closer to that goal. Finally, I would like to one day form a Stoic group in my community. To that end, I feel I should grow as much as possible in wisdom. \n\nThank you for considering my application.\n\nI’m including this final bit because when I initially submitted my essay, it was rejected for being less than 1,000 words. I reviewed the questions you ask applicants to address and it seems to me that I’ve fully answered them. I can always tell when a student pads a paper I’ve assigned to get to my minimum word count, so I won’t do that. Instead, I’ll just add some not so randomly chosen words below to reach the minimum. If you need any more detail from me concerning anything I’m happy to provide it.\n\nOf all the faculties, you will find not one which is capable of contemplating itself; and, consequently, not capable either of approving or disapproving. How far does the grammatic art possess the contemplating power? As far as forming a judgement about what is written and spoken. And how far music? As far as judging about melody. Does either of them then contemplate itself? By no means. But when you must write something to your friend, grammar will tell you what words you must write; but whether you should write or not, grammar will not tell you. And so it is with music as to musical sounds; but whether you should sing at the present time and play on the lute, or do neither, music will not tell you. What faculty then will tell you? That which contemplates both itself and all other things. And what is this faculty? The rational faculty; for this is the only faculty that we have received which examines itself, what it is, and what power it has, and what is the value of this gift, and examines all other faculties: for what else is there which tells us that golden things are beautiful, for they do not say so themselves? Evidently it is the faculty which is capable of judging of appearances. What else judges of music, grammar, and other faculties, proves their uses and points out the occasions for using them? Nothing else.\n\n\n', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, '', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', 0, 0, '', ''),

According to my father\'s belief my existence would be significant, though I think many parents, especially religious ones think that way about their children. A belief like that and the attitude it carries towards the offspring can either elevate or curse them, in my case it was more of the latter than the former which influenced my childhood and shaped my mind in many ways.\n\nBeing raised in a zealous Pentecostal family of a man searching for perfection within the Christian world never to find it, I was exposed to harsh moral regime and psychological pressure since I remember. Somehow, unlike in many cases of zealous upbringing, it did not extinguish the desire for God in my life as I was always ready to defend Christian faith and any form of belief from mockery. At some point I become very fond of solitude, as I felt it to be a great moment of reckoning, peace of mind and thinking about my future self. This made me a poor party company, since I always used to start an existential or philosophical conversations, sometimes with a surprising level of interest from some of the revelers.\n\nI am grateful to my father for his harsh discipline and punishments, though I know many times they were taken too far or were too hasty, yet it is him who taught me that a man never runs away from his problems just because they are difficult. It is him who taught me never to mock people because of their job or material situation. It is him who used to leave me in the night outside of my parents bedroom so I would finally face my fear and learn to sleep alone. It is him who forced me to mow the grass in the summer and bring the wood for the fireplace in the winter, to be useful at least in that basic sense. Yet the price for this upbringing is a scattered relationship and a complete lack of bond. I do not blame him, he did what he though was the best for his son to became a man, and I would probably put my own son to the similar trials, though I was able to observe which of them were harmful and which beneficial.\n\nAs I have turned twenty years of age I was influenced by a more free thinking member of my family and begun to explore more traditional forms of Christianity, going through traditional Protestantism to my father\'s great disapproval and even worse - ending in the Eastern Orthodox church, at the age of twenty three. These decisions only distanced me further away from my parents who by that time saw only themselves and very few others to be the only true Christians.\n\nAs the tensions in my house kept on rising and I felt emotional pressure destroying me slowly, I deemed it best to move out and stayed with my best friend and his mother for almost a year. This was the time when I was able to observe how people\'s vices can destroy their lives in a literal way. Because of their conscious sinful way of life not only they have lost their mental sanity but also their social and financial well being and eventually one of them died. Again, I was saved by some strange providence just before the worst started, at that time I though it to be a bad situation as I had to move our somewhere far away in a rush, but I was able to accept these hardships with an attitude of a donkey pulling his wagon. \n\nWhen an opportunity arose, I managed to cut the chains and escape to another country in which I had to start a brand new life and social existence as well as work for my survival for the first time in my life. While attending to my local orthodox parish I was struggling with my emotions, being constantly anxious about the future or lacking confidence in myself. At some point I had a prospect of losing the roof over my head while being unable to find a new place to live in a short time that was given to me. It was then when my stress and anxiety gave me a lesson worth remembering, out of pure stress I would fall asleep completely exhausted during the day. Different visions of my ambitions ruined, of being homeless or worse - returning to my parents were swirling in my head. Nevertheless I have found another place to live just a day before I had to move out. \n\nIt was shortly afterwards when my desire for classical education and civilized life led me to "Meditations" of Marcus Aurelius, after which I was left with the feeling of widened horizon, and elevation of my thoughts and desires. Just like Plato explains in his \'Phaedrus\', my soul contacted something beautiful and higher, and desired to raise to the new levels of my humanity. It was something completely different from the Christian writings I knew by that time and yet it had a common goal and perspective.\n\nBut "Meditations" were just the beginning, and something of much greater influence was meant to be read by me - "Moral letters to Lucilius" by Seneca. If there is anything which changed my life in an immeasurable way, it is these letters. I have become an ardent \'follower\' of Seneca, reading his letters every day until I read them all only to start reading them again to understand it better. At first I thought that Stoicism will never stand in the way of my Christian life, but I was wrong. The more I have read about the history of religion the more I noticed how it absorbs its predecessors to recreate the past in a new version. The more Stoic literature I was reading the more I realized how much it influenced my religion and that Christian vision of the human nature and the universe is nothing new really. At some point, I also had a very mystical dream after which I woke up as if I have not been breathing for a long time with lots of emotional reactions, but when I tried to talk about it with my priest, he said that the church fathers says dreams are too fickle and we should not pay attention to them. I know that a priest of a different orthodox tradition would probably gladly listen about it but I also knew in spite of my curiosity about my dream that perhaps it is best to leave it. \n\nAt some point when I was praying I not only noticed lack of any influence of prayer on my life but I also begun to think why do I say \'let your will be done\' and right after that petition God to prevent this or grant that. I still believe in the divine but this kind of prayer seems to be contradictory to me, especially after I have read Stoic advises on how to pray. Then I reached the point when personified god was no longer enough for me, I thought it to be rather narrow and limited way of describing God. It is meaningful and wise I cannot deny that but I cannot help seeing it dyed with human hopes and fears. Thus I have turned towards worshiping a philosophical God - Logos. Is that decision correct, I do not know but what I know is that life devoted to truth and God is not a wasted life, and will be rewarding in itself and maybe even in its end itself. After all, only a servant who buried the talents was expelled from lord\'s household, the rest was rewarded, regardless of profit they have made.\n\nIt has been two years since I have discovered Stoicism. The only Stoic writer I still have to cover in a larger extend is Epictetus. I am also reading "God and Cosmos in Stoicism" by R. Salles, though I find its language too academic and difficult to process. I still have not sided completely with either pantheism or panentheism, but I suppose my discoveries about religion lead me towards pantheism.\n\nApart from reading some Plato and Cicero(who advocates for Stoicism anyway), I have not studied any other philosophies, I do consider myself a Stoic and I have my little Stoic discussion group in the city, which I run with a limited success. What I am interested in is the truth, I hope this course will help me to gain better knowledge about Stoicism, life, death, myself, God and cosmos. To make one step more towards my divine nature from which so many things distract and separate me. Maybe it will help me to understand religion from a different level and return to it, or maybe, as one of my friends have said, it will help me to understand religion from a different level and because of that – not return to it.', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, '', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', 0, 0, '', ''),

My life journey has been yet most ordinary but through all things, I am grateful for all the chances that have been given to me of which I have grown. Since my graduation, I worked outside for 6 years before coming back home to help with the family business.\n\nI was born in Bangkok, Thailand on the 22nd April 1989 as the first son, first grandson to a Chinese family. My family consists of Mom, Dad, me and my little brother; with my dad’s siblings and grandparents being part of the extended family.  Mom and Dad both maintain a full time job, where we normally spend weekends together. To fill in the gaps after school, my mom hired a tutor; a part time university students to teach us (me and my brother) Thais, English, mathematics and read with us. Being born into the family as the first born and first grandsons, there seems to be external expectations towards me since young. I remembered my parents will always explain that clever people are ones with rationales and reason. Being rebellious to the pressure and expectations, as a kid used to hate reading, questions why we need to study? And ponder why do we have to born? Being but a young kid (6 years old), I would discuss this and boast to my tutor with my childish logic and understanding “Buddha says we are born into this world to understand suffering, and Jesus says we are born into this world to understand how to love ourselves and others.” - (Thinking back “What a vain kid!”).\n\nThis pride and vanity in my primary and secondary school years leads me to my (superficial) studies of philosophy. I would tackle harder books than what those my age read like Nietzsche’s Beyond Good and Evil while I was in grade 7, read Sun Tzu the Art of War or Dante’s Inferno(in grade 9) or being full of pride reciting Nietzshe’s “What does not kill me makes me stronger”. Books are something that my family never shines away from getting me or stopped me from getting them. Although I didn’t put on the airs or boast to others of being learned, I know that feeling of knowing more gave me sweet satisfactions (no matter whether that knowledge is true. Growing up in my school years are typically for this modern ages, being slightly to the part of the cool kids. I was part of the school swimming and basketball team; became the House Captain and the Head Boy (British equivalent of the Student President). Being blessed to be given a privileged education, I received many chances to grow myself within regards to activities and academics while enjoying the vices that plague teenagers (Seeking validations, alcohols and little hanging out here and there).\n\nThe question of why we are born into this world? Or the answer to existence has always remained at the back of my mind and I always feel that this is my calling, having good grades in Physics; I was motivated towards Physics and Philosophy degree but was later persuaded by my parents to take on an Mechanical Engineering. Up until this point, I was growing up in Bangkok, Thailand and starting my university degree was my first time living aboard. Being a little “homesick”, I was driven to find refuge in studying Eastern philosophies under the culture that I have grown up in namely “Buddhism” followed suit by Zen and Daoism. I would enjoyed to pass my time reading a Zen paradox in the koans or reflecting Lao Tzu’s Dao De Jing, Zhuangzi’s humors or Confucius and Menicius’ Loving Kindness. The writings and circumstances in my life have introduced me to the transient nature of life and how each person’s circumstances shaped their thoughts, speeches and actions.\n\nComing back home the first time from abroad, I was asked by my mom to accompany her to a Buddhist Retreat which co-aligned with my interest in Buddhism. Before one undertake upon one’s self the eight precepts, one has to typically confess one’s faults and ask for forgiveness of which my teacher (a Buddhist nun whom I would later revered nearly as my own mother).\n\nRough translations of the ritual into English below;\n\n[First paying respects to the Buddha and bowing our heads down to pay respects to the universe]\n“In the past that has been due, I have lived together and closed with my mother and father. Whatever actions that I have done, to saddens you (mother or father); no matter in public or in private, no matter with intent or without intents, whether through body, speech or mind; I have done them through heedlessness, not-knowing through my own ignorance. May you forgive these faults, for the, observance, cultivation and my growth for times to come.”\n\nWhile I was saying those words, my mind brought forth all those small things in the past that I caused my mom to be unhappy, to worry or to cry.\n\nBowing down to my mother’s feet, I cried and cried. My mom putting one of her hands on my head, stroked it lightly. Tears also in her eyes, whispered “I forgive you, my child. May there be growth and blessing to you.”\nThat was first of what I deem is a spiritual experiences that steered me towards studying of self as opposed to the externals. It steered me to find refuge in what is spiritual learning as opposed to my “book” knowledge. This happened 12 years ago during April of 2007. I hoped I can claim myself as a practicing Buddhist up until today.\n\nThere are conflicts and hardships that our family has amicably solved through “knowing and understanding ourselves and circumstances” and small gradual changes of habits and understanding. Over the 12 years, Buddhist practices have become how I reflected and helped me through many personal struggles. (These struggles or other experiences and conflicts may be shared as a story for another day.)\n\nMy journey has brought me to the Buddhist scriptures and studies of Buddhist Psychology. Buddhism being in the form that is known to us today is passed down through the development of monastics culture and transformation in Myanmar and Thailand. Growing up in the culture, there are many things that are passed on by traditions and practices that we no longer remembered “why we do, what we do.” It is also difficult to separate what is a latter development opposed to what is taught by the Buddha. In the beginning of this year, I found some Stoic literature of which I am hoping to get a different vantage point towards ancient spiritual practice as opposed to how Buddhism is taught today. There is something that attracts me towards Stoicism; there are practical reasons, rationality as well as the acceptances towards the truth that I found familiar in the teachings of the Ancient Stoicism, of what is foremost I hope to get some glimpses into how the ancients study, practice and live these teachings. There’s also the yearning to learn more on what the ancients felt is a life worth living.\nEastern Thoughts have a different view towards the question of the divine. Being a Buddhist, my beliefs are framed within regards to Cause and Effect. In Buddhist Cosmology, there are beings that are more sublime than humans. Being Thais, our culture is also influenced by the Hindus and being a Chinese descents; we worship our ancestors. I believed there is a natural order to the universe, this order is conscious, self-organizing and being the causes and bringing the consequences; but this order cannot be classified into a being or a person. The nature of this order is transient and ever-changing.\n\nRegarding to books I recently read on Stoicism:\n•	Robin Hard’s Translation of the Enchiridion\n•	Shallow reading of Meditations\n•	Recently started John Sellars’ Stoicism\n•	Getting into Pierre Hadot’s work of Philosophy as a Way of Life and Inner Citadel.\n\nNevertheless, I do feel that this journey will be a rewarding one, if the studies of Stoicism will help me towards more self-reflections and understanding. \nI have yet to identify as a stoic \nbut as a fellow seeker of truth.\n\nThank you.\n\nTrin Phongpetra\n', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, '', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', 0, 0, '', ''),

I am from India and at present residing in Bangalore (Southern part of India).  Born into a family of teachers and engineers, I completed my school in a convent and Bachelors’ (in Mechanical Engineering) from Bangalore University.  With no siblings of my own, I grew up in a joint family along with my cousins.  I am 45 years old, but a very young “Seeker”.\nI joined a reputed retail group in India after my Bachelors’ and worked in retail sector for 16 years before making a shift to Information Technology Company in the year 2013.  Since then, I have travelled (especially European continent) quite a bit as my role involves interaction with clients.  \nI am married and have two children.  My son is aged 15.5 yrs. and daughter 13.  Having two teens at home keeps me and my wife super busy as we have to balance our lives and manage their ever-growing needs.  My better- half is passionate about Yoga.  She has completed her Advanced Yoga Teachers Training and now helps young pupils in their Yoga pursuits.\nIn India the competition is very high (due to a huge population) and I used to work for almost 12-13 hours per day (for 6 days) when I was in highly dynamic and ever-changing Retail industry.  I hardly had time for family (& myself) and was constantly under great stress.   In September 2012, I lost my job.  As I was not prepared for such an eventuality, it hit me real hard.  I was shocked and in-denial thinking that such things do not happen to me and only others.  I was blaming my boss, the organization etc. for the mishap (I later realized that I had to take responsibility for whatever happened).   It was a major turning point in my life.  Before my next job, I was at home for 3 months.  After the initial shock, the reality sunk in and I decided to give a bit of thought to the way I was managing my life.  At this point, I got an introduced to the teachings of an ancient Indian Sage by name Adi Shankaracharya.  He propounded Advaita (non-dual) philosophy and it opened up a whole new world.\nThe new concepts, had me excited and one of the biggest aspect which I realized was that I was not living in accordance with natural laws.  I became more and more interested in the subject (philosophy) and wanted to acquire knowledge in a structured and methodical manner.  I did not want to read random & often uncorroborated articles on internet, which in my opinion can do more harm than good.  Hence I enrolled for Master of Arts, Philosophy program from Indira Gandhi National Open University, an accredited university.  I was fortunate enough to successfully complete the course (I was having a busy time at office as well) in December 2016.  Subjects like Logic, Metaphysics, Epistemology, Philosophy of Religion, Western Philosophy etc. helped in shifting my perspective towards life (& everything).  During the course tenure, got a glimpse of almost all branches of Philosophy.  This course is an introduction to the subject of Philosophy post which one can specialize or super-specialize in a chosen field.  Philosophical concepts shook the very foundations of belief which I held for a long time.  I had to unlearn many aspects before embarking on the journey.\nI lived in UK for a year (2018-19) and was lucky enough to enroll and successfully complete a 12 week online course on Ethics offered by University of Oxford.   \nIn the Master of Arts course, we had a brief introduction to Stoicism which was a part of the subject “Western Philosophy”.  I have seen a few videos introducing Stoicism and also have read a few articles on same.  I feel that Stoicism, if understood and applied, can enrich our lives and make for a peaceful living.  However, I would like to learn from experts and in a methodical / structural way.   The main objective to enroll is to enhance the quality of life which I am leading.  I am quite keen to understand the philosophy as I have read that it has helped a lot of individuals improve their lives.\nI am a Hindu by Birth.  I used to unquestioningly follow the religious rites and rituals till few years back.  My parents are devout Hindus.  I like to categorize myself as an “Agnostic”.  I firmly believe that it is not possible to rationally explain regarding existence / non-existence of a Supreme Being.  Hindu Polytheism in its present form, I would say the de-railed version of sublime Hindu philosophy.  I want to make sure that my children grow up as Agnostic.  I do not impose religion on them as I believe that they should critically think and then be able to choose a path that serves them the best.\nAlthough, I grew up in an environment where polytheism is widely accepted and believed.  I am Irreligious.  Religion is a social construct and has a limited use in overall scheme of things.  Having said that I would like to mention that I am not hostile towards religion as I believe that religion provides us with a platform and initial inputs to explore the “Nature of Reality”.   It is we who get stuck in the rites and rituals aspects and do not move beyond.  Religion cannot be blamed for that. \nAdi Shankaracharya, the proponent of Non-dualistic philosophy was a great Philosopher India has produced and his works are widely read in west as well.  He has explained Vedas and Upanishads in a simple way, which can be understood by common man and in the process authored many books. Although not conclusive, the available evidence is pointing towards Non Dual explanation of the Nature of Reality.  He asks us to question and accept only those facts which have a rational or evidential explanation.  The way science is progressing, in maybe a 100 – 150 years, man will be able to explain the origin of universe.  \n\nI have quite a busy schedule at work.  However, my hunger towards more knowledge is increasing too.  If admitted to the course, I will be putting in maximum effort in order to make it worthwhile for the college as well as for myself.\n\n', 1, '2020-02-23', 0, 0, 0, '', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', 0, 0, '', '');

I grew up in a small town of less than 10,000 people. I was born and raised in this town, and in fact I still live there with my parents. I really enjoy it. I consider it a small gem in my state that not many people know about. It’s surrounded by nature and has a beautiful downtown area, packed full of authentic restaurants. We have no fast food, no strip malls, no urban sprawl, no excessive billboards and advertisement; it’s peaceful. The public school system forms a tight knit community with small class sizes and an excellent staff. Bullying and anything of the sort is minimal compared to larger schools elsewhere in the country. The location of the town is also something to be mentioned. The closest major city is an easy one hour drive away, some smaller cities are 20 minutes away, the beach is a 25 minute drive, the mountains are close, and we are surrounded by rivers and trails to explore endlessly. It’s the perfect home base in my opinion. I consider myself lucky to have been raised there by a loving family. \n\nMy parents have been happily married for my whole life, no doubt a blessing in this day and age where broken families are so common. They did a good job raising me and my brother, keeping us from making any horrible life choices. My dad is an industrial electrician and general handyman. He loves working with his hands. He essentially built our house by himself, along with his prized garage where he stores his vast arsenal of tools. Any time he isn’t at work he likes to be at home building a rock wall, renovating a room in our house, refurbishing an old car in the garage, etc. I reckon he instilled in me the value of hard work, discipline, and the pursuit of perfection, along with other good habits such as thoroughly researching everything that I do or buy. I love working with my hands and solving problems, no doubt inspired by him. \n\nMy mom has had a few jobs, such as working at a flower shop, being an elementary school teacher’s assistant, paralegal work, and now a secretary at the elementary school. She loves nature, going on walks, and working in her garden. She urged my brother and me to be Boy Scouts, and we both achieved the rank of Eagle Scout while learning valuable outdoor skills along the way. I attribute her to my love for exploring the outdoors and curiosity of nature. She also instilled in me the value of being financially smart, organized, and responsible. \nFor the most part, I was kept quite sheltered all throughout my childhood. I didn’t have a whole lot of friends, but the ones I did have were very close and I spent copious amounts of time with them. I was always quiet and shy, especially in elementary school. The thought of making new friends, talking to pretty girls, or drawing attention to myself in general was scary, unthinkable. I’ve come out of my shell tremendously since then, but still it takes me a while to warm up to new people unless we just “click” right away. \n\nI should also mention that I was a late bloomer to the max. I never hit my major growth spurt until freshmen year of college. To this day, I look young for my age and people mistake me for being 17, 18, 19 years old. So  in high school, I always felt a bit behind physically, and socially as well. I made no effort to improve my poor posture, clothing style, or whacky hairstyle. I had one close friend in high school who I spent a lot of time with. We were both socially awkward. We got along great. We used to go on long drives together and just talk and listen to music, or go out in the woods and have campfires. He was a bit angsty in some ways, but so was I. Especially towards my parents. I was unpleasant to them, acting like an entitled brat and taking them for granted all the time. I would always be grumpy at dinner and loathe doing things with them if I didn’t feel like it. That’s not to say that our relationship was horrible. For the most part we got along fine. Typical teenager stuff, really. But I had that attitude for a long time, longer than most probably… I didn’t really start improving on it until my later years of college. \n\nHigh school graduation marked an important distinction in my life. It was the point where I drifted away from my bubble of sheltered innocence. My best friend from high school, who I mentioned earlier, introduced me to marijuana.  I loved it and quickly became a stoner. My friend and I would smoke every day. Again, in my school days I was never influenced by crime, drugs, alcohol, or bad influences. Yet I was always interested in mischief and practical jokes, challenging myself to take part in mischief without getting caught. I was exhilarated by it. So when I discovered weed, I think I enjoyed the danger aspect of it more than anything. Keeping my smoking habit a secret from my parents was a constant challenge. It made me feel cool. I’ll never forget those first times smoking and feeling so nervous, yet vividly alive.\n\nWhen I went to college, I felt like I could reinvent myself. I was still socially awkward in many ways, but I made huge progress coming out of my shell and making friends. I started drinking and partying with my new college friends who I met in the dorms. And for the first time I was interacting with pretty girls! Big progress. For me, college was a time of trying new things, going on adventures, exploring drugs, building my fitness, and expressing myself in ways that I never had before. I was discovering life. I remember freshmen year, my friend and I would venture out to the bike trail every night and talk about deep things in the topics of space and psychology. I had a very heavy mind in those times. I loved thinking deeply and discussing the mysteries of Mother Nature and the universe. That mentality never left me. To this day I am just baffled by the complexity of everything… life, evolution, space, and the infinite range of reality from the microscopic scale to the macroscopic. It’s wonderful to be a human being, experiencing it all.\n\nAnyways, beyond the typical college self-discovery mumbo jumbo, I did very well in my college classes. I made the Dean’s list every semester and I always got positive attention from my professors. I was working hard and excelling through my engineering courses. Calculus and physics were probably my favorite courses. I found it immensely satisfying to solve difficult problems in math, and furthermore I found it interesting how life’s everyday phenomenon could be defined by equations. \n\nMy junior year, I really started improving socially and I came out of my shell like never before. I had several close friends who I hung out with, and I finally lost my virginity after years of teenage horniness and unbridled lust. During this time, the first semester of junior year, I made the best decision of my life: I applied to study abroad in Sweden. And I got accepted. On January 14, 2016 I got on the plane and headed off for Europe. \nMy study abroad semester totally transformed my mentality. The people I met inspired me to be better. I remember when I first arrived at my apartment, I could hear my floor mates all hanging out and meeting each other in the common area. It took me something like four days to gain the courage to go out there and introduce myself. But by the end of the six month trip my confidence was at an all-time high after forcing myself to leave my comfort zone frequently throughout the trip. My friend Juan from Colombia taught me to dress better, and to hold myself high with good posture. My friend Jesus from Mexico showed me how to act confidentially as a man. My friend Josh from Chicago showed me how to go out and have an amazing time by talking to everyone and not taking yourself too seriously. By traveling to 13 countries throughout Europe during this time, I learned valuable skills of independence and street smarts. \n\nAround the middle of my trip, while on a cruise around the Baltic Sea which took me from Stockholm, to Tallinn, to St. Petersburg, to Helsinki, I met a beautiful women from Finland. I went with her to Rome at the end of my trip and she became my first girlfriend. I considered this a large achievement for myself given my shy nature in years prior. Anyways, upon coming home I felt like a completely changed man. And certainly more mature than when I left. \n\nIn fact, when I got home my relationship with my parents was immediately better. I became more open with them about my marijuana use and the fact that I was drinking and partying at college, and they accepted that. I realized that I didn’t have to be so mysterious and secretive with them. It felt amazing to be more open. My brother and I, who had a rocky relationship throughout our teenage years, finally started to reconcile. We didn’t get along at all throughout middle school and high school, and most of the time we acted like each other didn’t exist. But finally I was able to talk to him like a normal human being at least. At college I acted more confidentially, and my friends said I came back with a totally improved style and swagger. I wanted to continue my trend of self-improvement. \nSo I started making some big goals. Priority #1 was to go on another big trip. My long distance Finnish girlfriend was planning on studying abroad in Australia during the first semester of 2018, and I knew I would be graduated by then, so I told her I would go to Australia to live with her. Second, I wanted to be an entrepreneur. I hated my summer job working for a construction contractor because it just felt like a waste of time where I was wearing down my body for nothing. I made all the necessary arrangements and did all the research so that when I finished my second semester of senior year, I was able to start my first business the summer of 2017. Rocco Detailing. My last goal was to have something valuable to do in my spare time, a side project of sorts. My buddy from college and I started a project where we made videos of interesting people from different backgrounds. It was called WF. It never really took off but it was a fun project nonetheless. \n\n	Rocco Detailing was a sole-proprietorship car detailing service. I would drive around to my customers locations, whether it be their drive way or place of business, and clean the interior of their cars. I kept all the tools I needed in the trunk of my car. It had a slow start, but after I got an article about myself and my business published in the local newsletter, my phone started ringing off the hook. I worked through the whole summer, and into my final semester of college which I took at a community college. I saved up enough money to fund my half-year excursion in Australia. \n\n	Immediately after graduating I set off for my trip. I started in Mexico, where I visited my buddy Jesus who I met in Sweden. I spent about two weeks there before going to Australia. I spent a lot of time making a WF video which strived to show the real soul of Mexico so that people could see what it’s like there beyond the stereotypes and resorts. From there, I went to Australia where my girlfriend and I lived happily for 4 months or so. While there I continued making videos, which introduced me to a lot of unique people. I also took up surfing as a hobby, and began reading books like crazy. My girlfriend, an expert dancer, taught me how to salsa dance and we went to weekly dancing socials where we met lots of great people. I even got the chance to go to New Zealand for a week and a half. We had plans on finishing our trip in Indonesia and Thailand, but about 3 weeks prior to traveling there we had a nasty breakup. I was completely heartbroken by her actions. My ego was shattered into a million pieces. I cut my losses and bought a one way ticket to Bangkok. \n\n	I had always wanted to visit Thailand, especially after working at a Thai restaurant during my senior year of college. My Thai coworkers made it out to be the best place in the world, and they were not bluffing. I met lots of unforgettable people while backpacking around the country who I feel forever indebted to for helping me through a hard time. While bonding with others, I also picked up the pieces of my shattered self and started rebuilding from the foundation up. I am the type of person who likes to learn from his mistakes, and I know that what happened with my ex was in large part due to my own flaws. I started writing introspectively, and truly made an effort to know myself. During a seven day meditation retreat on a jungle island, I used the advice of the Buddhist monk to heal myself. I made the decision to forgive myself and to work on my flaws that I had identified through the breakup with my girlfriend. I realized many things, such as how I had been mistreating my parents for so long. My path of self-improvement became abundantly clear. And I felt more spiritual than ever.  \nAfter my meditation retreat, I was set to stay for another few weeks but I felt the need to go home early and be with my family. I was able to keep some good habits for a while, like daily meditation sessions and healthy eating, but I quickly became re-Americanized and went into somewhat of a downward spiral. I started partying, drinking, chasing girls, and smoking weed like crazy while losing my sense of spirituality. This led to me making some poor decisions that I won’t get into, but luckily I came out of that downward spiral without major incident beyond a shitty tattoo that I regret getting. \n\nOne thing led to another, and I got my life back on track. I realized that I needed to put my engineering degree to good use to pay off my student loans ASAP. I called up an old buddy from college and he hooked me up with a sweet job as a technical service provider for a company that sells machinery used in the pulp and paper industry. I started this job in February of this year. I really like it because I get to travel to places that I otherwise would never get the chance to see. So far I’ve traveled to both sides of Canada, throughout several states in the South of America, and most recently to the Irkutsk region of Siberia where I’m writing this essay now. In general, I’m away from home for 70% or more of the time. \n\nAnother thing I like about this job is the challenge that it provides me. My job is to supervise construction workers who are installing the machinery that my company sells. I have to learn everything about the machinery and know exactly how each component fits together. Everyday I’m faced with perplexing problems that must be solved. There’s no two ways about it; the show must go on and it’s my task to make it go smoothly as possible. I also have to make big decisions constantly, which could cause major failures if I go with the wrong choice. Often times these decisions need to be made in a split second without time to think it over. Another challenge I face is that I’m a young boyish looking guy with a college degree, and I’m dealing with seasoned construction workers from different cultures who have been doing mechanical work for their entire lives. You best believe they test me every chance they get to see if they can intimidate me. And because they have more experience in mechanical labor than I do, they constantly try to defy what I say despite the fact that I know more about the specific machinery than them. Other challenges include the long work hours. 12 to 14 hours a day with no day off until the project is finished, sometimes for weeks on end. I have very little spare time to pursue my goals, and it’s difficult to eat healthy and workout as much as I like. And the traveling itself is a challenge. Go somewhere, make a bunch of new friends and acquaintances, then leave and possibly never see them again. Get on an airplane and start all over again somewhere else. Plus I’m rarely home so I don’t get to spend a lot of time with my family or hometown friends. \n\nBut I welcome these challenges with open arms. The way I see it, each challenge mentioned above is building my frame. Making me stronger, sharper, more resilient, more self-reliant and independent. Giving me an unshakeable foundation that I can utilize in everyday life. For example, talking to a beautiful women at the bar isn’t so intimidating now that I have experience arguing with a hot tempered 6 foot 7 Russian guy who wants to throw me over the side of the scaffolding. I see that as valuable life experience. And the fact that I get so much of it from this job is perfect for one my top goals: Become a stronger man. Conform to nature by embracing and building my masculinity. \n\nAnd that leads to the mentality that I hold right now in the present. I’ve regained my post-Thailand attitude of self-improvement, but now I feel as though I can sustain the endeavor since I am more mentally stable now. As part of my self-improvement I’ve decided that I want to build a solid foundation consisting of the following aspects: Fitness, Stoicism, reading and writing, entrepreneurship. For each of these I have outlined several short term and long terms goals to work on in my spare time.\n\n I started by designing a fitness routine that I can motivate myself to do while working such long hours. My goal is to complete my routine 3 times a week, and continuously set new goals to conquer. \nStoicism is something I’ve known about for a while but I’ve never researched it until recently. I am extremely interested in learning more about this way of life, as I think it can help me improve myself significantly. It really speaks to me because many of my personally developed philosophies line up closely with Stoicism. My goal right now is to complete the SES course, and possibly the Marcus Aurelius course if the SES course turns out to be worthwhile. \n\nReading and writing is part of my foundational set for obvious reasons. One of the best ways to build knowledge and make yourself more interesting is by reading books. So I want to start reading more when I have spare time, such as sitting in the airport terminal or on the plane. This will be a better use of my time than giving attention to distractions such as my phone. And writing has always interested me. I would like to write books in the future, so I have outlined a few short term and long term goals to get myself in the habit of writing regularly while improving my skill. \n\nEntrepreneurship is very important to me as well. While I am really enjoying my current job, I absolutely do not intend to spend my entire life being bossed around. I thoroughly enjoyed running my detailing business and I want to build more businesses in the near future. My plan is to research and build the foundation of a simple business which I can expand on in the year of 2020. Which leads me to my final point of this autobiography, my plan for the future. \n\nMy plan is simple. Phase 1: Continue my current job until December 2020. During this time, I will pay off my student loans, and save up a significant amount of money for use in the future. Phase 2: Quit my job and get an apartment in Colombia for six months to a year. I’ve always wanted to visit Colombia and I want to go on one more long-term trip before I settle down. During this time, I will also do short term trips throughout South America so I can experience more countries and cultures. To support myself I will run a “digital nomad” type business, which I am currently working on setting up. Then Phase 3 will be to move back to America, possibly to a major city like NYC, or to one of the smaller cities nearby my parents. There I will settle down (for a while at least) and use the money that I saved in Phase 1 to start a more permanent business. \n\nAnd that’s the story of my life, my autobiography. I hope it wasn’t too hard to get through. Cheers. \n\nHow long you have been interested in Stoicism.\nAbout 2 months now.\n\nAny books you read on Stoic philosophy. If any, please list them.\nI’ve read a few passages from Meditations, and the first 15 of Seneca’s letters. \n\nWould you call yourself an atheist, agnostic/skeptic, deist, theist?\nI would call myself a pantheist. \n\nAre you a member of a religious faith? If so, which and for how long?\nNo.\n\nHave you studied philosophies other than Stoicism? If so, which?\nI took an intro to philosophy class in community college. We did an overview of all the main ideas of philosophy, including the range of opinion and where the major schools of philosophy fell on the range. \n\nDo you consider yourself to be a Stoic?\nI consider myself to be on the path to being a Stoic. Though I don’t think I’m nearly at the point where I can call myself a Stoic. \n\nWhat you want to get from this course.\nI want to build a solid foundation regarding the core principles of Traditional Stoicism. I am really interested in making Stoicism a major part of my life, and I think this SES course will be a good place to begin my studies. \n\n', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, '', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', 0, 0, '', ''),

I was born into a stable middle class family in Southern California, USA.  I have always had good relationships with my family and friends.  I met the love of my life at age 17 and have worked hard to maintain a good marriage.  I have two sons, ages 17 and 19.  I have always enjoyed a very active intellectual life. \n\nFour years ago, my world was hit by tragedy.  Or maybe that’s what someone not familiar with Stoicism would call it.  It’s a tough task finding a way to be grateful for a “gift of providence” that tears a life to pieces.  Every possible dark thought one could have took hold of me.  While the facts of the tragedy have not changed and the struggles and aftermath are still dealt with on a daily basis, my thoughts are much better.  My life is once again reasonably good.  I am very proud of this fact because my life could very easily have turned out another way.  My decision to apply to this course is with the intention to continue to strengthen my ability to deal with the events in life that are beyond my control.\n\nHow long have you been interested in Stoicism?\n\nMy interest in philosophy, mythology, literature and religion is very broad and I have studied most of the major ones to varying degrees.  To specifically address Stoicism, I was first introduced to some of the major works in high school.  This would be approximately 30 years ago as I am currently 49 years old.  I read the Harvard Classics volume which contains Socrates’s Apology, The Golden Sayings of Epictetus, The Meditations of Marcus Aurelius and have revisited this volume several times over the subsequent years.\n\nList the books you have read on Stoic philosophy:\n\nIn addition to the volume listed above, I have read selections from Seneca\'s letters and Hadot’s The Inner Citadel.  I’ve also been reading the Discourses of Epictetus in the past few months as I have been re-focusing my attention back on Stoicism.\n\nWould you call yourself an atheist, agnostic/skeptic, deist, theist?\n\nI’ve never been fond of calling myself anything but if put to task I would pick deist.  The Stoic idea of god is my kind of god...natural, imminent and dismissed with at our own peril.  \n\nAre you a member of a religious faith? If so, which and for how long?\n\nNo, although I have studied Christianity and Buddhism fairly extensively.\n\nHave you studied philosophies other than Stoicism? If so, which?\n\nWhile I have made attempts many times over many years, there just never really seemed to be any practical application to the study of philosophy.  Digging too far into the academic side of things becomes too sterile for my taste.  I’m not a fan of simply arguing over ideas and ideology where nothing is gained other than the short term pleasure of dominating an opponent with rhetorical flourishes.  I also could never really see real world examples of academics whose lives benefited from their philosophical studies.  It all seemed like an area filled with master chefs who don\'t eat their own cooking.  Literature seems to be a much more practical application of philosophy since as a reader, you are able to spend more time seeing the effects on a character’s life as a result of a certain line of thinking.\n\nDo you consider yourself to be a Stoic?\n\nOnce again, I’m not fond of calling myself anything.  That being said, I feel I have spent decades narrowing down what I believe to be true and helpful in this life and Stoicism appears to be ticking all the boxes without any bloated baggage that tends to accompany other schools of thought.  I would say that I currently consider myself to be attempting to follow the Stoic path.\n\nWhat you want to get from this course?\n\nAs mentioned above briefly, I want this course to help me with my ability to deal with events outside my control.  More specifically, I am looking to change my focus from learning to practice.  I feel that I have done the research, checked the reviews and found the path I want to fully commit to following.  I have spent far too much time over the course of my life going down different rabbit holes but always remaining a competent amateur in many different schools of thought and left with a scattered mind.  I want to have a simple yet solid structure to look to, fall back on and find comfort in.  I believe Stoicism is that structure.  I am grateful that there are so few surviving ancient Stoic texts.  Where some may see this as limiting, I see this as liberating.  \n\nWhile I have cobbled together what I call my Personal Scripture over the years (composed of a selection of different books that I try to reread on a regular basis), I am ready to have a much more focused and disciplined practice to follow.  Both Marcus and Seneca discuss the idea that constant learning is a distraction from the real work of practice. This was really the catalyst that made me decide to stop and try to develop a specific plan to follow and practice.  This has been a major problem for me most of my life.  I look back and see that I have always been someone who would rather engage in the intellectual exercise of learning than actually practicing and risking failure.  I played tournament chess for many years and I found this dilemma always staring me in the face and preventing progress.   \n\n I am also looking forward to having some help from a live human as I proceed in this course.  This is a pretty big departure for me.  Intellectual activities tend to be pretty solitary affairs which has always suited me just fine.  It has also been pretty rare that I have found someone in my circle of friends, family or professional colleagues that share the same intellectual interests as myself.  As I’ve gotten older, I’m trying to reach out and share a bit more.  \n', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, '', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', 0, 0, '', ''),

I apologize in advance for the language mistakes, even though I consider myself proficient in English, is not my first language.', 'I was born in the 21st of may 1984 at Rio de Janeiro in a fairly regular middle class household, I was raised as a single child (had a sister from my fathers second marriage around 2000) and was first enrolled in a Montesori school but after learning how to read (because of the high costs) my parents transferred me to a catholic school near my fathers business (he owned a drugstore), I stayed in this catholic school until I finished high school.\n\nAt around 7 my parents divorced but kept being friends, at the time I didn’t realize how much of my father’s distance affected me but is something that came up a latter time as he regretted not being more affectionate and close to me during my childhood.\n\nThe school was very small and soon before puberty I started being left out by other boys, at that time any reason would suffice for children to bully over one another. Around maybe 12 years old I had my first contact with the internet and quickly became an avid user. That helped me in some way to cope with the loneliness of being bullyied and staying alone at home since both of my parents worked.\n\nI felt drawn for contra-cultural thoughts and around 13 I was already considered “that weird kid that is always reading some fiction and is into weird music”. That was the first time I got in contact with the punk culture. I lived a very sheltered life and didn’t had contact with actual street punk living until I was way older but I felt drawn by the rhetoric.\n\nUntil my late 20 I still lived a teenage lifestyle, lived with my mom and was supported by my parents. I started attending groups related to my interests at around 16 (comics, Japanese animation, fantasy novels, roleplaying games), and at 18 (even though I took more than a decade to realize this about myself) I started becoming a central figure in this groups as I was good at coordinate people, to think things through and organization.\n\nAround the same time (early 20) I attended a Social Sciences college (a mix of Anthropology, Sociology and Political Sciences) but dropped out two years later because I felt no perspective of working and didn’t feel the course challenging enough.\n\nAround my early 20 I also started attending gothic and electronic music parties, after a couple of years I became DJ of the most popular parties playing EBM (electro body music), that gave me the opportunity to express myself visually with shocking clothing and accessories. This interest also got me close to German culture, and after some tweaks of the destiny I went to Dresden (Germany) for a one month German course and traveled a bit around Europe by myself. My parents already had taken me to a eurotrip when I was little (1990) and I think this influenced me in some way.\n\nAt 24 I started law school which I finished 7 years later (the expected time to complete the course is 5 years), my finishing work to get my degree was on civil disobedience and how unlawful and unfairly anarchist protestors were being persecuted by the police and judiciary system. I was very praised by the college teachers that evaluated my work. Right afterward I passed the bar exam and at the end of 2015 I became officially a Lawyer even though I struggle with working in this field due not only to emotional reasons but also (and mainly) because of Brazilian economical crisis.\n\nIn 2010 I attended a course on a school of philosophy/magick called Collegium ad Lux et Nox. The course was based on the eastern esoteric tradition, in particular the tools of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn. I already had interest in the esoteric world since my first contact with it around 15, but I never pressed the subject too much. After the one year course in CALEN (Collegium ad lux at nox) I underwent a initiation ceremony called “lux ceremony”.\n\nIn 2013 Rio de Janeiro was stage of a movement similar to Arab spring or occupy wallstreet and I was drawn to this protests and organization and found myself right in the center of the storm. That period of couple of months was very impacting in my life and changed completely the way I saw the democratic institutions, mainly the police. In Brazil the police is extremely violent. In Rio more people are killed by firearms conflict than in Afghanistan.\nIn 2015 by some coincidences of the destiny I joined the Collegium ad Lux et Nox as a collaborating member and still work there as a regional president. It’s a voluntary work.\n\nAround the middle of 2016 I was accepted as a probationer in the Astrum Argentum Fraternity and after one and a half year was admitted as a Neophyte. The self initiation ritual I underwent after this period of intense practice and meditation was probably one of the most important moments in my life. Between 2016 and 2018 I also was a “second order member” of a revival of the hermetic order of the golden dawn, leaving the order due to not agreeing with the management of it.\n\n\nAt the end of 2017 I moved away from my mothers house and started living with my girlfriend. \n\nAt 2018 I was initiated in the freemasonry but currently am away from this duties due to personal problems. In early 2018 I read an article by a friend and borther in faith of mine (Alan Willms) about stoicism, I found it interesting but didn’t gave much of attention, later in that year the same friend commented on how Stoicism helped him with his anxiety and that peaked my interest. I’m used to watching a lot of youtube videos regarding history, philosophy, psychology, and after a while youtube started recommending me videos about Stoicism, I watched a couple and started to get really interested in it. I brought the Enchiridion by Epictetus and read it quickly.\n\nTwo months ago my father told me he was diagnosed with ALS a degenerative disease in its most aggressive form that gives him about two years average of life expectancy with treatment and has no cure. I introduced stoicism to my father and despite him not going deep into it he felt very positive, I lend him the enchiridion and he read but gave me back without much demand for more. I also introduced (through videos) stoicism to my girlfriend.\nAround February 2019 I started looking for Psychotherapy to deal with my crippling anxiety, it was the second time I looked for psychotherapy, this time Jungian psychoanalysis. Still am working and improved my life in a huge way, particularly understanding the kind of anxiety I have (social anxiety disorder) as well as my personality as an introvert and the consequences of this in my life. I found new strength realizing the thought patterns that drove me to being afraid of everything.\n\nStill in 2019 with the election of a fascist president and the rise of violence and economic crisis I had a disturbing dream that lead me to think about having children and this thought lead me to the idea of moving away from Brazil to another country, I decided to start learning computer programing as this would be a way to be incorporated into the labor market anywhere.\n\nI see myself now as a very dedicated theist, following the religion Thelema, not only as a personal belief but also promoting the Thelemic thinking trough essays, classes, podcast, religious festivals, gatherings and such, I’m deeply involved in my faith practicing it every single day and keeping a detailed journal of my practices. I started practicing Thelema with his role in my life since 2015 but already am considered a prominent member of my religious community. I also work as sorts of teacher of facilitator to other members that wish to join the Astrum Argentum Fraternity.\n\nEven though I do not consider myself a stoic person, I always had a big problem with authority figures, even symbolic ones, and that made an impact on my life as this characteristic joined my anxiety and prevented me to see myself as an authority figure that other people would look up to. This lead me to a sheltered life as I felt nervous not understanding why some people craved to be my friends, to please and get my attention. After reading some more about stoicism and in particular the life of Marcus Aurelius, I started to build my own symbolic relation to this idea of the “philosopher-king” and that allowed me to accept that people look up to me as someone intelligent and fair, that has strong ethics and does his best to live up to it.\n\nI have not studied philosophy other than Thelema, at least not in a dedicated way. I surely had philosophy classes both in school and in college and have a general notion of schools of thought and the idea of thinking, but still nothing that I would consider myself knowledgeable in the subject.\n\nI don’t consider myself to be stoic but I look forward to see how I can integrate stoic thought into my life and practice. I see a great point of contact with many of stoic concepts like “amor fati” and the “True Will” in Thelema, It also has brought much comfort to me thinking that there is no point in suffering for things that I have no control, and also that I can choose how events affect me.\n\nI thank you for the opportunity and the time invested in reading this and hope to hear from the college soon to start my course.\n', 1, '2020-06-27', 0, 0, 0, '', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', 0, 0, '', ''),

I\' m a 55 year old civil engineer working in the transportation industry in Central Florida.  I have been an engineer since 1987, so 32 years.  Specifically I am the Vice President of Water Resources in Florida for my company, Consor Engineers, LLC.  I have been married twice and am currently recently divorced.  I have three children,  David and Adam (33 & 30) from my first marriage and a 6 year old girl named Sabrina, from my second marriage, who I have joint custody with my ex-wife.  So I\'m a single father at age 55.   I am currently in a committed relationship of four years with a woman significantly younger than me(33).  We have been living together for the past two years.  I lead a very active life outside of work. I have been into athletics all my life and currently I compete in judo, jiujitsu and powerlifting.  I hold a black belt in judo and jiujitsu.  I enjoy all watching sports and am currently a season ticket holder of the Miami Dolphins ( not good right now! Tank!).  I\'m active with my daughter in her activities of dance and swimming and I hope to pass on my love of sports to her.\n\nI first became interested in Stoicism( after reading Ryan Holliday\'s, The Obstacle is the Way and Ego is the Enemy) during my divorce within the last three years in which it helped me a great deal coping with the stress during that very trying time.  Learning to only concern myself with things that I could control went a long way in keeping sanity during that two year process.  I also realized that I had already been living my life with some Stoic values already in place.  Constantly asking myself if this would matter in 5 years also helped tremendously during my divorce.  I can honesty say that these two items allowed me to persevere through it and come out whole in the end.  Also learning to live without attachments to material possession and money has been another way I resonated with Stoicism.  During my divorce I spent a great deal of money and lost a lot in terms of work assets.  Basically, Stoicism allowed me to say who cares.\n\nI have read several books on the subject of Stoicism including Meditations, Discourses, Letters from a Stoic, How to Die and On the Shortness of Life.  I have also read all of Ryan Holliday\'s books, The Obstacle is the Way, Ego is the Enemy, and The Daily Stoic. He has a new one coming out in October entitled Stillness.  Other books I have read are from Donald Robertson ( How to Think Like a Roman Emperor,  Stoicism and the Art of Happiness) and William Irvine ( The Stoic Challenge and How to Live the Good Life).  I have the Inner Citadel but haven\'t been able to dig into that yet. It seems to be very academic and I just have not been able to dive in to that type writing.  It\'s been awhile since school.  \n\nIn terms of religion I classify myself as an agnostic; I believe in a higher being I just don\'t know what that is. When I look at universe I just can\'t bring myself to say or feel that there is not something greater than me out there.  Maybe we are just fish in someone\'s fish bowl but I know something had to create this thing of a universe.  I was loosely raised in the Methodist Church as a kid but after leaving for college I rarely attend any organized church services. My father was very religious and this always created distance between us.  My first wife was Catholic so I gained exposure to her religion and became familiar with the differences between Protestant and Catholics.  I found that Catholicism was tolerable as opposed to the some the Protestant services I attended as a kid.  My second wife was Muslim so there again I got to be exposed to another religion. I traveled in the Middle East and saw the religion first hand. With all of exposures to religion I have come to conclusion that I do not want to be associated with any organized "man-made" religion and feel they have just gotten it wrong.  I think that a majority of the world\'s problems can to traced back to "man-made" religions.  I have also studied a little Buddhism and Zen and actually spent a weekend in the Catskills Mountains at a Buddhist monastery.  We spent the entire weekend meditating and doing mundane chores around the grounds.  I actually really enjoyed the experience.  I have an affinity forward to the East due to my martial arts background and these religions do resonate with me.  I also got to experience Eastern Religions firsthand when I traveled to Japan.  There is a certain peace there that is not present here in the states.  Currently, I am not a member of any religious faith at this time and do not plan on ever being one.\n\nI have never formally studied any other philosophies but have an interest in them.  I am familiar with several others and their key players but have never dug into any of them.  As you know with social media you can bombard yourself with quotes from all the philosophies if you choose.  So my knowledge of them is based off social media ( scary). I have actually considered enrolling in college and pursuing courses in various philosophies  but have not been able to make the time commitment.  I would rather have something more easily accessed form home and a little more tailored to my wishes.\n\nIn my limited studies, I have taken a great affinity towards Stoicism and I do now call myself a Stoic or at least a Stoic in Training. I can relate to the overall concepts and see direct correlations of how it can improve my personal life, especially my mental well being.  I have also come to see how Stoic philosophy relates to sports and how it could be used very effectivity in my competitive sporting endeavors.  Especially as I age and have to come to grips with my body aging and slowing down.  I also love history and to see how this related to several historical figures has also been very enjoyable to me.\n\nHopefully by taking this course and others I can deepen my knowledge of Stoicism and learn ways to improve my life.  Currently my knowledge of Stoicism has been confined to self learning through books and social media.  I have no opportunity to discuss the subject matter with others and participate in helpful debates.  I also know I would benefit from a structured syllabus and assignments to hold myself accountable to do the work.  Additionally I am sure I probably am getting some of it wrong and would like the benefit of having a guide or mentor during this journey.\n', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, '', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', 0, 0, '', '');

I was raised in a secular home with occasional attendance at Catholic services with friends. Arriving at university comfortably agnostic, I availed myself of all of the courses on religion available and completed a philosophy minor weighted toward ethics and epistemology. Through both religion and philosophy coursework, I’ve tried to survey the continental, East Asian, and American new thought traditions. Recently, I have been interested in Ada Agada’s consolation philosophy as an attempt at a non-colonial African philosophy resonant in post-colonial Africa.  Armed with a newly descriptive lexicon, I came to be able to describe myself as a pragmatist yearning for virtue and subscribed to a philosophical Buddhist worldview and practices (which still provide some support regulating my emotions and framing my interactions with others some 12 years later). Through a spiritual teacher, I have developed a mantra practice and the perspective of a non-religious deist, though I remain humble and skeptical about the epistemic limits of human perception and reason and am eager to explore the veracity of different traditions’ conception of the spiritual.\n\nPosidonius of Rhodes emphasized the interdependence of all parts of a whole. The same/similar concept resides within Buddhism and Taoism, which I interpret at the level of the person to include past experience. My family was not from expansive means, but my sibling and I never went without food, clothing, or shelter. We did want for safety and stability; one parent was abusive and the other abused, resolving when I was 14 through a welcomed divorce. I have participated in mental health counseling in the past, and continue to do so periodically as an adult. The trait anxiety I carry, instilled by my home life, and a consistent struggle to perceive others’ emotions clearly, deliver daily opportunities to apologize, receive grace, and hone the way I walk in the world as a member of a whole community/culture/society/species. As this is part of who I was/am, I am drawn to the apparent power of stoicism to be the way all of I am in the present moment.\n\nDriven by the empathy naturally derived from proximity to suffering (a drive I recognize only now through hindsight), I’ve gravitated to work in helping professions, in technician roles in a hospital, a clinic, and on an ambulance, then leadership in that clinic and teaching in a health professions program at a university. When I moved with my spouse from a large urban area to a rural community, I left behind the teaching portion of my job and brought with me the administrative work. Longing for more proximity to those I seek to help after 4 years working administratively at a distance, I’m continuing part-time remote administrative and curricular work for a health professions university while working in-person as a mental health crisis worker. I recently found a term that seems to capture my relationship to this work broadly: Henri Nouwen’s ‘wounded healer’. From my formative traumatic experiences comes a drive almost outside myself to serve those who suffer. \n\nTo every thing there is a season; my first exposure to stoic thought was just after graduating high school, but while interesting I was not ready to sit under cover of the porch and learn. A philosophy class on antiquity provided some academic orientation to the stoics, but again the winds were coming from the wrong direction. In January of this year, forlorn over having let myself be driven into an administrative job laboring distant from those I sought to help, I turned to the stoic tradition for wisdom. I’ve read the Internet Encyclopedia article on stoicism, followed the Daily Stoic, and listened to audio/video lectures on stoic ideals, journaling my thoughts and processing my burgeoning understanding. I’ve had a number of fertile and challenging conversations with my father-in-law, a professional counselor and a long-time student of the stoics. I’ve not read any source material because my personal process has always been to start with contemporary re-telling and commentary and work back to original texts so I can immerse myself in them armed with a scaffold of the original work’s scope and ideas and features of the world in which the original authors wrote. I feel ready and eager to do that work now.\n\nIn my current work as a crisis worker, I’ve found the stoic practices of avoiding good/bad classifications and taking the view from above very helpful in sitting with people who are profoundly suffering. In reading about stoic practices, I’ve recognized I have always spontaneously experienced memento mori and premeditatio malorum (the latter much to the chagrin of my spouse) as ways to shift perspective and manage anxiety. As I grow older (if not wiser), I find myself inclined to temperance more than in the past, including with food which has long been my coping strategy of last resort. In these ways, I have long been sympathetic to what I understand to be the stoic approach to living in the world.\n\nI am applying with earnest enthusiasm to the School of Essential Studies because of three primary drives. First, after reflecting on my last 9 months of journal entries (and my memories of my adulthood to-date), I recognize that I struggle not with thoughts or words (if you’ll permit a moment of brashness) but with turning words into works. I believe the stoics hold great wisdom in this regard. Second, while I have employed the ideals of philosophical Buddhism for many years, my relationship with this tradition has been in the framework of duty ethics, and I have struggled to transform this perspective into the art of living in the moment. From my limited exposure to stoicism, I am enticed and enlivened by the way this philosophy is intentionally focussed on virtue and (it seems) fully realized and expressed through how we live in each moment. Third, I have long known myself to struggle without an external agent of accountability. I am specifically enthused by the design of the College: the gentle structure provided for students to encourage forward progress and the apparent Oxford tutorial-style student-mentor relationship. Of additional interest are the opportunities for further personal growth through the College via the MA school and the Fourth school, and the quality of practical philosophical writings in the eJournal and Scholarch’s Permanent Collection which reflects on the quality of mentoring. \n\nI hereby humbly submit my application to attend the School of Essential Studies.\n', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, '', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', 0, 0, '', ''),

Naturally, the podcast covered the Pax Romana and the rule of the Five Good Emperors. Much time was spent on Marcus Aurelius, his upbringing, education, ascension to the purple, and years of rule as he book-ended the period of peace. This was my initial exposure to Stoicism and seeing what man was truly capable of. Marcus Aurelius was an absolute ruler for 19 years and ruled with fortitude, discipline, justice, and wisdom. He was able to do so without disgracing himself as many other Roman emperors did, even counting his son among them. Wanting to know more about his philosophy and way of living, I picked up his Meditations. This was my gateway to Stoicism and its tenets. \n\nIn the few years that have passed since picking up the Meditations, I have reread it every year, though I have become exposed to the works of Epictetus and Seneca over the years as well. Reading works like the Enchiridion and On the Shortness of Life have given me a little breadth on how Stoicism was taught and implemented by other Roman philosophers. Between these 3, I realized how comprehensive of a way of life Stoicism was, the Emperor and a former slave could both equally participate in its formative ways about bringing a life that moves on in quiet and follows reason. I have yet to pick up some of the other well-known classical works like Letters to Lucilius or Discourses of Epictetus.  \n\nA more recently released book I picked up was “How to be a Stoic: Using an Ancient Philosophy to Live a Modern Life” by Massimo Pigliucci. I struggle with these recently released books as opposed to the classic literature of Stoic philosophers. Though that may be from attempting the books too early before I had a chance to read some of the works of other Stoics and learning about their lives. While I have not picked up any other such books recently, it has remained in the back of mind as I have gotten closer and closer to the idea of adopting Stoicism as a personal philosophy and committing myself to coming closer to understanding its teachings and more diligently practice them in my own life. \n\nAs for my spiritual/religious views, it is something I have always had a degree of distance from. Growing up my parents were Methodist by birth, though neither they nor I belonged to any sort of formal religious congregation growing up. Approaching my teens, I became more curious about what was out there and attended a few Catholic and Evangelical services, but nothing really stuck. Turning to Eastern Religions, as I had qualms about what I viewed as an omnipresent/omniscient monotheist deity, I studied Buddhism briefly. While I admire its followers and its ideals of following “the Middle Way” and using meditation as a methodology of training your mind, it still seemed a little too lofty for me. Thus, leaving my teens and entering adulthood and college, I sort of left the question of whether I fell into a specific religion in the air. Nonetheless, I still had a lot of incredulous feelings and misgivings about any sort of organized religion, having not had a lot of positive experiences with them thus far.\n\nI have since graduated college, moved on to a full-time career for the past few years, and married a wonderful woman who is Presbyterian, attending church essentially every Sunday growing up and still does to this day. As we dated and went on to marry, I went to and still go to church services with her. In our Presbyterian church we attend, I have found a great community who is welcoming, warm, and open to discussions about theology and spirituality. At this point in my life, I have come to comfortable terms with my spirituality and have become okay with essentially describing myself as a skeptical agnostic. I’m not quite sure about a higher power; at this point I’m more concerned with living a good life and letting whatever powers may be figure the rest out after my death. \n\nAfter some reflection, I realized that my failed attempts to find some sort of religious or spiritual home were because I didn’t feel I needed an explanation as to how we got here, or where we went after our deaths. What I needed in my life, was a comprehensive set of guidelines and examples of how to lead a good and virtuous life while we are here. This is an oversimplification, but at its core is what attracted me to Stoicism. For me, Stoicism addresses the very real facts of life, that we are going to face hardship and struggle, but that we have in our very own power the ability to rightly set our judgements about things we experience in life. I have some brief knowledge of Epicureanism in my research of Stoicism but came to reject it quickly due to its reliance of pleasure as the target for which its followers should aim for. In Stoicism alone, I finally felt as though I had found a pragmatic approach to living.\n\nAt this point though, I do not describe myself as a Stoic. I admire the ancient writings, and the examples they set as statesmen, emperors, and teachers. However, I do not have a comprehensive and complete understanding of the underlying logic, physics, and ethics that encompass Stoicism. Even my admiration of the Meditations is tempered by the knowledge that likely Marcus Aurelius never meant it for publication, and merely was writing a journal to himself to remind him of his Stoic duty. In this then, I don’t view it as a comprehensive manual to Stoicism, more as a tool of emulation for living a Stoic life. Therefore, not having a well-rounded understanding of Stoicism, I can’t claim that I am one. This is totally leaving out the fact that I still miss the mark in my own life in so many ways that I can also not claim in any way that I am living in accordance with nature and reason.  \n\nAs I have aged through my twenties and assumed the responsibilities of a career, family, and being a member of my local community, I have felt that it is time that I start living more consciously. I am not so much concerned about what will happen to me (whatever that is) after I am gone, but I want to start living a good life now. One paraphrased line from the Enchiridion comes to me almost daily:\n\n“… How long, then, will you put off thinking yourself worthy of the highest improvements and follow the distinctions of reason? … You are no longer a boy, but a grown man. If, therefore, you will be negligent and slothful, and always add procrastination to procrastination, purpose to purpose, and fix day after day in which you will attend to yourself, you will insensibly continue without proficiency, and, living and dying, persevere in being one of the vulgar. This instant, then, think yourself worthy of living as a man grown up, and a proficient. Let whatever appears to be the best be to you an inviolable law. And if any instance of pain or pleasure, or glory or disgrace, is set before you, remember that now is the combat, now the Olympiad comes on, nor can it be put off. By once being defeated and giving way, proficiency is lost, or by the contrary preserved. Thus Socrates became perfect, improving himself by everything. attending to nothing but reason. And though you are not yet a Socrates, you ought, however, to live as one desirous of becoming a Socrates.”\n\nFor what I expect to get from this course then, is a formal education on Stoicism. Its history, personal ethics, logic, and physics. I want to be taken through its founding in Athens by Zeno and development through the centuries. Furthermore, it seems that it has seen a lot of resurgence recently and I wouldn’t mind exploring those themes as well as to why people see it as a relevant way of living today – I certainly have my own reasons as to why I came to it. As much as I can, I want to begin living a life in accordance with reason. No longer tossed this way and that by the daily struggles we must encounter. I understand that to undertake this way of living is a lifelong commitment that requires work and patience, but at the end of my life I feel I would have known it’s worth it. If I can say that I lived a good life and utilized my time here to the best of my abilities to help further my community and be good to those around me, it will have been more than enough for me. In Stoicism I feel this is possible.\n', 1, '2020-04-24', 1, 0, 0, '', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '10 FEB 21.

She’d just gotten her first paying catering gig and I was with her to support her new venture. As with most Saturdays at Costco, the parking lot was a zoo. She had stopped her car behind another car that had stopped to let several shoppers cross, leaving us T-boned against one of the major parking alleys, where two or three cars were also lined up waiting to merge. \n\nSuddenly, the car perpendicular to us in the alley sped up and then stopped mere inches away from the passenger side door where I was sitting. Flinching nearly out of my seat, I swiveled to see two young women in the car gesturing rudely towards me. Surrounding their car were several startled and scared pedestrians who had nearly been run over. \n\nTurning my head back to the front of the car, I tried to calm down taking slow breaths. My wife appeared to be equally as shocked as I was.\n\nPresently, the car in front of us moved up and we were able to continue down the lane and away from the intersection. As we turned into get gas, my wife asked me, “Are you still carrying them?”\n\nI realized that my fear of almost being T-boned had turned into anger. “How dare they use a 1-ton weapon and aim it at me?” or “I wasn’t even driving, yet they were willing to ram me with their car?” or “I should have gotten out and asked for witnesses so I can pursue justice in court, surely there’s a law forbidding the intentional use of a car as a weapon.” and so forth \n\n The truth is it was too late by then, and more importantly, there was nothing I could have done about the behavior of the driver, only how I react to it. Using Epictitus’s quote to cope, I told myself, “Did they injure me? No. Did they maim me? No. Did they cripple me? No. Did they kill me? No. So then what is there to concern yourself with?”\n\nGranted, this whole process took several hours, meeting the thoughts of fear and anger with calm rationality. Surely, there can be no better training in philosophy than this. And surely there are an unlimited amount of these opportunities in one’s life.\n\nAt that time, I was in the middle of reading, “How to be a Stoic”, which, I think, helped me immensely. This represents a recent reading binge I started on Stoicism. In addition to my wife and I reading The Daily Stoic over tea each morning for the last two years, I’ve also read, How to Think Like a Roman Emperor, The Obstacle is the Way and a good translation of Meditations. \n\nDespite this interest, I find it incongruent to actually call myself a Stoic. I think this kind of labeling is exactly the opposite of being a real stoic. Philosophy is not worn as one’s identity but put into practice in onces thoughts, relationships, and life. I’m more inclined to call my self a skeptic, or a poetic naturalist. Though 10 years ago, I wouldn’t have. And perhaps it was my recent escape from a cult-like situation that makes me not want to label myself.\n\nSince I was 16, (I’m 41 now) I’ve been interested in practical philosophy, more specifically, those traditions in the east, like yoga and Buddhism. However, around 7 years ago, I realized that I was a Buddhist fundamentalist and hypocrite. Not only do I not believe in reincarnation and karma, but after 15 years of trying, I don’t think I ever will. During my time in Nepal and as a student of Buddhism, I encountered some of the worse of human behavior. \n\nTibetan friends of mine became Lamas (teachers) and promptly started abusing their power, starting with financial extortion, and often ending up raping emotionally fragile students. I’ve met victims of emotional abuse, mental breakdown, extortion and even rape in the Buddhist community and witnessed countless examples of racism, sexism and xenophobia. One Lama, who I still consider a close friend even though my Tibetan language has declined over the years, convinced me to finally leave it all behind, inadvertently, when he revealed to me that he actually thinks Guru Rinpoche lives in a mystical mountain made out of copper and actually comes to him when called or that leaving milk out on the alter while reciting some magic words has any causality in the real world. \n\nI’m embarrassed to admit that for years, I wanted to have this kind of faith in the supernatural as well. But in so taking this exotic journey, have come to better understand myself in that I:\nAm a skeptical thinker and accept evolution, quantum physics and other science-based descriptions of our universe\nDespise hierarchy, such as those found in student/teacher relationships or in mideavil feudalistic societies and the religious which came from them\nFiercely value individuality, which contrasts with Eastern collectivism\nDo not enjoy being manipulated by “secret” teachings withheld only for the chosen few\nEnjoy debate and banter where I or my conversation partner are willing to change their mind if persuaded\nValue self-improvement and the freedom to change ones mind when evidence suggests a prior belief or attitude is no longer beneficial \nThink everyone should have the opportunity to improve their lot in life\n\nAll of these values conflict with the cult-like experiences I’ve moved away from in religious life and have found a bit of a vacuum. Sam Harris’s non-dual meditation has helped me find stillness. And Stoicism has helped me find non-dogmatic instructions for dealing with life’s challenges. I do not think morality comes from religion, and in fact, have found myself much more kind and compassionate as an atheist. \n\nIn How to Think Like a Roman Emperor, Robertson describes Marcus Aurelius’s various mentors and how their relationships unfolded, not unlike Xeno and his followers many centuries before. Where the students of Stoicism were encouraged to debate and even contradict their teachers. Where outside influences were welcomed as long as they worked, for example, the adoption of the Golden Verses of Pythagoras, a completely rivaled school.  Marcus expresses frustration with his closest friend and Stoic mentor, the physician Galen, who as both teacher and friend, challenged the emperor to be a better person. \n\nMentorship, to me, surpasses the traditional student/teacher relationship for many reasons. It is founded in mutual respect and friendship. It lacks an unhealthy power dynamic allowing the mentee to make up their own mind. It provides both parties with an opportunity to grow. Based on this, I’m excited to apply to the College of Stoic Philosophers and to appeal to your admissions committee on my acceptance, as I would take such an opportunity quite seriously and with much gratitude. \n', 1, '2020-04-15', 0, 0, 0, '', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', 0, 0, '', ''),

How long you have been interested in Stoicism.\n\nI have had an on and off interest in Stoicism since I first heard of it in secondary school. However, back then, I did not know that there were modern-day Stoics. I discovered New Stoa a few years ago and since then the idea of deepening my understanding of Stoicism has been on my mind. Stoicism with its emphasis on character building and personal ethics befits my own preferences. I can also relate to the pantheistic concept of the Divine, even though I have a rather agnostic attitude. \n\nMy recently re-ignited interest in Stoicism is probably due to a number personal factors, especially my age and the fact that we are expecting our first child. Hence, I have to consider what kind of education I can offer to my son. Dogmatic religions (such as traditional Christianity) that focus on the supernatural, miracles and the afterlife are basically meaningless today (at least for me), while possible Eastern alternatives, such as Japanese Zen, are too obscure and culturally alien for most Westerners. Secular Humanism is just too amorphous, and does not offer a coherent worldview or applicable ethical standards. I have reached the conclusion that Stoicism is the best option for me personally, and it is something that I would pass on to my children in order to give them a compass in life, so that they can be decent human beings without the need to believe in outdated religious dogmas.\n\nDepending on how much spare time I have got, I try to follow the activities of The Stoic Fellowship, New Stoa, Stoicon and other similar organizations. I also belong to several Facebook discussion groups about Stoic philosophy, and I often read the messages, even if normally I don\'t take an active role. In Hungary, I am one of the organizers of the Marcus Aurelius Free University, an adult education iniciative that was launched earlier this year to promote Stoicism and practical philosophy. Given my interest in the Spanish language and Hispanic culture, I am also on the mailing list of Madrid Stoa.\n\n2. Any books you read on Stoic philosophy.

Would you call yourself an atheist, agnostic/skeptic, deist, theist? \n\nI woud call myself an agnostic or skeptic.\n\n4. Have you studied philosophies other than Stoicism? If so, which?\n\nI hold a Master\'s degree in Philosophy and Ethics and I am also a qualified secondary school teacher of Philosophy and Democratic Values, even tough I have never worked as a school teacher. However, unfortunately, my Master\'s programme followed a rather post-modern agenda, it was very theoretical and over-ideologized. The Stoics and other major ancient philospophical schools were just a box to tick at the beginning of the curriculum, before quickly jumping to Deconstructionism, Feminism, Gender Studies and similar theories.\n\nTo a certain degree, I am familiar with Platonism, Aristotelianism, Epicureanism, German Idealism, American Transcendentalism, Existentialism, Japanese Zen.\n\nI also have an interest in Japanese Morita Therapy, which is quite similar to, although probably less sophisticated than Stoicism.\n\n5. Are you a member of a religious faith? If so, which and for how long?\n\nI was raised Roman Catholic and went to a boarding school run by Benedictine monks, however, at the age of 18, I left Catholicism and joined the Hungarian Unitarian Church. I have never officially left the Unitarians, but have not been actively involved with them for more than a decade. My main problem with Hungarian-Transylvanian Unitarianism is that it\'s too traditionally theistic and biblical, whereas I find Anglo-Saxon Unitarian Universalism over-politicized, where social and political conservatives, like myself, just do not feel comfortable. \n\n6. Do you consider yourself to be a Stoic? \n\nYes, I probably do, although I am a somewhat skeptical and conservative kind of Stoic. My conservative instincts lead me to appreciate spontaneous and organically developed human institutions and to be cautious with theoretical reasoning in detriment of empiricism. At the same time, while I accept the virtue ethics of Stoicism, I cannot completely disregard utilitarian considerations, as I believe that virtuous and well-meaning people sometimes may wreak havoc, and seemingly egotistic instentions may lead to a postive outcome and may benefit other people (i.e. free market).\n\n7. What you want to get from this course. \n\nTo be honest, I do not know what to expect. I am fairly familiar with the ethical aspects of Stoicism, but my understanding of Stoic logic and physics is rather superficial. Perhaps, I want to receive a more structured and well-rounded training.', 1, '2020-04-15', 0, 0, 0, '', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', 0, 0, '', '');

Know Thyself!? WTF? Is it even possible to fully realize the fruits of such a monumental undertaking? How does one truly begin that arduous journey? What path do we take? What course shall we set our compass for? Does it begin with goodness and naivety? Does it manifest through belief, faith, obedience, dogma, and religion? Or do we follow a path of treachery and deceit? Will it be the path of wine, women, and song? Or “whoever dies with the most toys wins”? Shall it be found through the vanquishing of those degenerates who would bring society down to their level of depravity? Will it be brought about through the destruction of heretics, infidels, and non-believers, by systems of hierarchy... be it through democracy, philosopher-kings or tin-pot despots? Shall we know ourselves by bending the world and others to our will and dominating them? Or by cowing down, and submitting ourselves to the authorities? As for me... I\'m setting my personal moral compass for the headings of truth, honesty, integrity, virtue, courage, prudence, justice, and wisdom, freedom, and equality.\n\nI was born and raised in Kansas City, Missouri. I am the oldest of six children, and was raised as a Protestant Christian. My father was employed as a toolmaker/machinist for a local federal contractor. My mother was a stay-at-home mom. Neither of them had a college education. My mom loved her kids. She did her very best to take good care of us. My dad was a brutal dictator. I loved my mom and I hated my dad.\n\nI have issues. Big issues. I started out life on the wrong side of the bed. I didn\'t belong. I didn\'t belong anywhere. Not at home... not at school. My father seemed disappointed in me from the very beginning. I wasn\'t good enough for him. I threw the ball “like a girl”. I was always in trouble. In trouble at home, and in trouble at school. My father told me that if I got picked on by someone, that I had better fight, win or lose... because if I didn\'t... I was getting an ass-whooping when he found out about it. He physically and emotionally brutalized and abused his wife and children. It sucked... and I hated it. I wanted out... and I couldn\'t get away soon enough. I was determined to escape any way I could manage. In the meantime, I thought I\'d found heaven when I started smoking pot and dropping LSD with my friends at sixteen years of age. At the time, I thought I was the only one in my group of friends who came from a dysfunctional family. Ha!\n\nNeedless to say, my father took a dim view of my friends and our recreational activities. By the time I was seventeen years old I found myself kicked out of the house and fending completely for myself. Free at last! I had a restaurant job busing tables and washing dishes. I lied about my age and got my own place in a sleazy apartment building not far from where I worked. Of course, my apartment became the designated “party hut” for drinking and drugging. I fell behind in school, stopped going to class, and was eventually expelled my Junior year. I had brushes with the law, but somehow managed to evade any serious legal consequences. I finally realized that I was on a dead-end path. \n\nIn early 1974 I joined the Job Corps to get a GED and learn a trade. I was sent to the Weber Basin Job Corps Center just outside Ogden, Utah for my training. I earned my GED diploma soon after arriving there and began learning brick and block masonry in earnest. I quickly became the “foreman” of the trainee brick crew. It was a good experience for me. I was very proficient at that work and I liked being a brick mason. The freedom and independence which comes with being a construction worker appealed to me, but I decided I didn\'t want to do it for the rest of my life. I wanted a career using my head more than my hands.\n\nThe local US Navy recruiter showed up one day and administered a battery of tests to those of us who had an interest in joining the Navy. I scored very well on the tests, and decided to enlist in the Navy and become an Electronics Technician as soon as I completed my Job Corps training. By late 1974 I had completed my course of study and graduated from the Job Corps with my certification as a qualified brick mason.\n\nI entered the Navy in January 1975.  I completed training as an Electronics Technician and was  assigned to a ship home-ported in San Diego. I did not like life in the Navy and opted for an honorable early discharge in July 1976. \n\nI stayed in San Diego and continued my “party-hearty” ways there. I worked at a pizza parlor and enrolled in community college to study electronics further. In 1977 I obtained employment doing electronics work for General Dynamics while continuing my studies at community college. \n\nIn the late spring of 1978 I was involved in an uninsured automobile accident in Ensenada, Mexico, and went to jail for nine days. Unfortunately, I was supposed to be testing for finals at school during the time I was incarcerated in Mexico, and I missed my final exams. Consequently, I was not able to graduate with the AA degree in Electronic which I had worked so hard to complete. \n\nI married my first wife in 1979. In November 1980 I quit my job at General Dynamics and took a job with the federal government working as a Federal Civil Servant working as a metrologist in the Navy Calibration Laboratory at North Island Naval Air Station, San Diego, CA. Our daughter, my only child, was born in December 1980. I wasn\'t ready to quit partying, settle down, and do the family thing. The marriage was a train wreck and it failed. We separated permanently in 1982.\n\nIn 1984, I discovered Tibetan Vajrayana Tantric Buddhism and went for it hook, line, and sinker. I had no idea what I was really getting myself into when I chose to go down that path. I became a student of the infamous Chogyam Trungpa, Rinpoche. His drinking and debauchery is legendary. In the spring of 1986 I completed an AA degree in Selected Studies at San Diego Mesa Community College. Immediately after completing my AA degree I attended the last seminary at which Trungpa taught and was initiated into Tantric Buddhist practice at that time. Trungpa  died as a direct result of his drinking in April 1987.\n\nI married again in 1989, and shortly thereafter took a position working as an Electronics Technician at  the US Navy Calibration Laboratory, Cubi Point, Philippines. I was there when the volcanic eruption of Mount Pinatubo occurred. Due to my “indiscretion” while there.... my second marriage failed. Because the United States was abandoning it\'s military bases in the Philippines I was forced to return to my previous job at the Calibration Laboratory in San Diego in 1991.\n\nIn 1992, I married a third time. By 1994 I was divorced again. I hadn\'t yet woken up to the fact that maybe my drinking and drugging were causing problems in my life. Eventually, my pot smoking got me into trouble at work and I was forced to go to rehab for the first time. I was also required to submit to regular random drug testing for a year following rehab. I had to quit smoking weed if I wanted to keep my career and my retirement. Once that happened I pretty much became a full-blown alcoholic. I only drank beer, but I was an alcoholic nevertheless. I was still involved with the Trungpa Tantric Buddhist group. A deceased alcoholic guru... and his alcoholic student.\n\nI finally made it to the finish line and retired from federal service in November 2010 at 55 years of age. As soon as I was turned loose from the workplace I smoked and drank myself into oblivion for months. I was still involved with the Buddhist thing, but I was tiring of all the lies and bad behavior of people in the organization. Imagine that... me... getting tired of all the bad behavior of others! Ha!\n\nIn 2012, I met a very nice wholesome woman when she came to sit at my Buddhist meditation group. She does not drink or drug. In spite of my personal problems he saw goodness in me and a relationship developed between us. I wanted the relationship to work. For what seems like a very long time I went back and forth, and up and down, and around and around, trying to get my head on straight. I was so very unhappy riding the roller coaster of addiction. I knew things had to change with me if the relationship was to flourish and I was to find serenity and happiness in my life. Partying had been a lot of fun for a long time, but now it was consuming me piece by piece. It just wasn\'t working for me anymore like it once had. The continuous party which had gone on in my life for thirty years was finally entering it\'s long twilight phase. In 2013, I stopped drinking, went back to rehab, got into counseling, and started going to AA meetings again. \n\nIn 2014, I finally left the Trungpa Buddhist group once and for all. I had had enough of the meanness and competition, the perpetual maneuvering for position, the “good ol\' boy” system... and the lies, the pretense, the secrets, the arrogance, and the exploitation.  The organization always had it\'s hand out asking for more money. There was continual talk about “basic goodness”, “self-existing wisdom and compassion”, and “skillful means”... but I had witnessed and experienced little of it in the many years I had endured all the hypocrisy. I was no angel myself, but I knew bullshit was bullshit.\n\nI continued to not drink, but still smoked pot off and on. One day, a Catholic man I knew in the rooms of AA... someone I respected and admired... a man whom I considered to be genuine and authentic in whom he presented himself to be... and who had been sober for years... gave me a sheet of paper about the Stoic philosopher Epictetus and how little control we have over most things in life. The point being that drug addicts and alcoholics are self-centered control freaks, in the extreme, who must have things their own way. I was impressed by what it said. And, somehow, it stuck with me. The impact of that introduction to Stoicism did not take hold of me immediately, but it definitely stayed with me. It parked itself in the back of my mind somewhere.\n\nBy the end of summer, 2015, I knew intuitively that I had to get away from San Diego. I just had to get the fuck out of there. I was so sick of it and all the baggage that it held for me. I had never set foot in New Mexico, but I somehow knew it was the place I needed to be. So I rented a U-Haul truck and a trailer, loaded up my stuff, and towed my pick-up truck straight to Santa Fe, New Mexico, arriving at the end of October 2015.\n\nMy girlfriend, who was still in San Diego, flew out to visit me a couple of times shortly after I got to Santa Fe. I asked her to marry me on her second visit, and we tied the knot in February 2016. She went back to San Diego and started her retirement process. In May I flew back and drove her U-Haul from San Diego out to  Santa Fe. We purchased a home in Santa Fe later that year... a first for both of us. I hadn\'t had a drink of alcohol since October of 2013, but I was still smoking weed. My wife hates it when I smoke pot, but she rarely said anything about it to me. I was still indulging in regular binges. \nSomehow, I just got fucking sick and tired of being sick and tired of the whole thing. At the end of October, 2017, I threw in the towel on it for the umpteenth time (quitting is easy... I\'ve done it a thousand times),and started going to AA meetings again. I have not smoked since that time. I haven\'t had a drink in six years and I haven\'t toked up for two years now.\n\nAfter having been involved with the Buddhist thing for more than three decades it was hard to just walk away and not suffer any after-effects and self-doubt about my decision. After relocating to Santa Fe I would periodically lapse back into trying to reconnect to a personal Tantric meditation practice without the group. It never worked for me again. I just couldn\'t do it any more. The life of it... the heart of it... had gone out of it for me. It was tough to admit to myself, and I struggled with it for a long while, but I was eventually able to be honest with my self and move past it. \n\nThe true end came in an unexpected way. In the spring of 2017 I discovered a book written by a former student of Trungpa. He was a man whom I had met a couple of years before he passed away unexpectedly while undergoing surgery. He was John Steinbeck III, the younger son of the famous author, John Steinbeck. His book is titled, “The Other Side of Eden”. I got that book and read it. I had revered Chogyam Trungpa as a god for thirty years. This book finally tore that notion to shreds once and for all. By the time I came to be his student in 1984, Trungpa had destroyed his liver and developed a “wet brain” because of his drinking. His death, at age 46, was related directly to his alcoholic drinking. The book also alleges that he had a secret $30,000 a year cocaine habit as well. By the time I finished reading that book a new door had opened for me and an old one had slammed shut. Immediately after reading that book I gathered all photos of Trungpa and his successor (his son, of course. after all... it\'s a family business), and burned them. I also destroyed most of the practice texts and books I had collected over the years. No more rituals and magical thinking for me.\n\nJust prior to the epiphany that book brought to me, I had been begun my own personal self-study of Stoicism. Epictetus had stuck with me the entire time since I had first been introduced to him by my AA friend. Now the seed which he had planted was taking root and steadily growing within me. I was still in need of a healthy practical framework with which to set the heading of my moral compass and develop virtue and good character. After all, that\'s exactly what I had been seeking to find when I had hooked up with Trungpa. Since having rejected Trungpa I had become adamant about not falling under the spell of any religiosity ever again. No more hocus-pocus mumbo -jumbo. I knew that I needed real ground to walk on... not pie in the sky. I now lean toward being a secular agnostic humanist of sorts... with strong Stoic underpinnings. Or maybe a Stoic... with strong secular agnostic humanist underpinnings. Whichever is the case, I now consider myself to be a serious student of Stoicism... but I hesitate to call myself a Stoic outright. I suppose when it comes right down to it... I am a Stoic... but I\'m not proclaiming it very loudly. I sometimes mention it when talking with close friends, but talk is cheap. Like Marcus Aurelius said, “don\'t talk about doing the right thing... just do it”. Yeah, don\'t talk the walk... walk the walk, baby... walk the walk, as best one can. We all have a long journey ahead of us. I suppose part of my reluctance to make loud claims of being a Stoic comes from knowing that the Christian church has appropriated a lot of Stoic context for it\'s own use. I especially detest Christianity. I don\'t want to be confused with that mess in any way, shape, or form. Read Bertrand Russell\'s, “Why I\'m Not A Christian”.\n\nI have read quite a bit of Pierre Hadot. I discovered him because of my interest in Neo-Platonism. I was intrigued when I read that Hadot started out writing about Neo-Platonism, but transitioned to writing about Stoicism (and Epicureanism) because he thought it a more practical system for finding happiness. Once I read that, I immediately got hooked into learning more about Stoicism. \n\nOne of the most important questions which Hadot answered for me is that traditional Stoicism was a kind of deterministic, teleological, philosophy. It has metaphysical, “god-like”, elements such as “providence”, “fate”, “purpose”, and the like. I don\'t want that. I don\'t need that. I see religion and religiosity... and all the dogma which always emerges from it, as damaging. Damaging to people and damaging to society. I do not deny the existence of a god... but I will go so far as to say that I doubt that there is a personal god who intervenes in our lives. Perhaps there is something akin to a ”god”, but there is no proof, and we can not know for certain one way or the other. To affirm or to deny is merely speculation. I\'m not a theist nor am I an atheist. I have no wish to play that game. It\'s a waste of time. I did my time in the bag of mystical-shmystical bullshit. In the end, there\'s nothing substantial to take to the spiritual bank. All that stuff just opens the door to being tricked, abused, and exploited. Usually... asking for easy answers seems to result in paying a huge personal cost. No more for me, thank you. \n\nFor my entire life I have had an interest in all things mystical and metaphysical... Neo-Platonism, the Freemasons, tarot, the Hermetic Tradition, alchemy, kabbalah, sacred geometry, all that stuff. I even tried to join the Freemasons in 2014, so I could study their esoteric teachings, but they wouldn\'t have me. That\'s okay... I\'ve decided I don\'t want to be a member of the New World Order anyway.\n\nWe all want answers... but at what price? Is doing the virtuous thing reward enough in and of itself? Does it lead to “flourishing”? Is that an easy enough answer? I think so. Sometimes, if necessary, going the long way is the best way, the most expedient way, the most efficient way... the shortest, easiest, surest way. That is merely my own personal opinion, of course. But that is the base I choose to operate from now. Doing the right thing is probably the most valuable lesson which I have gleaned from my personal study of Stoicism thus far.  \n\nSo many people... and I am among them... want easy answers. That\'s why there\'s religion. That\'s why there\'s always a “boss”. That\'s why there\'s a belief in God. That\'s why Marx called religion “the opium of the masses”. But most of that stuff just doesn\'t pay off. I mean... when it comes right down to it... who are you people?... the College of Stoic Philosophy? Are you genuinely striving toward virtue and good character? I think so. But... you could be used-car sales-people in philosopher\'s robes. I have looked at all your photos and read all your biopic stories. A policeman? Scholarch? Really? Why? Who said so? \n\nI am inclined to trust you people... or I wouldn\'t be taking the time to write my intimate personal story and send it to you... trusting that it is in good hands. But... I did the same thing when I hooked up with Trungpa. My intent here is not to offend you or piss you off. Sometimes it pays to be skeptical and to ask questions. I mean... true philosophers ask the hard questions... don\'t they? That\'s their job! I\'ve learned my lessons the hard way. I have a long history of learning the hard way. But, here I am... telling my intimate life story to people I do not know. People whom I haven\'t ever had any contact with prior to now. Whose hands will my intimate personal story end up in? What will they do with it? Who else will know? \n\nI first found the Traditional Stoicism website, and the link, which is there, to the College of Stoic Philosophers, at least a year ago. I looked it over carefully, but in the end, I said no-go. Who are these people? \n\nI even see that you you have your own metaphysical/mystical order... or whatever it is... the Fourth School... the Black Eagle Monastery. Wow! That\'s pretty cool. At least, that\'s what the gullible, trusting, adventuresome Craig thinks. Actually... am I interested in the Fourth School? Oh, I am. But... am I wary? Absolutely. You bet I am. \n\nI showed my fantastic, wonderful, wife your website and asked her what she thinks. I asked her if I should take the plunge and go for it. She says I should go for it. She sees how much my self-study of Stoicism has helped me get my head on straighter. She even got her own Stoic workbook for herself after seeing what it has done for me. Stoicism has substance. It\'s good stuff. It is down-to-earth goodness, right there for the taking. It\'s not “pie in the sky when you die” stuff. (I was most pleased to learn that Cognitive Behavioral Therapy has roots in the Stoic tradition.) As a good socialist/anarchist/communist I don\'t want pie in the sky pie in the sky when I die. As a good anti-Capitalist and anti-fascist... I don\'t want pie in the sky when I die. As a Stoic practitioner, I don\'t want  pie in the sky when I die. As a leftist... and as a student of Stoicism... I value honesty, integrity, virtue, courage, wisdom, prudence, and virtue. I value democracy, social justice, freedom, and equality. I\'ve had enough of smash and grab politics and advertising... and the so-called “free-market” of neo-liberal capitalism.\n\nI think it important to say a few words about the relationship between Stoicism and Alcoholics Anonymous. Of course, the well-known “Serenity Prayer” is derived from Stoicism. Once you make the connection, it\'s plain as day. It\'s about accepting that some things are beyond one\'s control, having the wisdom to discern what is and what is not within one\'s control, having the courage to change what is under our control, and the serenity that comes from being able to do so. Acceptance, control, courage, wisdom, and serenity are all key Stoic concepts.\n\nAA has a lot of really good equipment in it\'s toolbox for those who come seeking help. But there are also some aspects of what they teach that just doesn\'t set well with me as a Stoic. \n\nFirst off, some of the good stuff...\n\nAA teaches that our “ego is not our amigo”, and that we are most often characterized as being  defiant and self-centered in the extreme.  AA teaches that there are certain “flash points”, i.e. sex, money, livelihood, hubris, etc., that when encroached upon, can cause resentments to arise, and that we must learn to deal with our resentments in a way which is different and more healthy than we have in the past... or we will drink/drug again.\n\n Part of the way in which we are taught to deal with our resentments is to make proper amends to those whom we have harmed in the past, and to those whom we harm in the future.  That we need to look carefully at what role, we ourselves, have played in a situation that has gone bad, rather than focusing solely on how we have been wronged. They teach that it is absolutely essential that we be honest with ourselves and others because honesty is the cornerstone of sobriety. And they teach that we must understand that our need to control, and the inevitable frustration which will result when we fail to control people, places, and things to our satisfaction will cause resentments, and therefore we might relapse in addiction. So, this is the point at which Stoic teachings about how very little control we actually have over anything other than our desires, our actions, and what we give our assent to, come into play. In this sense, there is a direct correlation between the teachings of AA and the teachings of Stoicism... and both of those schools of teachings have a direct correlation with how Craig Bledsoe, the alcoholic drug addict, deals with his world.\n\nNow, for the not so good stuff... \n\nOh, yes... there is a chapter in the Big Book of Alcoholics Anonymous which is addressed “To the Agnostic”. That would be me, and other people like me, of course. It makes a number of rather poor, and not very convincing arguments about why we should embrace a “higher power”. The higher power could be the recovery group you belong to... they make great pains to make it clear that we are free to choose our higher power, whatever that may be. I mean... it could be a *chair*, for that matter. Yeah, that\'s great, but it doesn\'t work for me. And let\'s face it, when it comes right down to it, what they really want is for you to embrace God. “Let go, and let god”. It\'s not very scientific. Yes, it works great for some folks... but not everyone. I\'m one of the “not everyone” folks. I\'m an agnostic. So, what do I do? \n\nOne of the biggest issues I have with AA is that they strongly discourage you from trusting yourself. What they say is that “your best thinking is what got you here” (therefore, you need a higher power).  Yeah, okay... I get it. But I don\'t like that answer. I mean... if I weren\'t careful... I could get a resentment about it. :)  Not trusting one\'s self does not fall in line the the teachings of Stoicism and our capacity as human beings to reason. Science has shown that our brains are plastic. If we encourage good habits by practicing them, then our brain will naturally follow that neurological pathway more and more. It works the same way with bad habits... like the habituated patterns of an alcoholic drug addict. So, yeah... AA teaches you to develop some sense of reason and good habits... and the plasticity of our brain will take it from there... but there\'s just too damn much God stuff and innuendo to suit me.\n\nOf the seven questions that are to be answered in this essay I believe (and correct me if I am wrong) I have already adequately addressed questions (and sub-questions) 1, 3, 4, 5, and 6. That leaves questions 2 and 7 for me to answer.\n\nThus far I have read: \n\n“How To Be A Stoic” by Massimo Pigliucci\n\n“Philosophy as a Way of Life” by Pierre Hadot\n\n“The Enchiridian: The Good Life Handbook”      a translation offered by Dr Chuck Chakrapai\n\n“A Fortunate Storm: The Improbable Story of Stoicism”     by Dr Chuck Chakrapani\n\n(I actually have purchased the entire set of books offered by Chuck Chakrapani, but I have yet to read them. I really like some of his work but sometimes I\'m not so enthusiastic about it.)\n\n\nI am currently in the process of reading:\n\n“Meditations”   by Marcus Aurelius (the Gregory Hays translation)\n\n“A New Stoicism”  by Lawrence C Becker\n\n“The Inner Citadel: The Meditations of Marcus Aurelius”   by Pierre Hadot\n\n“The Obstacle is the Way”  by Ryan Holiday ( I subscribe to his Daily Stoic email blasts)\n\n\nI have the following books in my “to read” stack:\n\nthe Dover Thrift Edition of “Seneca\'s Letters From A Stoic”\n\n“Epictetus Discourses” Books 1-4   translated by Oldfather from the Loeb Classic Library\n\n“What Is Ancient Philosophy” by Pierre Hadot\n\n“The History of Western Philosophy” by Bertrand Russell\n\nI have not yet read any of the stuff by Donald Robertson, but I did participate one year in the online Stoicon week. I tried watching some of his videos on youtube but found it too difficult to understand what he was saying because of his Scottish accent.  \n\nI have read extensively, in various places online, about Stoicism. I am familiar with the websites: The Stoic Gym, Modern Stoicism, Daily Stoic, and Massimo Pigliucci\'s blogs... Figs In Winter, How To Be A Stoic, etc\n\nNow for the final question...  “What Do I Want From This Course?”\n\nI want to develop the best personal character I possibly can, and I view your courses as a potential path to that end. I suppose I don\'t have any other real solid etched-in-stone answers other than that. Obviously, I want to learn how to further hone my skills as a practitioner of Stoicism. It\'s an on-going lifelong journey. As Massimo would say “Stoic but not a sage”. Any additional tools I can put into my tool kit are valuable. As much as anything I hope to learn about Stoicism, I fancy the notion of being in contact and working with other persons who seriously value Stoic philosophy as a way of life (plus... I am starved for Stoic companionship and interaction here in Santa Fe, New Mexico). I would like to think that what you offer is a structured framework which I could use as a springboard to move ahead with making Stoic practice a way of life for me. I yearn to further develop and exercise the plastic neural pathways of my brain on my journey of making daily Stoic practice a part of my living breathing being. \n\nIf I like my experience with the College of Stoic Philosophy, while taking the School of Essential Studies course, I already have the notion of going onto the Marcus Aurelius School, as well. If those two endeavors go well, and are successful, I am also very curious about  exploring the possibility of the Fourth School if that option should be made available to me. \n\nThank you for providing the opportunity to connect with your community. Thank you for taking the time to slog through my life story as submitted here. \n\nI hope to hear from you soon.

In this essay, I  abbreviate 56 years of my personal and professional life, providing the reader with a sense of my upbringing, those experiences I consider important, and how I  became interested in Stoicism.  I  weave into my narrative the answers to those questions The College specifically asks all candidates to address.\n\n	I was born in January 1963, the middle child (and only son) with four sisters, to Jane and Arthur White.  I grew up in a middle-class, mostly white neighborhood in the Maryland suburbs of Washington, D.C.  My father was a civil servant as an engineer working for NASA, which he did for over 45 years.  My mother was a stay-at-home mom for most of my childhood, but went into the retail workforce as we children grew older.  We lived in a loving home and were well cared for, and had all that we needed, but not all that we wanted.  My parents we’re  always frugal, but did not skimp on meal preparation.  We had traditional meals around the table as a family growing up, followed by TV time together.  I enjoyed the attention and a special relationship with both my father and mother as an only son.  It was especially special between my father and I all the way to his death in 2018.    \n\n	My sisters and I all attended private Catholic grade school.  Our family went to Mass every week, and I was a very active altar boy.   While I played all the organized sports at least once growing up, I had a dislike for all of them except baseball.  I played sports because it was what all boys did, but I didn\'t enjoy them.  However, I did enjoy the informality and competition in pickup games of kickball in the street,  keep-away in the school parking lot, and touch football in the park. Those days in the 1970\'s were spent mostly out of doors with friends.   I was an above average student in grade school earning mostly A’s and B’s, but I certainly didn’t have to study too hard.  I was active in school activities like drama club, cub scouts, Civil Air Patrol and Webelos.   \n\n     As I got into high school, my grades declined somewhat as my interest in school waned, and things of the real world captivated me. I started working as a restaurant busboy at the age of 13 and have been in the workforce ever since.  It was in high school, I developed an interest in aviation.  My uncle was a WWII bomber pilot and my father an Air Force (AF) aviation officer-mechanic.  Eventually I earned my private pilot’s license at the age of 18.  Also during those high school years, I bought my first motorcycle, photography became an interest, I joined the local fire department as a firefighter/EMT, and met my first and only love of my life (my wife Cheri) as a volunteer at our local hospital.  They were formative years which would mold my interests into the future.\n\n     I was accepted into the University of Maryland, and began studies as a Law Enforcement major.  I commuted to school everyday, and did well at subjects that interested me, and persevered through those that did not.  I joined AFROTC with aspirations of becoming a pilot, and eventually was selected to go to pilot school.  During my college years, AFROTC became my passion and motivation for getting through school.  I enjoyed it immensely, especially the opportunity to learn about leadership and apply those principles in a controlled environment as I was promoted  through the ranks over the four years.  My relationship with my high school girlfriend grew and became serious.  It was also during this time I had my first deep look at my faith and my walk with God.  I was fortunate enough to be working at a photography store and became the manager.  My father was an alcoholic by this time, so our relationship was only mediocre. The owner of the store became a mentor to me, and taught me about business and the value of professionalism and using ones strengths in the workplace.  I appreciated his belief in me, and he eventually offered me the opportunity to open a store of my own with him as a partner.  I declined the offer because my sights were set on the Air Force as a career.    In summary,  my college years were busy, fulfilling  and exciting with high hopes for a bright future and confidence in myself.\n\n     As a junior in college, my then-girlfriend of 5 years became my fiance’.  We decided to marry upon graduation in two years.  For those two years, Cheri had to decide if she really wanted to give up her career aspirations be a military wife and be transplanted every few years with new assignments.  She decided to give-up a promising career in banking to spend her life with me.  Upon graduation in 1985, I was commissioned an officer, we married after seven years of dating, and then 6 months later went to flight school.  They were exciting but difficult times together, especially the first 2 years.  Flight school was my first real tough life test, and potential life failing.  I persevered and successfully completed flight school.  My father became sober and both my parents were there as my wife pinned on my wings.\n\n     My assignments in the AF were extraordinary to me, as I not only had many fascinating jobs and experiences, but I was able to learn about how the rest of the country and world experienced life.  It was so different than my upbringing.  For this east coast city-boy, it was eye-opening  to meet and see the lifestyle of farmers in the likes of rural North Dakota towns.  You could carry on a conversation with someone in the grocery store line as though you had known them for life.  That was so different. My AF assignments were exciting and included among others:\n\n     Supporting intercontinental ballistic missile sites on the Northern Tier\n     Search and rescues off the sides of mountains,\n     Traveling with the White House to over 42 countries as an Air Force One advance agent\n     Providing airlift for Cabinet Secretaries and senior government officials\n     Directing combat  search and rescue operations over Iraq\n     Deep involvement in response activities on 9/11\n\n     Most importantly, these experiences grew me as a leader.  I understood that to become a better leader for others, it needed to start with leading my own life with intention.  In the mid-1990’s, I started on a journey focused on becoming the best “version” of myself.   Self discipline, personal development, goal setting and education became important to me.  I finally finished my Master’s of Science degree in Space Studies after seven years, and studied the books of Stephen Covey, Napoleon Hill, Zig Ziglar, Jim Rohn and others.  Although I never studied philosophy, it was during that time I came to appreciate some of the concepts I now know are shared with Stoic philosophy and my christian faith, which I continue to practice to this day.  The net effect of this on my life was to become more introspective, examine my own life, and live more intentionally.  \n\n     Over the years, my wife and I had four girls.    In 1998 my resolve and resilience was tested in the middle of a very challenging military command assignment.  We lost our youngest daughter to SIDS death, which was devastating to us both.  To this day, it is a common life changing experience my whole family shares bonding us closer than we could have ever imagined. There was much to learn in retrospect.  As a therapeutic measure, I decided to build a two-seat experimental aircraft that I flew for years.   The completion of that plane in itself, taught me many life important life lessons. Our family continues to be close, and I now have five grandchildren.  They all live nearby and we see them regularly and interact almost daily.  \n\n     In 2017, my sisters and I became responsible for the full time care of both of my parents, as they were in their mid-eighties with health issues rendering them unable to care for themselves.  We watched them both decline, and were present for both of their deaths in 2018.  They died within 6 months of each other.  Those many months with them in their decline offered ample opportunity to ponder about death. It was timely for my Stoic study.  My reflections on the Stoic view of death helped me tremendously to endure their passing.  I was sad, but not troubled.  My resilience was obvious to others, and I attribute it the Stoic viewpoint.   \n\n     I am currently a senior executive within the Sergeant at Arms organization at the U.S. Senate.  I enjoy greatly what I do, mostly because I believe that the work is important and serves a purpose greater than myself.  The people I am honored to serve with make it equally gratifying.  I have the honor of using the talents I’ve acquired over my professional career to help directly lead an organization of approximately 300 staff, where my leadership skills are called upon each day.  I am currently helping to coach and mentor my subordinates, with an eye on preparing myself to become a life coach in my post-retirement life.\n\n     I have had many interests over the years, and instead of mastering deeply only a couple of interests, I have chosen to be a “jack of all trades, and master of none.”  I enjoy the thrill, creativity and discovery of learning and exploring something new.   Over the years, my interests have included magic, brewing and wine making, cooking, running, cheese making, gardening, and others.  I recently retired from the fire service, but I continue to ride a touring motorcycle with my wife, practice with the guitar, pistol shoot, and am trying to learn spanish.  \n\n     A few years ago I began listening to podcasts which  introduced me, like many, to the resurgence in the interest of Stoicism. As I listened and learned of its precepts, it resonated with me, because I realized I had already been trying to live in accordance with some of the Stoic principles.  It fascinated me further,  and over the past couple of years, I have been doing personal study.  I subscribe to the Stoic Gym Magazine and have read some of Chuck Chakrapani’s short e-books.  I am particularly  impressed by the work done by Eric Fisher on his podcast Stoicism on Fire, and his emphasis on the Divine component of Stoicism.   I find it noteworthy that he wants to ensure any  modernized version of stoicism which accepts an atheistic/agnostic worldview is distinctly differentiated from its historical roots.  In my reading, I have completed the  following books:\n\n     The Obstacle is the Way (Holiday)\n     On the shortness of Life\n     The Enchiridion\n     How to Think Like a Roman Emperor (Robertson)\n     The Moral Letters of Seneca\n     How to be Free (Long)\n     Stoicism (Sellars)\n\n     The next book on my reading list is the Inner Citadel by Hadot.\n\n     While I don’t consider myself a Stoic, I do consider myself a student of Stoicism, a Prokopton traveling along the  Stoic path. To me, the logic of Stoic philosophy makes sense.  So far, I believe it to be consistent with my faith, which is of utmost importance to me.   My study of Stoicism thus far has provided me with a fundamental understanding of the basics of the philosophy.  I am interested in going deeper on those elements, fully appreciating how they blend together to produce a Stoic life.  More importantly, I want to learn how to better integrate Stoic practices into my daily life.  \n', 1, '2020-06-07', 0, 0, 0, '', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', 0, 0, '', ''),

I am a Catholic Hispanic American and believe that God is present in us an in all things, and He has our best interest in mind.  However, I don’t know if this belief ever helped me deal with the setbacks and frustrations of the everyday.  For me, it all began with my 40th birthday and the birth of my first daughter.  I was tired, distracted, out of shape, and overall disillusioned with my career.  You would think that a physician dedicated to caring for people would find work rewarding, and in many ways it was.  Yet, there was something missing.  Instead, I found myself frustrated by whiny patients, flustered by the recognition of other physicians over me, and floundering in mounds of over-burdensome regulations by insurances and government agencies.\n\nAfter Emmy was born, I found myself asking, “Is this it?  Is this the healthiest I am ever going to be?  Is this the most energy I am ever going to have?  Is this the best person I will ever be?  And is this enough for her?  My whole life had been marked by achievement of the next step: getting into college, getting into medical school, getting into residency and fellowship.  Papers, research, volunteering, and exams; then, the right job, the right wife, the right house.  Each step was one step closer to that dream of getting somewhere in life, of being someone.  To use, David Brooks’ terminology, I only ever saw the need for the resumé virtues, and did not even think of the eulogy virtues.  Now, my only wish was to be the best father and husband I could be.  It was so foreign to shift from defining success not by what I achieved but by who I was.  To move from ‘doing’ to ‘being.’  Cecily was born two years later and I was only more committed to being a more complete person and father.\n\nInitially, I thought I could be everything to everyone if only I could be more efficient with my time.  I got up earlier.  I started working out in order to have more energy to be with the family.  I started reading books on parenting, time management, and personal development.  I developed a fairly robust mindfulness meditation practice.  I found a new joy in podcasts, audiobooks and in reading.\n\nThen, I found Brian Johnson and joined his Optimize website.  I also found Ryan Holiday and read his 3 core books: Ego is the Enemy, The Obstacle is the Way, and Stillness is the Key.  Through their works, I was introduced to Stoicism.  I read How to Be a Stoic by Massimo Pigliucci, A Guide to the Good Life by William B. Irvine, and How to Think Like a Roman Emperor by Donald Robertson.  I also read Nils Salzgeber’s Little Book of Stoicism.  I took several of Donald Robertson’s online courses as well.  Most recently, I finished Dr. Gregory Sadler’s free online course on The Enchiridion.\n\nI listened to several podcasts on Stoicism including The Practicing Stoic and the Sunday Stoic but by far the one that was most educational and most authentic was David Fisher’s Stoicism on Fire.  I listed to all of the episodes and tried to incorporate them into my life with modest success.  I found that more than almost any of my other endeavors, Stoicism was the most logical, and when practiced, led to the most immediate positive results.  This podcast led me to The College of Stoic Philosophers.\n\nThrough these podcasts, books, and newsletters, I was introduced to several Stoic practices like memento mori, cosmic view from above, and premeditatio malorum.  I also try, as much as possible, to remember amor fati. The one practice, though, that seemed to be most helpful to me was contemplation of the sage.  I have a yearning to know what makes a good person, what those qualities are, and how can I can embody them in my life.  While not a Stoic text, I found David Brooks’ The Road to Character is helpful in this endeavor.  Like the Stoics, I believe that this is the way to ultimate fulfillment and tranquility.  I believe in integrity, honesty, resilience, humility, compassion, service.  I want to be the one who is sought after for advice because they know they will get the truth; to be the person that can always be asked because he can be counted on.  I imagine my optimized self to be 4 things in one, four things that represent the best mind, heart, body, and soul.  These are a healer/protector, a family man, an athlete, and a sage.\n\nCurrently, my morning ritual consists of 20 minutes of mindfulness meditation followed by Stoic meditations.  Then after reviewing my days schedule I will use premeditatio malorum and imagine what can go wrong.  I will often try to imagine what things are in my control and what things are not keeping in mind the common things that get me upset.  These usually will include running late, difficult patients, incompetency of nurses and assistants, and my children’s misbehaving.  Then, I read for 30 minutes or more before going to the gym.  Throughout the day, I try to use prosoche and be cognizant of my reactions to setbacks.  At night, I have been trying to journal about how well I have done at maintaining my equanimity, though admittedly I have often been too tired to write.\n\nFive years have passed, since my first was born and I my approach to life is very different.  I have all new goals and a whole new mindset.  While according to Epictetus, I am  not supposed to admit to being a philosopher and a Stoic, I do think that I am one though I think there is some humor and compassion that I have yet to find in my reading of Stoicism.  I still find myself getting impatient and angry at times.  I am sure that it is because I confuse what is truly good and what is a preferred indifferent.  Brittany Polat tries to impart this idea in Tranquility Parenting.  I can easily forget that my kids’ behaviors are ultimately not under my control.  Still, I am much better than before.  I no longer care about professional recognition but only that I do the best that I can do for that patient across from me at that moment.  I have far to go, but I want to be better: a better physician, a better husband, and a better father.  I recently This is what I would ultimately get out of the SES course.

I am not sure if I can reach the goal of mastering myself and I would like to at least reach the halfway mark before the end of my lifetime. Looking back on the path I have traveled so far, I am equally grateful for both the ups and downs in my life.  Especially for all the challenges which led me to learn about stoicism.\n\nDo I call myself an atheist, agnostic/skeptic, deist, theist? Am I a member of religious faith? If so, which and for how long? \nI am from the southern part of India and I was born in a family that worships a family god (maybe our ancestors) and several Hindu gods. I grew up in a small town, where there are several families from a different religious backgrounds. During my early childhood years, I had many Muslim friends. Since my parents enrolled me in a catholic boarding school, I had a chance to learn about Christianity all through my middle school and high school years. In those days I listened to Bible recitations at least 3 times a day for 7 years. Doctrines from different kinds of religious beliefs made me develop an understanding of common teachings. \n\nI always had the attitude of believing that things will work out. I continued to be a person that put my faith in Providence. I perceive whatever happens to me as good. I can say I picked up the principles from all the religious teaching that I concur with. Even though I do not actively practice any religion and/or follow any book as much as my other family members do, I do believe in God. \n\nAfter my marriage, I came to the United States when I was 21 years old. I am married for 23 years now and currently living with my husband and children in Des Plaines, Illinois. We have two children, a 17-year-old son, and a 12-year-old special-needs daughter.\n\nMy daughter was diagnosed with chromosomal abnormalities when she was 9-month-old. Her diagnosis left us devasted. Being far away from home, we had to deal with that situation by ourselves. Our friends have been very nice consoling us regarding my daughter. That was not enough at that time. No one could give me the answer I had hoped for. I wished for someone to hand me the manual about how to be a parent for a special-needs child.\n\nWhilst I was figuring out how to raise a special-needs child, feeling tired all the time, I saw myself losing my physical strength because of not getting enough sleep. I was worried about the unknown future at the expense of my present physical and mental health. I realized that my strength is more important to raise my daughter, so I diverted my attention to taking care of my health. I started running. Running helped me to burn the built-up energy created by negative thoughts.  So far, I ran a few 5k runs and a 10k run. \n\nBy choosing to learn about something new, I stopped worrying. Instead, I was doing whatever needs to be done to make her stronger and healthier. Day by day we learned how to take care of her and now, she has become a healthy child and she started walking with help when she was 9 years old. I am grateful for all the hardships that we had to endure in our lives. Being a mother of a special child strengthened my perception of what is important in this world. For the last 12 years, I have been gradually grown to be a better human being.\n\nAs with my son, it is a different story - he thinks that life is not fair to him. Even though he loves his sister he was not happy about what he must go through. Still, he couldn’t accept the fact that his sister is a special child. Just when I am getting the hang of life with my daughter, life prescribed me another problem to deal with through my teenage son and I am finding ways to cope with that now.\nHave I studied philosophies other than Stoicism? If so, which? How long I have been interested in stoicism?\nWithout even knowing the meaning of stoicism, I have been trying to be a stoic for a long time. I started learning about stoicism for more than a year now. My interest in learning Psychology (since my daughter was born) led me to learn about Philosophy. During the beginning of the last year, I listened to a podcast named “Philosophize This!” This podcast is about the introduction to all philosophies throughout all of the time. I listened to all the episodes starting from the Ionian age (pre-Socratic age) - from Thales, Heraclitus and Democritus up to the Hellenistic age. I came to know about stoicism along with other important philosophies such as epicureanism, cynicism, and skepticism during learning about the Hellenistic age. I couldn’t continue to the next episode without learning more about stoicism.\n\nBooks I have been reading \nThrough the podcast, I came to know about Marcus Aurelius’ “Meditations”. I have read this book and it has changed my life in many ways. Any time of the day If I do not feel contented or I am anxious about anything, I pick up the book and read any one of the pages. I feel better right away. This book talks to me. Although I don’t complain about my problems, that was not enough for me to deal with them. I read “Meditations” at least 30 minutes every day. I have started applying what I learned from this book into every aspect of life. Problems didn’t vanish magically, but I just feel fine amidst of all the happenings. \n\nCurrently, I am reading “Discourses and selected writings of Epictetus”. I can say I found my strength after reading this book. This is the manual that I was looking for.  An example is that because I was afraid that I wouldn’t be able to handle my daughter on the plane, I have been postponing the trips to India. After I start reading “Enchiridion”, I was able to travel to India. When we were in the plane for a long duration, every time I was confronted with a challenge, one of the quotes by Epictetus came to my mind and I was at peace with the happenings. It was a great experience for me! I was very proud of myself!\n \nDo I consider myself to be a Stoic? \nI strongly believe that stoicism agrees with my way of thinking.  Learning stoicism is helping me to manage the anxieties in everyday life. The best advice that I got from stoicism is to expect that things won’t happen the way that I want it to happen. Since I started learning about stoicism, I feel that I see clarity in the way I deal with unexpected events in life. With changes like that, it appears that life has become much easier with lesser anxieties. \n\nI can say that I am greatly influenced by Stoicism. Either by chance and or by design, there are a few habits that I already have like that of what a stoic has. Few of them are journal writing, healthy eating, and focusing on myself but not on externals. I heard it is difficult to be a stoic. I think I have what it takes, and I just need the guidance to become one.\n\nWhat do I want to get from this course? \n\nI am committed to living a contended life rest of the time that nature allows me to stay on this earth. I realize that as time passes by, I am going to get older and there will be limitations to my physical abilities. Therefore, I would like to keep my ruling faculty in its power to its potential if I could. I am sure that with stoicism I can achieve what I want by practicing every day.\n\nThrough the limited information about stoicism, I can confront the impressions that come to me without getting anxious. From this course, I want to understand the thinking process to help become a stoic, who possesses the tools that are needed to live a confident and contented life. With the gained knowledge, I would also like to inspire others around me to live a happy life. By completing this course, I believe that I can become a practicing stoic.

Having been brought up in a Christian household and attended Christian schools many questions arose in my mind.\n I was born in a small town in Kenya, both my grandfathers (Maternal and paternal) were Lay readers in the Anglican church. Therefore, attending church was a must every Sunday. I went through all the rituals and drama. My mother, however, broke away from the Anglican church at a time when Christian evangelism had stated peeking its head in the Kenyan/African religious atmosphere. "Witness!" the preachers used to say, there was dancing and lots of "speaking in tongues". At about the same time my sisters and I were attending catholic primary school and ultimately a Seventh-day Adventist high school. These variances of beliefs in the same religion left many questions unanswered. I once saw people fight and get rushed to the hospital because an argument arose regarding who was right between SDA and Anglicans on the right day to go to church. There must be another way to look at religion or nothing at all. For that matter, I started looking around for other teachings.\nI came across intellectualism through a friend in high school. The Socratic thoughts to be more specific. At the time books were scarce and I was in an SDA school thus finding these writings wasn\'t easy. I gave up my search and gave up church citing indifference in the Christian teachings. My family then immigrated to the USA and I suddenly had lots of material in front of me. I remember focusing on Plato’s Allegory of the Cave.\n "If all you ever see is shadows on a wall, you\'ll think that those shadows are reality. You\'d never suspect the real world outside the cave" Socrates asserts.\nThese words made me reflect on my spiritual life. The things that I have been brought up believing, are different from what most of my school mates and colleges were told. I realized most topics ranging from religion to geography were all a matter of theories and conjecture. Not everyone belied in heaven and or hell. This was eye-opening; mostly because I only knew of two religions growing up; Islam and Christianity both Abrahamic faiths. I didn\'t falter in my search. I opened Plato’s Apology which contains a wealth of information and quotable sentences such as the famous\n“The unexamined life is not worth living” and\n“I do believe that there are gods, and in a far higher sense than that in which any of my accusers believe in them.”\n Thus, I began my re-education. I went through the Greek Pantheon, Roman Pantheon, Upanishads, etc. and endeavored to understand this God or gods for that matter. I then came across The Evolution of God by Robert Wright. This was a summary of how gods become God from an intellectual perspective. The fall of 2011, I knocked at the masonic door, was initiated and Raised at the Most Worshipful Prince Hall Grand Lodge of Nebraska, begun my education into the rituals and mystery schools of antiquity. I went on to the RAM degrees and subsequently into the Scottish rite consistory. In this period, I become an ardent student of The Rosicrucian Order, AMORC and did the rituals and correspondence courses, after which I sort out The Theosophical teachings of Madam Blavatsky from the Theosophical society, taking the correspondence courses. At the same time reading occult books such as Eliphas Levi’s transcendental magic and the Kybalion by the three initiates.\nAt the end of the day, the sum of this knowledge amounts to "NOTHING". I have come full circle because I am no longer aware of where my beliefs/faith lie. The question “Would you call yourself an atheist, agnostic/skeptic, deist, theist?” becomes very difficult to answer. I\'ll give it a shot: I am NOT an atheist. I believe in a higher power, God/the gods, Moira the universe as its attested by our being. Am I agnostic/skeptic? if we look at it from the definition "Agnosticism is the position of believing that knowledge of the existence or non-existence of God is impossible." Then I am. We cannot for sure say there is no divine being, neither can we refute it as a fact. I do subscribe to the notion that that human knowledge is limited to the natural world, that the mind is incapable of knowledge of the supernatural. Am I a deist? As said in the earlier response, the belief of a divine being is exemplified by our being thus the source of religious knowledge should come from reason and observation of the natural world, revelation has no place, revelation, in this case, being; the revealing or disclosing of some form of truth or knowledge through communication with a deity or other supernatural. When was the last time I spoke to God or a god? Am I a theist? Yes, I believe in the existence of a God or gods, specifically of a creator who intervenes in the universe mostly because of my upbringing. So, what I\'m I? If we must shove me in a category, I am a Theideistic skeptic.\nAll these said, dear reader, you must have recognized my search for the all-knowing has been outside endeavor; Separating myself and searching from without rather than within; even as the words “know they self” have rung in all the mystery and philosophical school, they have never rung as loud as stoic philosophy. I have read about stoicism but never paid attention since I was assuming it\'s another dogma that I did not want to subscribe to. But then Daniel N. Robinson\'s The Great Ideas of Philosophy gave me a different perspective and I began reading about stoicism. I started with The beginners guide to stoicism by Matthew J. Van Natta and Ryan Holiday\'s the obstacle is the way. This paved the way to reading the Enchiridion by Epictetus and currently looking into Seneca’s Letters from a Stoic. When I think about it I think I was introduced to stoicism without knowing by Paulo Coelho’s Manuscripts found in Accra.\nThe attainment of knowledge and wisdom from within, to understand myself especially to be able to deal with some personal turmoil that I have gone through. In addition to the search of the divine. To stop judging myself harshly, to find balance and peace in my life as years go by and to live it in the best way possible among others are what I search from Stoicism and hope that this course will steer me in the right direction.\n\n', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, '', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', 0, 0, '', ''),

My father, who was a school teacher, must have awakened at the prompting of my mother.  They had done this routine 6 times before in the last 18 years.  He drove her to the hospital, dropped her off, went back home and got the other kids up and ready for school.  He taught as usual that day, and then after work, went by the hospital to see my mother and me.\n\nThe place was a typical western United States town.  The local economy was supported by the hundreds of farmers who grew potatoes, corn, beets, onions and wheat.  Most of the food was sent to the regional frozen food processing center.  My grandfather worked with other locals to rent, then buy out Oregon Frozen Foods Company.  With the advent of new food-freezing technology, they were able to expand their line of food and later re-branded the company to Ore-Ida, which was famous for their tater-tots.  The name Ore-Ida is based on the location of the food factory, which was built on the Oregon side of the Snake River, between Oregon and Idaho.  The name of the town was and still is Ontario.\n\nTwo aspects molded my character more than any other factor in my life: being the youngest of seven children, and being raised in the Mormon church.  My life was largely sheltered.  I spent many hours, in my childhood, playing on the local community college campus, which previously had been the local golf course.  My siblings, my dad and I would spend evenings on the campus, in the great big grassy fields, playing baseball, throwing the frees-bee, playing touch-football and riding bikes.  The summer evenings were long in my hometown.\n\nOntario had the unique location to be the western-most city in the U.S. Mountain time zone.  As such, in the summer, the sun would not set until very late and we had many hours in the evening to play.  The summer days were so long, that on the 4th of July, we did not start our firework celebrations until almost 11pm.\n\nElementary school was memorable and fun.  I\'ve only ever been in one physical fight in my life - the one in 4th grade.  Joe K. was being mean and I forget what we got into an argument about, but we ended up hitting each other and rolling on the ground.  After few back and forths, we both had had enough and went back to other recess activities.  On another day, I found a rock on the concrete play yard.  It must have found its way from the gravel parking lot next to the school yard.  I decided to throw it back into the parking lot.  It skipped on the cement, took a right turn and landed in Mrs. Betts\' car headlight.  My heart sunk and I tried to pretend like nothing happened.  But another kid must\'ve told the teacher, who told Mrs. Betts, who then told my father that day at the school administration office when they were picking up their paychecks.  My father confronted me at home.  I tried to deny it at first, but was caught in my lie.  My punishment was to pick up trash in the adjacent weed field, next to our house, after which I would earn enough money to pay for the headlight repair.\n\nMiddle school got off to a rough start, but ended well.  Some of the kids from other elementary schools didn\'t like me.  I presume it was because they had my father as their teacher in a previous grade.  They thought him too strict and consequently took it out on me in the form of soft-bullying.  But by the time I left middle-school, I had become friends with most of them.  One memorable, yet embarrassing event from Middle school was being taught the definition of the word "dildo" by my teacher Mr. Ogawa.  I had written the word on the chalkboard, thinking it meant "dummy" or "idiot."  But as Mr. Ogawa explained to me in front of the whole class, it was in fact a sex toy.  I stopped using that word thereafter.\n\nHigh school is where I made the most gains, physically and intellectually.  My focus on my school work improved dramatically; including achieving straight A\'s my junior and senior years.  I was involved with student government, Honors Society, Boy Scouts and sports, including basketball, football and track.  My senior year did not turn out exactly as I had expected.  I had intended to make the basketball team again and be a significant force on the team.  But teacher-parent politics came into play, and to the shock of many people, I did not make the final cut.  After some contemplation, I decided that the most important thing for me was the time spent with my friends playing basketball.  I talked to my coach and asked if I could still practice with the team, even though I was cut.  He allowed it and the experience proved to be a highly enjoyable time in my life - playing basketball with my friends and rooting for them in the stands during the games.\n\nAfter high school graduation, I spent one year in college at Brigham Young University, then spent two years serving a religious mission for my church in Guatemala.  I learned to not only speak Spanish, but also one of the twenty-eight Mayan dialects.  Through many hikes, rain storms, tragedies and illnesses, I learned much about self-reliance, self-discipline and work.  The time spent in Guatemala, was perhaps more mentally challenging than physically; especially being away from my family for two years.\n\nI returned to college at BYU, after my religious mission, and completed my degree in Business Information Systems.  During these years, I met my wife and spent many hours studying and preparing for my career.  Originally, I intended to study accounting, but after watching the documentary Revenge of the Nerds, which was about the founders of Apple and Microsoft, I determined that studying information systems was a better fit.  I graduated with a decent GPA and then landed a job working for a major oil and gas company in Dallas, Texas.  After a few years working full-time, I applied for the Masters of Business Administration program at Southern Methodist University.  I was accepted attended school part time, while continuing to work full time.  I later graduated with an MBA degree and an emphasis in Finance in 2006.\n\nOver the next 15 years, I worked and with my wife, raised a family.  We eventually moved to Houston, Texas, where we have been living since 2009.  The year 2014 was a major turning point in my life.  After suffering years of cyclical bouts of depression, I began to seriously contemplate ending my life.  After a complete break down and realizing how selfish that act would be to my wife and four children, I reached out for help.  My local religious leader offered me some counsel, including advising me to talk with a therapist.\n\nIn May 2014, I began to see a therapist who was trained to use Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT).  She helped me see that I was living in a very strong "Type A" community, working for a "Type A" corporation and attending church in a "Type A" religion.  She helped me put things in the proper perspective.  During this time, I decided to re-evaluate my religion\'s truth claims.  Between the time of May 2014 and December 2016, my wife and I came to the conclusion that our church was not truthful about its claims and subsequently, we stopped attending church in December 2018.\n\nShortly after I began to visit with my therapist in 2014, I began to study the underpinnings of CBT.  This lead me to Donald Robertson and my introduction to Stoicism.  I quickly began to read as much as I could about Stoicism.  Ryan Holiday\'s books, The Daily Stoic and The Obstacle is the Way, were perhaps the first books I read on Stoicism.  After that, I decided to dive into Marcus Aurelius.  I read Meditations two or three times and then on the fourth time, I decided to really study it and deconstruct in.  During the period of 2016 through the end of 2017, I read Pierre Hadot\'s The Inner Citadel and then re-read Meditations while commentating on many passages.  All of this can be found on my blog (rockyrook.com).  Pierre Hadot\'s perspective on Stoicism rings true with me.  The way he explains Meditations and the structure of Stoicism completely unlocked the philosophy for me.  It was also during these years of 2014-2017, that I participated in Stoic week.\n\nAfter completing my commentary on Meditations, I focused on Epictetus.  I read and wrote a lot on his Discourses and Encheridion.  After focusing on Epictetus in 2018 and 2019, I read John Sellars book Stoicism along with William Irvine\'s book A Guide to the Good Life; then Donald Robertson\'s books Stoicism and the Art of Happiness and How to Think Like a Roman Emperor.  Recently (as of December 2019), I\'ve read Ward Farnsworth\'s The Practicing Stoic and Pierre Hadot\'s Philosophy as a Way of Life.  I\'ve also listened to hours of podcasts, including Chris Fischer\'s Stoicism on Fire multiple times.  And while I\'ve read many passages from Seneca, I\'ve not focused on him as heavily as the others.  One of my goals in 2020, is to read and commentate on much of Seneca, like I\'ve done with Marcus Aurelius and Epictetus.  I know that Seneca has written a lot and therefore made the decision to focus on him last, of the three Roman Stoics.\n\nIt seems to me, there are a couple of major modern Stoic camps, which are divided over the topic of God.  The modern Stoics focus less on God and seem to be very agnostic and/or atheist.  While the other camp, the traditional Stoics, readily acknowledge God or at least some deity in the cosmos.  After reading Epictetus, I concluded I fall under the traditional camp.  I don\'t believe in a single, universal God, but my heart tends to tilt toward pantheism, where I believe there is piece of divinity in each human and collectively we are working to be one, not unlike the God in Scott Adams\' book God\'s Debris.\n\nI consider myself a prokopton.  While I am endeavoring to help spread Stoicism in my life with those I work, I feel like I could take my personal practice much further.  I am active in the local Stoic chapter in Houston Texas, and have been since its inception.  And at this point in my life, I feel like the world and my community and my workplace, could use more Stoic philosophy, to help people be more wise - and I feel this is an area in which I could help significantly.  To this end, I want to deepen my personal understanding and practice of Stoicism.  Furthermore, I want to use my knowledge and experience to help make my community and workplace become more focused on wisdom.\n\nWhile I feel I have a good understanding of the Disciplines of Assent, Desire and Action, I feel like I lack technical understanding of logic, physics and some ethics.  My hope is that a knowledgeable mentor would guide me and push me to deepen my understanding in these areas and introduce me to any other areas in which I may need help.

I was going through a difficult time in life and I was drawn to it as a life philosophy. \n\nI have listened to and taken notes on Chris Fischer’s Traditional Stoicism Podcast “Stoicism on Fire” three times. After initial apprehension, I have found myself drawn and attempting to practice Traditional Stoicism over Modern Stoicism. Chris Fischer’s “Stoicism on Fire” podcast and website is how I discovered College of Stoic Philosophers. \n\nI consider myself a practicing Stoic and I assist with curriculum for the Stoic Fellowship - Minnesota Stoics. We have meetings at libraries around the Twin Cities (MN) twice a month. I am currently assisting our group leader, Gabriel, with January’s meetup on impressions and assent. \n\nI am creating my own “Stoicism Hypomnemata” which consists of twenty plus pages of quotes, thoughts & concepts to have at hand (via my phone) to aid in my practice of Stoicism and share with my fellow Minnesota Stoic classmates. To sum up in this quote by Pierre Hadot...\n\n“For Marcus, the essential thing was not to invent or to compose, but to influence himself and produce an effect upon himself. Even if this effect was efficacious at one moment, however, it would soon loose its strength and the exercise would have to be begun again in order constantly to revive the certitude derived from the striking formulations of the principles and rules of life.” (Hadot) \n\nWhen I am not able to immediately dive into my Stoicism Hypomnemata, I attempt to keep these 5 personal Stoic keywords in mind and apply at all times: \n\n1. Prosoche (attention) \n2. Aequanimitas (mental calmness)\n3. Diamon (ruling faculty)\n4. Dogmata (judgments)\n5. Hit et nunc (here and now)\n\nBeing primarily a full time musician, a practical way the practice of Stoicism has helped me is the realization that I can only attempt to perform, compose and record to the best of my abilities and how my performance is received is outside the sphere of choice. I have noticed that I have become much more comfortable on stage and confident in my performing abilities. Sample quotes that I keep at hand in regards to scenarios like this are: \n\n“Take a lyre player: he’s relaxed when he performs alone, but put him in front of an audience, and it’s a different story, no matter how beautiful his voice or how well he plays the instrument. Why? Because he not only wants to perform well, he wants to be well received — and the latter lies outside his control.” Epictetus\n\n“He too spoke well - whoever it was, for his identity was uncertain - who said, when asked why he took so much trouble over a piece of craftsmanship that would never reach more than a very few people: “A few is enough for me; so is one; so is none.” Seneca\n\nI also teach therapy dog work with my golden retriever, Copper, for a non-profit organization, Canine Inspired Change. We work with level 4 schools and the juvenile detention center in St Paul (Ramsey Co), MN. Another practical example of how Stoicism applies in day to day life is, many of our students can be quite challenging and sometimes possibly dangerous. Stoicism helps me keep my temper, listen to my inner diamon and keep my wits about me in chaotic situations. Another quote I keep on hand in regards to this is... \n\n“What is it to be insulted? Stand by a stone and insult it; what will you gain? And if you listen like a stone, what will be gained by the one who insults you?” Epictetus\n\n“Our interpretations can make things appear to be insults when some should be put aside, others laughed at, others forgotten.” Seneca\n\n“If you don’t want to be bad-tempered, then don’t feed the habit, throw nothing before it on which it can feed and grow. First of all, keep calm, and count the days in which you haven’t lost your temper - ‘I used to lose my temper every day, and after that, every other day, then every third day, then every fourth’ - and if you continue in that way for thirty days, offer a sacrifice to God. For the habit is first weakened, and then completely destroyed.” Epictetus\n\nI am interested in the College of Stoic Philosophers to continue to internalize the teachings and history of the Stoics, bring it into daily practice and share it with others who are interested. I eventually would very much like to participate in the Marcus Aurelius school. \n\nI was born and raised Catholic in the small town of Turtle Lake, WI. Before Stoicism, I would consider myself a cafeteria Catholic/agnostic. Now I’m very drawn to the idea of a rational and providential structure of the universe. Here’s a couple quotes by Chris Fischer (my favorite modern Stoic) about the matter & Marcus...\n\n“If this is nothing more than a placebo (a harmless pill, medicine, or procedure prescribed more for the psychological benefit to the patient than for any physiological effect) it’s a damn good one. To those when then claim “well, I can’t make myself believe the world is providentially ordered!” Agreed. But you can allow yourself to live as if it is and see what happens.” (Fischer)\n\n“Death, disease, natural disasters, etc. are not considered punishments from an angry God, they are simply the natural unfolding of events within a web of causes most of which are outside of our control.” (Fischer)\n\n“Universal Nature’s impulse was to create an orderly world. It follows, then, that everything now happening must follow a logical sequence; if it were not so, the prime purpose towards which the impulses of the World-Reason are directed would be an irrational one. Remembrance of this will help you to face many things more calmly.” Marcus\n\nBooks I’ve read on Stoicism: \nStoicism (Sellars) \nInner Citadel: The Meditations of Marcus Aurelius  (Hadot) \nEpictetus: A Stoic and Socratic Guide to Life (Long) \nThe Practicing Stoic (Farnsworth)\nLessons in Stoicism (Sellars)\nHow to Think Like a Roman Emperor (Robertson) \nThe Art of Living (Sellars) \nThe Little Book of Stoicism (Salzgeber)\nStoic Spiritual Exercises (Buzare) \nHow To Be a Stoic (Pigliucci)\nThe Daily Stoic (Holiday)\nA Guide to the Good Life (Irvine)\nA Fortunate Storm (Chakrapani)\nHow to Be Free (Epictetus) Long\nDialogues (Seneca) \nDiscourses, Fragments, Handbook (Epictetus)\nMediations (Marcus) \nLetters from a Stoic (Seneca) *NOT COMPLETED \nLectures and Fragments (Rufus) *NOT COMPLETED\nCambridge Companion to the Stoics (Inwood) *PARTIALLY READ ', 1, '2020-05-12', 1, 0, 0, '', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', 1, 0, '', ''),

I was born and raised in Indiana, with a short jaunt out of State to neighboring Columbus, OH for my first job out of college, which is where I met my wife, Haleigh, while she was studying at Ohio State University. We had an exciting 2019, getting married and buying our first house. We now live in Indianapolis with our dog, Lola. I am currently the Senior Manager of Business Development at an e-commerce company.\n\nAfter going to business school at the behest of my parents, landing a job that allowed me to climb the corporate ladder, and getting my MBA, I thought I had made it to the top of the mountain. No sooner had this feeling of accomplishment and ‘fulfillment’ been planted, it was forcibly uprooted and left me bruised and broken at the base of said mountain. While making my way through the gauntlet of serious parental illness/medical issues, multiple unexpected job losses, and major personal relationship strain, I feel as if someone nudged me and finally woke me up. I was able to clearly see how much of a façade this mountain actually was and how artificial and meaningless the things were that I had so desperately focused and spent so much mental & physical energy on. That nudge, as it turns out, was Stoicism.\n\nMy mental/spiritual journey began a couple years ago, initially dipping my toe into a few different areas and wading waist deep into Buddhism, thinking I had found my calling. While diligently working to master the art of meditation, I continued to be more drawn to philosophy and found myself getting lost in the pages of Plato and Socrates in my spare time, which then segued into Marcus Aurelius, Seneca, and Epictetus. While Buddhism and other philosophies were fun and intriguing to study, Stoicism has had, by far, the biggest impact on me. I find myself routinely having jaw-dropping moments while reading or listening to Stoic texts or lectures.\n\nWhile doing chores around the house or driving, I will typically throw on a video/lecture about Stoicism to listen to. A few of my favorite books so far are Epictetus’ Enchiridion, Meditations of Marcus Aurelius, and A Guide to The Good Life, The Ancient Art of Stoic Joy by William B. Irvine. One of the most profound aspects of reading Stoic texts, for me, is the similarity in thought patterns from individuals living thousands of years ago on the other side of the world to myself, living in modern times and experiencing life in a totally different way. There are times when I have, after re-reading a page to ensure I absorbed it correctly, had to ask myself; how in the world was someone on the other side of the globe, two-thousand years ago, thinking about a situation/topic in such a relatable way? This ‘bridge’ to the past has been extremely rewarding to cross and has inspired me to continue the long, arduous process of shedding ingrained habits and viewpoints. Reading essays and books on Stoicism that eloquently describe examples and tactics of how to turn an ancient philosophy into an executable way of life has been really fun and exciting to experience. I am very interested in continuing to learn more about the origins of the philosophy and how to incorporate it into more aspects of my life.\n\nI was born into a Christian household and attended church service pretty much every Sunday until I departed for college. I never truly felt like a ‘believer’, it was just something that my brothers and I had to do on Sundays, and we got used to it. Looking back now, it was valuable in the sense of being equipped with at least a basic understanding of Christianity, as it is referenced/relatable to many aspects of life and learning. I now consider myself to be agnostic/skeptic, with an openness and acceptance of people who believe in any religion or philosophy of life, so long as it is peaceful.\n\nThere are two main things I am looking to get out of this course. First is direction. Over the last several years, I have experienced a radical transformation in the way I view the world, interact with others, and ultimately live my life. I’ve struggled tremendously trying to maintain ‘normalcy’ in my relationships, both personal and professional. I’ve lost interest in most of the hobbies that used to consume a lot of my time and I’m actively searching for people and activities that are more conducive to this new outlook and philosophy of life. I find myself reading, studying, and deeply thinking about Stoicism often, but haven’t been able to find a way to put it into action outside of personal mental development, which is obviously important. I often think about Marcus’s advice for the mornings; “I have to go to work – as a human being. What do I have to complain of, if I’m going to do what I was born for – the things I was brought into the world to do?” The problem is that Stoicism has caused me to realize that I don’t know what my true ‘purpose’ is while simultaneously motivating me to put effort into my purpose. I am inspired to live in accordance with nature, I just don’t know where my place or responsibility is in this nature. The work I do seems so pointless most days, realizing I am not advancing humanity in any way or providing much value to others.\n\nThe second thing I’d like to get out of this course is the ability to coherently pass along the teachings and basic understanding of Stoicism to others. I continuously find myself being profoundly moved by things I read and learn, but stumble and trip over my words when trying to explain what it means, either to me specifically or in general. Ultimately, however, I would be extremely happy with simply expanding my Stoic network, learning more about the philosophy, and being able to take what I learn and live a more virtuous life while focusing on things that are in my control.\n \nRespectfully,\nJohn Collins\n', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, '', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', 0, 0, '', ''),

I could not tie my own shoes nor hold a pencil properly until around the age of 7. I did not like to play with other children, but had a rich fantasy life which took up probably an unhealthy percentage of my waking hours.  And I was completely obsessed with astronomy and extinct animals (mostly those featured on the show Walking With Dinosaurs and its sequel: Walking With Beasts).  \n\nAt the age of 7, I received a diagnosis of Asperger Syndrome (high functioning Autism), and this combined with my apparent inability to function in a mainstream classroom meant I was sent to a special school.  A decision which effectively ended my formal education for the rest of my childhood and adolescence, though I did not realise this until after I had graduated at the age of 18.  \n\nNot satisfied with the employment opportunities that were available to me, I decided to return to school and take The Leaving Cert Applied course.  To the astonishment of my teachers, I greatly exceeded LCA standards in nearly every class, and it was subsequently recommended that I should transfer to mainstream classes.  A decision my parents (who I still lived with and was very much financially dependent on) were initially against, and this led to serious tension which I don’t think our relationship ever fully recovered from.  \n\nIn any event, I did switch to the mainstream classes, and once again I exceeded expectations by far outpacing the other students in every class, with the exception of mathematics where I was a more average student.  More than one teacher told me I was among the brightest students they had ever taught, and while this did make me happy in a way, it was also a source of great frustration and resentment when I reflected on how much further I might be in life had my talents been discovered earlier.\n\nUnfortunately, this was also the period when I first began to struggle with the depression that has continued to be an issue for me to this day.  I was very arrogant and dismissive of other students, and this led to a rather isolated existence: which fed into the attitude of misanthropy which had been developing even before I began The LCA.  \n\nMy home life was actually worse than at school.  My parents had for a while been growing understandably frustrated with my behaviour, which was often gloomy, angry or impolite.  However, I felt, and still do feel, that they were unable or unwilling to acknowledge either the source or the extent of my unhappiness.  As such they made no real effort to get through to me, but instead took every opportunity to let me know how frustrated and disappointed they were .  \n\nNevertheless, I attained my Leaving Cert and finally began my third level studies.  I had decided I wanted to be a Psychologist, but I was also interested in Philosophy, History and Literature, so I chose a course in The Humanities which included modules in all these disciplines.  Over the course of three years I found a small group of friends (I remained unpopular with most of the college because I was still arrogant and dismissive, but also because young people aren’t always the most understanding when it comes to socially unusual behaviour), and my marks remained high for at least the first two years.\n\nThen in third year I became political: a switch which proved to be both wonderful and disastrous in different ways.  I became obsessed with Ayn Rand to the exclusion of all other philosophers (which was bad, given that she wasn’t on my course but other philosophers were), and this lead to heavy involvement in Libertarian and Conservative circles: so much so that I failed third year through not handing in most of my coursework. \n\nRather than repeat, I dropped out for a year: abandoning my previous ambitions and instead trying to live some Ayn Rand fantasy of becoming a successful author (a dream I’ve had since I was 11 but put off while pursuing my educational goals, and which I am actively working toward still), and influencing the world with my brilliant ideas that were obviously so much more rational than what they teach on philosophy and psychology courses.  \n\nHowever, as embarrassing as it is to admit such pretensions, my involvement with Libertarianism did open up a lot of opportunities for traveling around Europe and meeting interesting people.  My list of friends grew larger than I ever imagined, and I got to experience some of the social benefits I had missed out on in earlier life.  \n\nAs time went by, however, I became sceptical of certain aspects of the libertarian vision, and was far to fond of voicing this scepticism as well as criticising the direction of groups I was involved with.  For these reasons, as well as some others that are more personal, I drifted away from the liberty movement and soon discovered that most of the friends I thought I had made were no longer interested in me.  \n\nI also came to realise the foolishness of my decision to leave college, as well as my dismissive attitude toward what was taught there.  However, I returned having lost most of my social network as well as the philosophy which had given strength and hope for the future.  I entered into the longest and most severe state of depression I have yet experienced, and consequently my marks became sub-par.  \n\nI was halfway through fourth year when I finally decided to seek help from the college counsellor,  whom I credit with helping me to recover at least enough that I could persue other avenues of self-improvement.  Jordan Peterson also became a very helpful influence, and I largely credit him with convincing me that political ideology is less important than focusing on the state of your own life and those in your immediate sphere.  However, it wasn’t until I was introduced to the basic concepts of Stoicism (oddly enough through a video from the YouTube channel Valuetainment, rather than through my philosophical studies, which were after all part of a larger course and therefore had to skip a lot of things) that things really started to turn around.  \n\nOnce my curiosity was triggered, I found and started listening to the Stoicism on Fire podcast on iTunes, and with each episode my fascination grew.  I read more articles and watched more videos on the topic than I can remember.  At some point (I could not say exactly when) I realised I had made the transition from student of philosophy to Stoic prokopton, and that my life was already better for it.  Consequently, I read Meditations by Marcus Aurelius, the Obstacle is The Way and The Daily Stoic by Ryan Holiday, and am currently reading The Discourses of Epictetus.  \n\nWhat I most like about Stoicism is the emphasis on how one should live rather than on solving abstract problems (though simultaneously I admire the Stoic contributions to logic).  This is also the thing which drew me to Objectivism before I realised the unhealthy nature of that philosophy.  However, Stoicism also provides one with practical guidance on how to achieve the kind of discipline necessary to a virtuous life, and it is this discipline which has helped me.  Through learning to discard the things over which I have no control, I have been able to let go of most of what has been haunting me about the past.  Though I admit there are things which I still find painful to reflect on, I’m gradually learning to look back with appreciation on all the good times I have had, and even upon the bad times since it was from these that I learned the most valuable lessons.  I’ve stopped chastising myself for the bad attitude I used to have, as well as worrying about how my delayed education makes me seem to others.  At 28, I’ve even let go of the misanthropy I entertained since the age of 18.\n\nI believe my mental health has improved greatly in large part because of Stoicism (in tandem with psychology and counselling, naturally).  In the last few months I have found work which I greatly enjoy as an English Language Teacher, and have continued to work toward my life goals with indifference toward set backs and other things that would previously have upset me a great deal.  I am trying to apply Stoicism in all aspects of my life, and have even turned away from my long-held atheism in favour of devotion to the Stoic God.  Nonetheless I know I still have much to learn and practice, and only hope that in time I will have progressed sufficiently to help others in the way that other Stoics, both modern and ancient, have helped me.\n', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, '', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', 0, 0, '', '');

I have read “Enchiridion” ,“Meditations” by M.A., “How To Be A Stoic” by Pigliucci, and the “Daily Stoic”. In my new found love of Stoicism, I began a local meet-up group called “Monterey Stoics”. Currently, we have ten members who regularly attend weekly meetings on Sunday mornings from 7:30am-8:30 am. To give structure to the meetings, I selected “Handbook for New Stoics”, by Pigliucci. I believe the early morning time works as a sort of “screening device” to test the resolve of those who are interested! I facilitate these meetings. We have lively and thought-provoking conversations. There are atheists, theists, agnostics, and non-religious attending. \n\nUpbringing and Significant Rites of Passage\nI was raised Lutheran/Theist in a small farming community in Nebraska. I very much appreciate the loving home and supportive parents and family life I was fortunate to have been given. However, after coming out as gay at 18, I had to re-look at a different way of being in the world that was more authentic. This was a very significant turning point in my life, and for my parents.  I left the Christian model of my upbringing and began a search for a more inclusive way of considering metaphysics/spirituality and purpose in life. I spent a year in Japan as an exchange student, saw how another society worked beautifully without the Judeo-Christian input. I studied Zen Buddhism and returned to the U.S. to enter college where I studied music and pre-med in preparation for a career in chiropractic. Continuing studies for my career, I also studied other religions, philosophies (Existentialism, Hegel, Kierkegaard, Neo-Platonism) then became an atheist for a number of years. Admittingly, I felt un-fulfilled as an atheist as there was still what can only be described as a “soul-yearning” for a deeper sense of connection to the Cosmos. After years of pondering and reading works of Jung, Gurdjieff, and early church writers (Origen, Dionysius, Desert Fathers/Mothers,) I found a new way of looking at life as an evolutionary journey. I was also greatly influenced by writers of Zen Buddhism, Quakerism and Meister Eckhart. \n\nI became a chiropractor and practiced for twenty three years through ups and downs of the pleasures and pitfalls of owning my own business. This proved to be an excellent training ground in what I learned later to be called “the dichotomy of control”. While the benefits of helping people get well were rewarding, the stress and strain of making a living in a slowly marginalized and less paid-for profession became unsustainable. I left the profession for a more stable career path. This began a three year period from 2013-2015 of soul-searching, and self-reflection. I journaled, studied positive psychology, took career and ability tests, had coaching from a career counselor. I found school psychology to be an excellent match both for my growth, involvement with a greater community, and summers off to read, write and travel with my partner who is also in education. I finished with my M.S. degree in School Psychology last year and am currently employed by an elementary school district. Throughout this career change, I maintained my reading of religious ways, including Sufism and Jewish mystical traditions – but the complex metaphysical and cultural references were barriers to my understanding. I returned again to an esoteric approach to Christianity.\n\nA Christian Deist\nThe short story is that it has taken thirty-three years to de-program myself from the Christian bible-thumping of my up-bringing. Then, I recently discovered a circuitous route back to a different kind of Christianity through an Episcopal priest. She joined the priesthood late in life, and we shared common ground in our parochial upbringing and religious searching. We enjoy discussing the relationships and similarities between Buddhism, Contemplative Christianity and Sufism, and she is also very interested in what I have told her about Stoicism. I enjoy having a spiritual friend as well as joining in the liberal humanistic/community services offered by this church. However, I consider myself a Deist and my participation in the weekly liturgy, music, creeds, reading of the bible, sermons, and rituals are but fingers “pointing to the moon” – all which give homage to the One.  I have long given up on heaven/hell, eternal damnation or even that Jesus was the “only son of God” in the traditional sense. If Jesus existed, he must’ve been quite a teacher; one (who like others) found in himself an integration of God/Cosmos/Matter, all our human birthright. Prayers offered by me are a way of focusing my mind on gratitude and what is possible for myself and humanity, not for asking that things be other than they are. “Not my will but Thy will be done, Oh Lord”. Meditations 4:23 by Markus Aurelius speaks to the same supplication. Like him, I also wish for the courage, temperance, wisdom, and justice to live with equanimity in the world.\n\nGoing Deeper Into Stoicism\nSo, I consider myself a practicing Stoic, and yet nearly passed off Stoicism as a dusted-off and dressed-up Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (which I also admire). However, after listening to the “traditional stoicism” podcasts by Chris Fisher, I was amazed (and relieved) to learn that there was an ontological side that involved our living in right relationship with the Cosmos. I was also intrigued by the idea that without this understanding of our relationship with Cosmos, “Neo-Stoicism” is missing an integral pillar of what is possible for spiritual development. I want to understand more fully this aspect of Stoicism. To do this, I will require a stronger foundation with guidance and accountability so that I may be a potential resource for this much needed way of living for myself, and for others – who may also desire a more fulfilling life. I wish to have a deeper understanding of the Stoic metaphysics and wonder how to attune to Nature through daily practice. \n\nThank you for considering me for this mentoring program.\n\n', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, '', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', 0, 0, '', ''),

All along it’s been a search for purpose and meaning.\n\nI was born in Cootamundra, a small rural town in the wheatbelt of rural NSW, Australia. My dad was a country cop while my mum looked after my sister and I. Our family moved according to his station placement, from small towns to tinnier outposts, for the first decade of my life. Eventually my mother had enough and demanded we move to a sizeable town, where we kids would grow up with more opportunities, before ending up in Canberra, Australia’s bush capital.\n\nIn Canberra, while growing up as a reasonably intelligent kid in schools dominated by football, I played D&D and messed with computers, getting plenty of experience dealing with insults along the way. At the completion of year 12 I started studying computer engineering at Canberra University. After a year I found the curriculum to be stifling, targeting developing in a large government departments (a far cry from my personal experience of making games), and aimed at a totally different career than I was interested in. I dropped out of Uni, got a job at KFC, and thus began my red neck phase.\n\nI drank and smoked a lot, learned how to rebuild cars, became racist and a homophobe. I  generally withdrew from, and was angry at myself, and the world. Eventually this phase led into older cars, 50s music, and the rockabilly scene, where I found a lot of like minded people. During this period I changed jobs a few times, eventually finding work as a mainframe computer operator, working shift work, and discovering a love of fishing and skiing.\n\nOne day Mark, a work colleague, invited me over to dinner with him and his wife. They had met travelling through Africa, while Mark was on a 7 month overseas adventure. After a great dinner, they put on a slide show with highlights from their combined 15 years of world travel. I was hooked. The next day I brought a ticket to Thailand and told work I was taking off for a year without pay.\n\nIt was an amazing, life changing, year. I discovered who I was when I didn’t feel compelled to match the image and expectations of people around me. I travelled for months through Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, and Nepal, before spending six months in India. \n\nThe whole trip seemingly guided me to finish up at McCloud Ganj, Northern India. This is a town with a large Tibetan refugee population, and the home of the exiled Dali Lama. It was a world away from anything in my life to that point and I left a different person. After 6 weeks living in, what was essentially, a small concrete cell attached to a small farm house in the Himalayas, I experimented with finding meaning through a Tibetan Buddhist meditation retreat. I left loving everyone, and meditation, but found Buddhism to be eating intellectually as concepts such as reincarnation and karma really did not sit well with me – I have since discovered there is a branch of Buddhism called “Rational Buddhism” which is a much closer intellectual fit.\n\nAs I left India, I knew the world was bigger than my previous experience suggested, and decided to study Philosophy to get a better handle on life. When I returned to Australia, I moved to Sydney, and commenced a Philosophy undergraduate degree at Macquarie University.\n\nUnfortunately I only realised, in the last semester of the degree, that there was no practical aspects of philosophy, or “meaning of life” stuff, to be found in the degree. It was basically epistemology and semiotics, though Nietzsche got close to giving me a sense on meaning. I left disappointed with Philosophy as an answer.\n\nAfter University I did some film and animation work before settling, about 15 years ago, on making computer games which has been my career ever since. Around 3 years ago, while reading Hacker News, I read about Stoicism, was intrigued, and got “A Guide to the Good Life” by William Irvine, and found it beautifully encapsulated what I had hoped to find at University. I tried to integrate Stoic ways of being into my life, but could not really get it to stick in any way I was happy with. I kept revisiting the book, and the pushed Stoicism back to my consciousness for a while, and found myself being a better person, but it kept fading out of my consciousness as the my ways of being reestablished themselves.\n\nOver the last six months I have placed a fresh emphasis on Stoicism, and have found a better balance by combining Stoicism and mindfullness meditation. I have followed up Irvine’s book by reading:\n\nMarcus Aurelius – Meditations\nEpictetus – Enchiridion \nJohn Sellars – Stoicism\nPigliucci – A Handbook for new Stoics\nRobertson – How to Think Like a Roman Emperor\n\nThe next on my list is Pierre Haidot’s “The Inner Citadel”, which will be followed by “Musonius Rufus – Lectures and Sayings”. I initially thought digging directly into the source material would be the best approach, but after reading Enchiridion, I decided that reading modern takes on Stoicism, alongside original source, proved a more productive approach for me.\n\nOn a personal level I am an atheist, and approach life with a perspective of scientific scepticism. I am an aspiring Stoic, but don’t feel I am far enough along the path to say I am a Stoic. I have two boys, an 8 and a 10 year old, so every morning I prepare myself to deal with egomaniacs and ingrates, and my responses still need a lot of work!\n\nIn the last month, in particular, I am starting to feel more of the Stoic philosophy become part of my conditioning. I’m convinced this is since I have started morning and evening routines, with a deliberate consciousness starting to seem into other parts of my day. I am hoping further study of the Stoics – particularly with a dialectic aspect, rather than just self study – will further cement this way of being.\n\n\nLooking forward to whatever comes next.', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, '', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', 0, 0, '', ''),

I lived there until I was 15 when I went away to a small hippie boarding school called Buxton. 90 students, we chopped our own wood. Buxton was a great experience (of course in hindsight I appreciate it more than I did when I was there..), and more than anything I feel it taught me how to think and stay curious to new ideas. \n \nAfter high school I took a year off, spending some of that time traveling in China, then went to Bard College for a year. I was interested in Italian and wanted to spend a semester abroad, but since that was only available to juniors, I decided to take a semester off and travel in Italy and Greece. After which I returned to Bard for a semester, then took another year off. During that year I drive cross country to live in Portland, OR for about 6 months, then drove down through Mexico for a few months, lived in Austin TX for a month, then back to Vermont until I started college again at Emerson in Boston a few months later. I finished my BA in Film from Emerson, then moved to San Francisco in 2008. \n \nSince I’ve been in San Francisco, I\'ve started a few small businesses, focused in the food world. The first, called forageSF, begun following my interest in foraging wild edible foods (which I picked up when I moved to CA). I started selling weekly boxes of gourmet wild edibles and mushrooms to customers, then from there the business expanded in several directions. I wanted to be cooking more, so I started an underground supper club called The Wild Kitchen. \nThese were dinners of from 40-100 guests, served an 8 course tasting menu focused on wild foraged foods that I’d collected. The idea was to highlight them in the dish, so not a totally foraged meal, but a way to expose people to the world of foraging. The dinners were hosted in warehouses, houseboats, rooftops, etc, and people didn\'t know the address until the day of the dinner (hence the “underground”). I hosted and was the chef of those about once a month for 6 years. Following and during that time I started an event called The Underground Market. \nA monthly food event where people would sell products they had made at home, without permits. Technically it was a “members only” event, so in a legal grey area. We had between 50 and 100 vendors at each event, and attendance of around 2500. Food, drinks, music, people waiting in line for hours to get in, it was fun. forageSF has now expanded into teaching foraging skills to urban folks. Daily excursions to learn how to forage mushrooms, seaweeds, and wild greens. \nThe market was eventually shut down 1.5 years later (not because anyone got sick, but for political reasons). When running the market, I had a dream of starting a shared kitchen for the community of chefs at my events. To fund it, I started a kickstarter, and raised $156K from the campaign from 1600 pledges, and in 2014 I opened the space with my cousin at business partner. To explain the idea: It’s a large shared kitchen used by 40 different companies (like a co-working space for food), everything from caterers to people making small products to sell in local stores or at farmers markets. We have a cafe in the front open to the public, we host local musicians, have big monthly food markets with music and drinks, and rent the space out for weddings and events. At the moment I\'m working on a book about the kitchen, to highlight the chefs in the space, as well as talk about my experiences over the last decade in the food world. \n \nDuring my 12 years in San Francisco, I’ve received a good amount of press. Cover of the NYTimes, named a “Local Hero” by SF Weekly, Top 30 most innovative people by 7x7 magazine.  In magazines and papers all over the world for my projects. I wasn\'t super famous, but got a good amount of notoriety. I don\'t say that to brag (and re-reading this, it almost hurts how cocky I sound…), but to lead to what I’ve found helpful in Stoicism. \n \nDuring that time, everything I did was to get more press and adulation. I enjoyed it, and I have no regrets, but I was jealous, envious of other people\'s success, suspicious of people trying to use me and copy my ideas, and generally just a not very nice person to a lot of folks. Surrounded by people, but feeling totally alone. What I’ve found in Stoicism is a way to diffuse so much of that. Probably a symptom of getting a bit older too, but now I really do approach projects as much as possible for their own sake. I worry much less about what people think, am nicer, and am generally much more calm in many aspects of my life. I\'m certainly no Sage, but I\'m consistently working towards getting better every day. \n \n \n \n \nHow long you have been interested in Stoicism.\n \nI\'ve been interested and reading on stoicism for about 2 years, more seriously in the past year. Two years ago I read my first book “A Guide to the Good Life”, and found it interesting, but didn’t start any kind of practice. A year ago I started becoming more serious about reading, as well as journaling. Practicing, listening to podcasts, starting to set reminders on my phone of stoic ideas I wanted to think about throughout the day. All together I have a fairly consistent stream of Stoic ideas bouncing around my head on any given day. I use them like weapons against the chaos when my mind starts to spin, and find they’re very effective at putting things into perspective. \nAny books you read on Stoic philosophy. If any, please list them.\nI\'ve read “A Guide To The Good Life”: now on my second read through, “The Art of Living”, by Sharon Lebell: I use this book as a kind of guide for my journaling, reading a section then reflecting on it, “Meditations”: Honestly haven\'t gotten through that, for some reason the Epictetus book draws me in more often, “The Second Mountain”: Haven\'t finished yet. Loved it when I started it but stalled in the middle. I also listen to “Stoic Meditations”: A podcast by Massimo Pigliucci, receive “The Daily Stoic” Newsletter, and have read a bit of “On Anger”.\n \nWould you call yourself an atheist, agnostic/skeptic, deist, theist?\n\nI am culturally Jewish, but didn’t grow up practicing. I would say I am somewhat spiritual, more of an earth spirit/energy direction, but honestly not sure exactly what that fits into. I\'m thirsty for faith, but also very rationally, which is probably why I’m drawn to Stoicism. I think about it as “Buddhism without the Buddha”. I find a lot of the same tenets that I see in Buddhism (which I like), but with a more straightforward and practical application.\nAre you a member of a religious faith? If so, which and for how long?\nSee above\nHave you studied philosophies other than Stoicism? If so, which?\nSome Buddhism\n\nDo you consider yourself to be a Stoic?\n\nI would say yes, I do. Not exactly sure what that means, but I do really enjoy the practice and ideas, and I\'ve found they’ve genuinely helped me. \n\nWhat you want to get from this course?\n\nSome events happened in my life in the last few years that motivated me to really look inside at how I was treating people, how much control I had over my mind, etc. I found that stoicism really helps to frame issues that we all go through, in a way that\'s makes it possible to view them from a more positive (or perhaps detached) vantage. I also love the similarities of issues the Stoics went through thousands of years ago to what we experience today. It\'s insane to me that the Emperor of Rome struggled with the same issues I do. It makes me realize how timeless they are, and therefore able to see them seem less worthy of so much trouble. \n \nSince I’ve started reading the Stoics I really have seen a change in my life, and I want to continue that. I’m nicer to friends, employees, and strangers. I don’t take things personally (at least not all the time…), I\'m able to control my emotions and not respond in anger (again, at least most of the time…), instead, giving myself time to reflect, almost always realizing anger is the wrong emotion. I have really taken the Memento Mori idea to heart. And as a result, I’ve made my will so if I die my family won’t have to deal with too many questions, I try to leave every interaction like it was my last, and find with that at the forefront of my mind, I treat people much better. It really has made a significant change in my life, and I want to continue and deepen my understanding. \n \nI\'m jealous when I read about the ancient schools where people learned and discussed these ideas. It\'s great to learn solo from a book, but I don’t have anyone in my life that can really help me move beyond my own understanding. That’s what I\'m looking for in this school. A mentor that can help me more deeply integrate Stoicism into my life, learn the teachings on a deeper level, and also help me to make my practice more consistent. \n\n', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, '', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', 0, 0, '', ''),

I am an American, 38 years old and currently live in Dubai, United Arab Emirates where I work as an Asbestos Consultant. I grew up on a farm in Southeastern North Carolina, went to a private Christian school and after graduation went on to the Fire Academy and became a firefighter in New Hanover County, North Carolina. After a few years I took a job working with the Fire Service with the US military in a Iraq during the Iraq War. I spent two years there, lost a few friends and finally came back to the US a changed man. After coming home I attended NC State University where I met my wife. I ran out of money towards the end of my program and took a job doing environmental work with an demolitions company, got married and promptly forgot about finishing my degree. I did finally come back and complete it though it would be 6 years before I did so. I consider myself a soldier/explorer type. I like to spend my time trekking through the desert and exploring old ruins and in the evenings talking about it with others while enjoying a scotch and good cigar. I look up to similar type men especially of the Victorian Era like Ernest Shackleton, Theodore Roosevelt, T.E. Lawrence, etc. I enjoy reading of their adventures and discoveries as well as their mindsets to accomplish the great things they did. I have been interested in Stoicism going on 2 years now. I truly wish I had heard of Stoicism when I was younger. I occasionally wonder how much different my life would have been if I had.I was first exposed to it through the Iron Council group in the Order of Man. Ever since my first exposure I have been very interested and am looking to expand my knowledge further. The reason I took to stoicism so quickly is that I found it matched many of my own philosophies gained over the years as well as a general love for ancient texts. With my work in the Fire Services and Iraq during the war, I have had quite an exposure to the world and the nature of man. I\'ve always looked for a way to be more disciplined and to channel my experiences without depending on them solely to come up with a "philosophy of life". My past jobs and current one are ones of heavy decision making with a requirement to be even keeled. I am not an academic. I am a field guy, and while I find academics helpful to steer me in the directions I should go I rely on experiences to get things done. I believe that everything in life is adaptable and that there is something to learn from everything we do. The first book I read on Stoicism was "A Guide to the Good Life" by William Irvine. I am currently using the Daily Stoic and its Journaling guide daily to further my studies. I have read "Meditations" by Marcus Aurelius and am currently studying 3 different translations of this work to see what more I may glean from it. I am currently working on Seneca\'s "Letters" as well. I consider myself a theist. I believe in the one God. I am a Southern Baptist Christian and have been for nearly my entire 38 years of life. Additionally, I am a member of the Ancient Free and Accepted Masons. As I live in Dubai these days I am not actively practicing but it has been a large part of my life. I have done some studying of other philosophies and religions though nothing substantial. I spend a few months studying Buddhism about 6 or 7 years ago. I was particularly interested in the Meditation and self centering techniques they employ. Other than that I have not done much active research on such matters. Frankly, my religion suits me and I have little interest in exploring others except to understand people who practice them a bit better. I do consider myself a practicing Stoic and am ready to take the next step in my journey by studying Stoicism in this manner. While I do consider myself a practicing Stoic I am not a good one. I am constantly failing and to maintain it each day has been a struggle. I have found it a worthy struggle and even my wife has commented on how I have improved since I started studying. I know that I will never be considered a "Sage" but I am aiming towards it. I think by joining this program and having a mentor and a clear path to study it will further my aims, make my study more efficient and aid my greatly on my journey. Additionally, I hope to meet other stoics. Western philosophy isn\'t very big here in Dubai and having others to learn from and talk to would be amazing. If accepted and if I earn my certificate. I intend to work through the Marcus Aurelius School with the desire of earning a place in the Black Eagle Monastery. I understand that I am beginning a long journey to obtain these goals and I look forward to the knowledge I will gain from this. Why do I hope to do this? I feel that Stoicism is a wonderful philosophy of life that will work for nearly anyone. In these days of consumerism, proud ignorance, selfishness, selfies and constant bombardment from advertisements and news I feel this is the best method of navigating it all. I want to teach others what I have learned and do my part in helping to bring Stoicism back to the forefront of life. I would love to see the gathering of men and women to discuss the philosophy of life like in the days of old. I know if we could get that to happen and get people talking face to face again, the world would be a better place. Thank you for your time and consideration.

Growing up, I found it easiest to try to apply what I learned about myself through reflecting and examining my thoughts to help understand the behavior of others. I journaled a lot, and when I wasn’t journaling, I was thinking about my thinking. Naturally, my first passion was Psychology. I chose to attend an International Baccalaureate school for high school, just so I could take a two-year Psychology elective. That decision, I believe, shaped my outlook for years to come. I found the IB program rigorous and stimulating; my courses always seem to motivate me to develop a deeper understanding of whatever I was studying. For example, in our History studies, we were encouraged to determine the personal and historical context that motivated a particular historian to interpret events the way he or she did. This is an analytical lens I found fascinating, and one I continue to use often within Psychiatry. \n\nI came to a crossroads of sorts in college: although I first chose to study Psychology, eager to continue developing an understanding of the brain, I had accumulated nearly enough credits to graduate by the end of my second year. This forced me to make a decision about my future. Although I enjoyed Psychology, I did not see myself purely as an academic or researcher. I longed for a way to practically apply my insights and skills for the benefit of others - not as a teacher, but as a healer. Although I could have chosen to become a PhD within Psychology, there was something about the medical path that drew me instead. I think a lot of it was wanting to take the role of a leader, as physicians are often compelled to do. Thus, I studied Medicine, and then Psychiatry. I have always felt comfortable in an academic setting, and although my path has been a challenging one at times, the intellectual rigor is something I crave. I also enjoy the opportunity to address my patients’ problems in the here and now; however imperfect our understanding of the brain and our treatments, I try to alleviate as much suffering as I can with the tools I have. \n\nUltimately, I have chosen to pursue a fellowship in Forensic Psychiatry starting this July. It is arguably the most outrightly philosophical branches of Psychiatry, likely due to its close relationship with the law. To understand Forensic Psychiatry, you have to understand something of the History of Psychiatry, which is a natural fit for me due to my personal interests in History. But it also forces you to appreciate the unique position of being an expert, a steward of your knowledge, and an evaluator without a formal treatment relationship to the patient. This unique role forces Forensic Psychiatrists to grapple with practical ethics and our professional commitment to ethical ideals such as respect for persons, honesty, justice, and social responsibility. These are ideals I do not take lightly personally or professionally. \n\nAlthough I have found my career choice incredibly fulfilling, I have long been aware that something has been missing. Although I enjoy finding meaning in my work, it is not enough to fully enrich my life (nor should it be), and I have felt directionless and at times, a little empty. I have attempted to remedy this by learning more about Buddhism. Although baptized into the Catholic Church, I left organized religion in my teenage years; it never felt natural to me, and the more I learned about evolution, the less interested I was in the idea of a higher power. (Currently, I see myself as more agnostic than anything else.) Yet I have long been aware that there is a side of myself that seeks a personal sense of purpose and clarity, if not through organized religion, than through some other avenue. Just as I strive to better myself professionally, I want to do the same personally. I thought that Buddhism might serve as a solution. Although I still enjoy the benefits of meditation, every time I attempted to engage with Buddhist philosophy, there was something inscrutable about it that gave me pause. I ended up feeling like I wanted it to be a better fit for me than it was. \n\nRecently, I encountered Stoicism through reading “How to Think Like a Roman Emperor,” by Donald Robertson. I felt that Robertson, a psychotherapist, would be an ideal person to introduce me, as we already speak a similar language professionally. In Stoicism, I realize that I am finding that sense of clarity that has eluded me in other attempts to find meaning and direction in life. It echoes a lot of the professional commitments I have already made as a future Forensic Psychiatrist, while allowing me to develop within myself personally. I have also been reading a “Beginner’s Guide to Stoicism” to complement Robertson’s book. That being said, I have a desire to move beyond introductory texts to the source material itself, but I want to do so in the most meaningful way possible, ideally with a sense of structure. \n\nI know that I cannot move forward alone. I have benefited from many mentors professionally in the past, and I carry forward their knowledge and wisdom in my own practice. To try to learn Medicine or Psychiatry without the assistance of mentors would be foolhardy and likely impossible. Likewise, if I want to learn to be a Stoic, I feel that some form of mentorship is essential. I do not yet call myself a Stoic, as I do not feel I have studied enough, but I would like to use this course to continue my studies and efforts to become one. More than that, I would like to use Stoic philosophy to become the best, wisest version of myself. I believe that in continuing to engage with Stoic philosophy, my future personal and professional commitments would continue to become clearer, and I would engage more richly and effectively in my life. I could not make a better commitment or ask for a better reward than this. ', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, '', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', 0, 0, '', '');

I am a 41 year old husband, father, hobby farmer, and recovering alcoholic with over 11 years of continuous sobriety. In addition to physical exercise, I enjoy learning about Stoicism and the challenges it presents.  I am convinced that The College of Stoic Philosophers will offer the knowledge and fulfillment that I am searching for. It took me a long time to settle into the roles described here, so I will begin with my background and the events that led me here.\n\nUpbringing and Early Trouble\nI was raised in the suburbs of Dallas, Texas mostly by a single mother with one brother and one sister, both older. My dad left the family when I was 1.  His character defects and manner of abandonment would come back to haunt me on what was already the worst night of my life. I did have a stepfather from the ages 5 through 10, and he taught me some of the basics, like how to shake a man\'s hand, shoot a basketball, and tie a fishing line, just to name a few. I would come to appreciate this, but not for a very long time.  \nOnce my Mom became single again, she was forced to work to support us.  I was without a father figure in my life, and my mom was no longer home as much.  I leaned on my older brother and coaches to fill the masculine role in my life. My brother and I are incredibly close now, but back then, we already began mapping out different paths for ourselves.\nAs a teenager, I always wanted to be popular and make people laugh.  I was more than happy to get into trouble and act out of line on my quest to be in the spotlight. I was a bit of a show off and could be easily influenced to do things I knew were wrong. Thus, I began to drink and party in high school more and more.  My saving grace was that I had very good grades in school so my Mom had no reason to worry.\n As soon as I graduated, I was off to Lubbock to attend Texas Tech, a known party school, with no clue what I was going to do.  I was just ready to be on my own, but I was way too immature. I basically majored in drinking with a minor in gambling.  I was sent home a year later, a failure that didn’t phase me.  I just figured I was free to party in Dallas again.\n\nMy 20s:  Bars, Alcohol, and Several Hard Knocks\nI was now back in Dallas, reuniting with old friends who never left, and working in bars and restaurants. Work, drink, repeat. That was my routine. I was never opposed to working hard; in fact, at that time I juggled three jobs. My work ethic was and has always remained strong, a trait I inherited from my mother.\nI settled into a management position working for “two brothers-slash-bar owners” where I would stay for the next 10 years.  I enjoyed bartending and being back in the spotlight, and the atmosphere was also a good place for me to hide my growing drinking problem. I wrecked my truck and accumulated a DWI before I was even legally old enough to drink. I guess I knew at the time that I was not drinking like a normal person, but was too afraid to correct it.  \nToday as I reflect upon this period of my life, I am baffled and ashamed at my serious lack of maturity. My joke is that I was 21 years old for a solid decade. My twenties were spent in a fast paced bar, living like a fake rock star. As my drinking became  more unmanageable, the cracks in my character and personal life began to show.\n\nMy Series of Rock-Bottoms\nIn my late twenties I was still working for the same bar as the manager, but was in a relationship so it appeared I had settled down a bit. My girlfriend brought out the good in me and I remember overhearing my mom thanking her for “bringing my Max back”. Our relationship was good, and I felt I was in love. The sad part was that our relationship was really just masking the fact that I was an alcoholic. I did not drink as much as I used to because of her, but would still have all-night binges when given the opportunity. I would pick a fight just so I would have an excuse to go out and tie one on. \nRock bottom may sound like a single instant or event, but mine was more like a series of blackouts, police officers, courtrooms, and abandonment that lasted about 6 months. It started with a night of drinking at a bar with my girlfriend and friends. As usual, I did not drink much more than the others sitting at our table, but I had a secret side tab going with the bartender. I always knew the bartender at the places we went to, so I would sneak off to the bathroom and do shots with them while my girl was not looking. By the end of the night I was in a full blackout, so I do not remember anything that transpired once we got home.\nApparently, I picked a fight with her over a burrito, and, while trying to take it from her, I pushed her into the door frame where she cut her eye open. I had done the unthinkable and put my hands on my girlfriend. \nThe next thing I remember was the blood rushing down my arms, the cops pounding on my door, and me hiding in my closet. The cops would later come back and let themselves in to find me and take me away. Later I learned that after the fight, she left and walked to my mom’s house a mile away because she did not have a family of her own nearby. The police saw her and came to our place looking for me.  What they discovered was that I had attempted suicide by taking knives to my arms. During the midst of  this turmoil, I found a phone number for my real father that I had been storing for years and dialed him up.  After a lifetime of silencing my feelings, on this particular night, I called him.  Nothing like a blackout drunk phone call to my estranged father after an attempted suicide. \nThis was the last time I saw my girlfriend for a while. She did not want to see or communicate with me. We spoke only through my mom. She was in school at the time, but she wanted to go home to her family in New Mexico, but I insisted she keep our apartment and stay until her semester ended. I packed up some clothes and stayed with my mom until her school semester ended. \nMy Dad left when I was 1, my now ex-girlfriend moved on, and so I fell back into work, drink, repeat. The blackouts were more and more and in another blackout, I attempted driving again. Same result as 10 years before. I totaled my Jeep and was on DWI number two. God was sending me the signals but I was still not listening. Luckily I was only doing damage to myself. \nI kept going on not considering I needed help until a day before my first court date. This day happened to be my Fantasy Football draft day in 2008. I spent the day with my boys hanging out and day drinking. The day carried into night and next thing I know I was waking up trying to put the pieces together. I contacted my friends that I was with because I could not find my wallet. I was expecting the usual “you were so wasted” stories that I had always heard but this time was different. My friends did not even realize how drunk I was or that I was in a blackout majority of the night. I was expecting the worst but apparently acted like a gentleman all night. This baffled me. Now I was blacking out without acting out. I gathered my confusing thoughts and headed to court to meet my lawyer. I was not too concerned with the court because my lawyer explained that I just needed to show up and we were going to move it to a later date. I guess I did not take into account the fact that I reeked of alcohol. My lawyer let me know and it finally hit me. I had a problem. I surrendered that day. \n\nI Finally Surrendered\nThere happened to be a lady at the courthouse who ran an addiction center. My lawyer knew her and introduced us. I rode with her to her facility and gave my testimony. I was defeated. I was a 30-year old child with an alcohol problem. I called my mom to meet me and signed up for an outpatient program. This was the first day of my sobriety almost 11 years ago. Sobriety date August 25th, 2008. \nSobriety was a struggle at first but got easier. As I was retraining myself to get through life without alcohol, I was beginning to finally mature. I was seeing the world differently and with clearer eyes. I took my sobriety so seriously. It clicked with me from the start and I attended my outpatient classes regularly. I let my bosses know I was done with drinking. They appeared to support my decision and it did not change my role as Manager of their bar. \nThe thing that was changing was me. I began to care for myself. I developed new healthy habits and was maturing more and more. The bar life lost is appeal. In a weird way, working at the bar early in my sobriety actually helped me.  Right in front of me on a nightly basis I could see the type of person I did not want to be anymore . \nI kept to myself a lot at this time. I started eating cleaner, exercising, and living a more straight-edge life. My dad, who I was now beginning a new relationship with, gave me a dog and she kept me busy. As I lost interest in working late nights and dealing with drunks, I looked for a change. I decided to move to Louisiana. My brother had moved there years before and was married and raising his girls. My dad was there and I thought it would help our new relationship. I really had nothing to lose.\n\nRole Swap\nI was now in my mid 30’s and living in Lafayette, Louisiana. Nobody knew my past here and it felt like I was starting fresh, so I began dating. After a few unsuccessful dates, I hit the jackpot when I met Fran. She was incredible and my perfect match! We are both animal lovers with similar backgrounds and common values.  We married after two years and settled in on the small homestead that Fran had established on the backside of her family’s land. My life began coming together with the formation of my own little family.  Fran already had a son so I became a step-father.  Two years later Fran gave birth to our daughter.  \nThese years between 2015 and 2017 brought tons of changes to my life.  I went back to school and changed careers in search of a more traditional work schedule where I could enjoy weekends off with the family. In addition to marriage, moving to the country with Fran, becoming a father and step-father, going back to school, switching not just jobs, but switching fields, I also underwent a medical procedure, buried my beloved companion dog Elli, and discovered that my dad had been diagnosed with terminal cancer.  He was given 3 months to live, and I dedicated myself to being there for him.  His funeral service was held the evening of my first day at my new job.  I attended work, where I was determined to make a good first impression.  In the evenings I mourned my dad’s passing.  I continued practicing a life of sobriety and stayed focused on what would lie ahead.\nI continued to work on myself;  it often felt like I was making up for lost time. I started reading, a skill I feel I have not yet mastered due to a lifetime of fast-paced living and habits. I also started to listen to podcasts and absorb different avenues of self-improvement. I worked with an old Cajun ex-alcoholic and he took me through the 12 steps of Alcoholics Anonymous, a process designed to bring about a spiritual awakening.  I also attended meetings to meet others in recovery.  My desire to drink had been removed years ago, but these experiences were uncomfortable, which was just what I was looking for!  I became interested in growth through adversity and discomfort, such as ice-cold showers, meditation, sleeping outdoors, Jiu Jitsu and disconnecting from the phone and internet.  About 3 years ago I became intrigued with the concept of Stoicism after hearing it referenced again and again by nearly all of my favorite influencers and mentors.\n\nWhat is Stoicism?\nEvery A.A. meeting begins with the Serenity Prayer:\nGod grant me the serenity \nTo accept the things I cannot change; \nCourage to change the things I can; \nAnd wisdom to know the difference.\nI said this Prayer over and over. I understood what it was saying but never really applied to everything in my life. For example, my Mom showed me how important a strong work ethic is, but she also showed me how to worry. She worries about everything and so do I. Past and future are on my mind no matter how many times I tell myself to accept the things I cannot change.One day I went down an internet rabbit hole looking at the origins of the Prayer hoping to find more meaning and a way to actually apply what it was saying to my own life. A lot of searches and discussions led to Stoic Philosophy.  \nAnother way Stoicism came in my life was through Ryan Holiday. I was listening to podcasts regularly, mostly Joe Rogan but would spin off onto guests of his that I found interesting. I believe I first heard an interview with Ryan on the Aubrey Marcus podcast and they were discussing Ego is the Enemy. I was so intrigued by the idea of killing my ego I read Ryan’s book in its entirety, which is a small miracle in itself. I enjoyed the style of the book and read his other book Obstacle is the Way. So there was this Stoicism thing again! The references in the books led me to look up who Marcus Aurelius really was and other famous Stoics. \nA lot of the podcasts and blogs that I follow seem to have some sort of link to Stoicism. The Art of Manliness blog and podcast has several references to Stoicism. I enjoy Tim Ferriss’s content and writings, and Jocko Willink is another podcaster I love to listen to. Although I tend to skip a lot of Jocko’s military themed shows, I do like the message that he delivers. His speech title Good is one of my favorites and something I try to keep fresh on my mind. I do not believe that Jocko ever references or uses the word Stoicism but similar concepts are repeated. Stoicism of Fire is one of the Stoicism-based podcasts I like and is where I found the College of Stoic Philosophers. \n\nI own a copy of Meditations, Gregory Hays translation, which I haven’t completed yet, and I receive the Donald Robertson emails about each section of Meditations. I have them archived so I am going back and reading each book along with his commentary. I read the Daily Stoic as well. \nReading comprehension is difficult for me; once I am distracted I tend to lose information. I assume this is why I gravitate more to shorter blogs and emails.  My method for improving is simply removing distraction and reading regularly. One thing that intrigues me about your school is that I know I will be held accountable for reading the required material, I know this arrangement suits my personality and will yield the greatest results. \n\nReligion, Faith, and Finding my Way.\nI grew up attending a Methodist Church with my family and I always considered myself a Christian. However, I never felt the presence of a God in my life until I got sober. To be honest, I do not know how to classify my feelings about God.  I am fascinated by Jesus and his teachings, yet struggle with believing in the miracles. Did the resurrection occur in a literal way? Or did it not?  I believe that either way, Christianity and the stories/events in the Bible changed the world for the better. I also believe in evolution, so strict interpretation of the Bible always presents its own set of challenges for me.  \nAnother aspect of my struggle is that I have always felt that we inherit our religion from our parents. Because of this, I thought it was unfair that my friends who were Jewish would never learn of Jesus because they were raised differently.  Due to differences in upbringing, they would end up in hell and I would not?  It just did not ever seem right to me, so from then on, I was to be more open-minded with the beliefs of others.\nWhat I do know is there is a Higher Power out there that I call “God”. I do not picture God as some old man in the sky type who is there to answer Prayers. I believe God is working in our lives but not as directly as we would like. I believe God is more of a force and the nature of the world around us. I like to talk to God through Prayer and be with God in meditation, a skill I began practicing over 5 years ago, yet am only beginning to learn my way. I also believe that God can be different for anybody. If your God is Jesus, or Allah, or Buddha, rock and roll, good for you.  It’s turtles all the way down the line for me!\nI feel it is important to believe in something greater than you can imagine, but not be closed off to other people\'s beliefs.I do feel like Christianity has done the most good for the world in the past 2000 years. I believe it brought more love into the world and there is nothing wrong with that. My wife and I recently discussed finding a church to attend and bring our children to. Overall the Christian way of life is what I would like my children to inherit, but as they get older I will encourage them to discover their own relationship to God.\n\nStoicism and My LIfe Today\nI mentioned I have sheep, chickens, dogs, cats, and more!  Animals are all around me all of the time.  I am fascinated by animals because they live only by God’s will. Removal of self-will and replacing it with God’s will in all aspects of my day, was the only way I got sober. I would love to live in God’s will to a greater extent today and learn to kill my ego. \n I have dealt with depression and anxiety my entire life. Alcohol is what I depended on to hide my feelings. Now that I do not have that in my life, I am depending on God, myself and healthy habits. My depression seems to capture my thoughts. When my head is not straight, I lose sight of what is important to me. While filled with dread about work and worry about my future, I get stuck in a hole and it gets harder and harder to climb out. I tried antidepressants for a while but weaned myself off. Removing one drug from my life and replacing it with another does not sit well with me. I feel like God is laying out the tools necessary for me, I just need to use them. \nI do not consider myself a Stoic , far from it.   But I am teachable and eager to learn.  The idea that I can choose the way I think and react to events or people in my life is a major attraction of Stoicism. The basic principles make sense to me--it just clicks. It describes the man that I aspire to be.  It promises a lifestyle that can both alleviate the struggles I experience and embody the man that I want my kids to look up to.\n\nMy Goals for this Course\nI would like to gain a better understanding of the foundation and application of Stoicism from your college. I have been on the fence about writing this essay for months now--maybe due to lack of discipline, maybe due to insecurities.  Most of my life has been without discipline simply because I haven’t gone after challenges and goals that require discipline.  I have discovered how necessary the act of setting goals and challenges can be for me to become the best version of myself.  This achievement serves not only myself, but allows me to be of better service to others.  Without discipline my life is one by which I am simply leaving everything up to chance, which just leads to chaos and self-defeat.  I would like to learn a new way to approach life and pick up daily habits to help me along the way. \n I know that attending (and completion) of the College of Stoic Philosophers will give me a sense of pride and accomplishment. I may have gotten a late start on life, but perhaps everything that happened was for a reason!  Understanding the reason, I suspect, will provide: the answers to my questions, silence the questions that do not serve me well, and the wisdom to know the difference.\n\nMax Miller 2/3/2020\n', 1, '2020-07-14', 1, 0, 0, '', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', 0, 0, '', ''),

I wasn\'t good at Math or any of the other disciplines.\nIn sports, it was worse, I was always the last to be chosen when the kids were playing. It didn\'t help\nthat I used to wear very thick glasses because of hypermetropia and astigmatism. \n\nMy mother was the super protective type\nalways making sure that I would not face challenges, and my father was kind of absent, \nworking something like 18 hours per day.\n\nAs a teen, my coping mechanism was to close myself to the world and \nwatch cartoons or play videogames as much as I could.\nIn my teens, my parents became more affluent since they became owners of a restaurant.\nWhen I got into high-school I was very scared of the possibility of being a shadow of \nmy father and working with him.\n\nFrom this fear, the changes started to follow. I\'ve started studying night and day to prove to my parents \nand the world, that if I dedicate myself I could\nbe approved in the most difficult college entrance exam of Brazil (Military Institute of Engineering, RJ).\n\nThis project lasted 5 years. since second-year high school until I was approved (I was 20 years old then). \nIt was the first time I\'ve met the power of not giving up on something even if you\'re bottom class.\n\nAfter so much time studying and being anxious about being rejected, I\'ve programmed myself to study in every \nhour available.\nNot the most healthy habits, but better than playing video games all the time right?.\n\nIn my third year at college, I\'ve started my first serious relationship. She was much more carefree than me.\nAnd somehow I taught her a bit about focusing on career and she taught me about having more time with friends and traveling.\n\nMy focus on work (and anxiety about it) started to grow as I was finishing college. Despite having interned at 3 companies, I was restless and paranoid,\nalways studying and with fear of not getting what I wanted in my Career. She didn\'t cope with my habits and a few weeks before my graduation she broke up with me.\n\nAt the time I was so focused on getting a job at a competitive position in a startup and with my exams, that I didn\'t feel much about it.\nAdding to this setback, the majority of my friends left Rio de Janeiro and I became (at least I\'ve had this thought) lonely in the world.\n\nAfter doing like a hundred of interviews, I was finally accepted to my top work preference to be a data scientist.\nThat eased me up. It was a social business, I was an owner of stock options and most importantly I loved the purpose of the job.\n\n4 months later, the company decided to fire every employee because it was spending too much and the investors were concerned with the performance.\nSo yeah, fired in my first real engineering job.\n\nSince I was doing my job well and was very passionate about the business. The CTO of the company invited me to be part-owner of a startup he was starting.\nThe excitement brought up again and along with it anxiety and fear.\n\nAfter the initial high, it seemed like all my past setbacks were hurting so badly for the first time. I\'ve developed a mild depression, I was super fat (93kg then, now 71 kg), feeling extremely lonely and unable even to organize my house.\n\nThen, I\'ve started seeing a therapist and trying to put a direction in my mind. After I got functional as a human being again, I\'ve started to found that the therapy sessions were not so useful,\nsince I was just telling my stories from the week and the therapist was giving me advice about them. So I\'ve started to search for more integrated and self-reliant practice.\n\nPrinciples that I could use to guide my own decisions. First I\'ve stumbled at ACT (Acceptance and Commitment Therapy). I\'ve found useful tools from it, like self-compassion (I was much more self-critical than today) \nand paying attention to our internal processes. But still, it seemed to me that something was missing.\nIt did not inspire me to use the tools until the rest of my life.\n\nAnd then I\'ve found Stoicism reading the blog of Derek Sivers. He gave a 10/10 rating to A Guide to the Good Life from Bill Irvine.\nBefore buying it I\'ve researched blogs and reviews and read a few introductory videos. I then decided to buy and read How to Be a Stoic from Massimo Pigliucci.\n\nSince then I was completely hooked. I\'ve read a bit about other philosophies and approaches, but Stoicism seems to me like the most cohesive and in accordance with my values.\n\nFrom the classics the only one that I\'ve read is Epictetus. And I\'ve loved it. I think I\'ve read it 3 times.\n\nI still think other philosophies (especially Buddhism because of meditation) and self-help approaches have something to offer.\nBut I think that having a main source of direction is important so that we do not confuse ourselves. I would call myself an agnostic and I am not part of any religious faith.\n\nI definitely do not consider myself a Stoic. But I aspire to be one, despite all my shortcomings. Especially in regards to keeping my cool in the workplace and not let anxiety rid away my creativity and easiness of being.\n\nWhat I consider to be a main victory from my application of the philosophy is how I\'ve coped with setbacks after I\'ve started studying the philosophy.\nThe startup that I was building didn\'t go well and I was again in the market. But I\'ve coped with the situation really well and now I\'m in a very fullfiling job in a multinational.]\n\nMy parents broke up too and they are very distant from me now. I think I\'m dealing with this situation in a dispassionate way too.\n\nI consider myself to have a superficial understanding of the main concepts of the philosophy, and I wish to deepen my understanding.\n\nBut my main goal with the course is to develop a practice that I can use and iterate until the rest of my life.\n\nI struggle a lot with consistency in various subjects. I try to maintain a routine, workout, eat healthily and all that stuff, but I slip around some times.\n\nTo summarize, I think I\'ve overcome myself a lot in various aspects, and I\'m proud of myself for that. But as my favorite passage from Epictetus says:\n\nHow long are you going to wait before you demand the best for yourself and in no instance bypass the discriminations of reason? You have been given the principles that you ought to endorse, and you have endorsed them. What kind of teacher, then, are you still waiting for in order to refer your self-improvement to him? You are no longer a boy, but a full-grown man. If you are careless and lazy now and keep putting things off and always deferring the day after which you will attend to yourself, you will not notice that you are making no progress, but you will live and die as someone quite ordinary.\nFrom now on, then, resolve to live as a grown-up who is making progress, and make whatever you think best a law that you never set aside. And whenever you encounter anything difficult or pleasurable, or highly or lowly regarded, remember that the contest is now: you are at the Olympic Games, you cannot wait any longer, and that your progress is wrecked or preserved by a single day and a single event. That is how Socrates fulfilled himself by attending to nothing except reason in everything he encountered. And you, although you are not yet a Socrates, should live as someone who at least wants to be a Socrates.\n\nI do not want to wait anymore to focus on my progress as an aspiring Stoic, so I hope to be accepted and learn a lot from the course.', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, '', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', 0, 0, '', ''),

I always looked at Stoicism as some sort of answer, and I\'m sure I was looking for \'The Answer\' somewhere on the internet when I stumbled upon Stoicism.  \n\nI struggled a lot when I was younger. My father wasn\'t around much, and my mother had her own issues. I was left largely to my own devises. I had always wished my father handed me down a code of conduct, or a code of ethics, so I would have some sort of principles to live my life by. After getting in some legal trouble, I tried to form my own code. It was long, and not really universal, but was a solid attempt to codify the conduct I would live my life by. Over time, I shied away from my \'Contract\' and went back to living hand to mouth like a hedonist.  \n\nWith the help of a therapist as a guide, I slowly started turning my life around.  I focused on stopping feed the monster of instant gratification, and worked towards long term goals. After failing out of college a few times, I finally got it right and graduated with Honors.  Even after all this success, I still find myself looking for some sort of answer. I now am about to embark on starting my own small business. Quitting my corporate job and journeying out to the unknown and unstable was driven by looking inward and trying to see what was right for me. While looking inwards, I still felt like I was missing something.  My interest in Stoicism has been rekindled. \n\n\nAny books you read on Stoic philosophy. If any, please list them.\n\nGuide to the Good Life was my first primer into stoicism. I have reread it a few times and enjoy it each time I read it. I like the casual conversation, and the applicable mental tools that Irvine gives us. However, I find it difficult to actually believe and get use form the exercises. On one hand, negative visualization is something I use still all the time to this day. I see this as a successful adaptation of stoic believes, as well as setting expectations. The category of things in my control is a structure I have done OK with keeping in my mind. However, when I try to use the technique of seeing my position from a third persons view I get no anxiety relief. For example, I try to visualize myself from a birds eye view before I give a big presentation, and then I \'zoom\' out to see that I am just a small part of the world and this moment is largely inconsequential. I can do the exercise, but I do not get any mental benefit from doing so. I still am nervous before I present. \n\n\nStoic Serenity and Companion texts\n\nI went through Stoic Serenity while I was still in school. I appreciated the interactive concept of the book, but I did not get as much out of it as Guide to The Good life. I think that is more due to the fact that I only went through it once, and rushed to some degree through it. I have the books out to revisits it more seriously. \n\nWould you call yourself an atheist, agnostic/skeptic, deist, theist?\n\nDeist, if not leaning more towards something more theist as of late. I can see the world as extremely structured, so much so that I find it hard to believe some sort of creator wasn\'t involved. Even if there wasn\'t, I can appreciate the traditions and organization of some faiths. \n\nAre you a member of a religious faith? If so, which and for how long?\nI was confirmed Catholic, went through the schools and education but never felt the pull towards the faith. I lead church retreats for mostly a social purpose. I never really got much out of the retreats outside of a social circle. \n\nHave you studied philosophies other than Stoicism? If so, which?\n\nI practiced Buddhism for a little. I enjoyed reading the texts and the meditations. I found some peace when practicing meditation regularly and for extended periods of time. I enjoy the ability to not react to things happening around me and the sense of calm I hand in my mind. I practiced metta meditation as well, and found a level of genuine empathy I never found before. I intend to revisit, but have been delaying.  I find when I resume mediation after stopping for some time, there is a lot of emotional work that needs to be done on the mat before the benefits come. I think I am delaying now due to that. \n\nDo you consider yourself to be a Stoic?\n\nNot yet, but I want to continue to strive to being one. In the same way even though I practiced Buddhism, I didn\'t define myself truly as a Buddhist.  The same applies to Stoicism, I don\'t feel I embody the traits and qualities someone who was a Stoic would have. I hope that with the practice of this course I will redefine myself as one. \n\nWhat you want to get from this course.\n\nI want to solidify a core operating structure into myself. I want to move from being principle-less towards having core values and core principles to act upon. I\'ve always felt like I haven\'t had a core conduct to operate from, and I am hoping that stoicism at least helps me fill a portion of that gap.  The practices I defined earlier when describing Guide to the Good Life are abilities I want to embody more wholly into my thoughts.  I understand and hope there are others and even more for me to gain from this course.  I’m hoping to find some more discipline in myself. I like the structure of courses for learning, and I want to be held accountable for this to some degree. I find my lack of discipline is the largest barrier for my success in life currently. \n', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, '', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', 0, 0, '', ''),

To that end, I will try to be as honest and put forth a sincere effort throughout the process.\n\nBASICS: I was born and raised in Riverside, California (about 50 miles east of Los Angeles). My father was a pastor at a Presbyterian church and so I was raised among Christians with different degrees of commitment to Christianity. I was baptized but never confirmed. I was not particularly excited about the Sunday service, but I was very active with the youth group activities. I really enjoyed the community aspect of the church and stayed involved until 2005, when I started college. \n\nINTRODUCTION TO PHILOSOPHY: My first encounter with philosophy took the form of an introductory course at Riverside Community College. I still remember the first lesson in that class; I immediately became hooked and continued to take all the philosophy courses my community college offered while taking my math and science prerequisites. In Spring 2009, I transferred to UC Berkeley and pursued a degree in mechanical engineering… while taking courses in philosophy. It soon dawned on me that I wanted to dedicate myself to philosophy. I voluntarily withdrew from UC Berkeley before the Spring 2010 semester and ultimately entered a philosophy program in Spring 2011. In the interim, I audited more philosophy courses at UC Berkeley, participated in community service clubs on campus, and met my partner, Virginia. Things moved quickly when I was finally on track: I received my B.A. in “Philosophy and Religion” from San Francisco State University by December 2012; continued in the same department and received my M.A. in Philosophy by May 2016; and got hired as a lecturer both at SFSU and CSU Northridge by August. I’ve been teaching my philosophy ever since.\n\nINTRODUCTION TO STOICISM: I distinctly remember becoming fascinated with Stoic philosophy in the Fall 2013 semester when I started my Masters program at SFSU. I finally got around to taking a survey course in Ancient Philosophy (PHIL 301) and we spent two whole days on Stoicism before moving on to Epicureanism. Luckily, my professor supplemented the main textbook with readings from Pierre Hadot’s What is Ancient Philosophy (1995). I devoured the book and quickly read Hadot’s collection of essays, Philosophy as a Way of Life (1981), and privately adopted this approach – philosophy as a way-of-life – to my studies on the topic at SFSU.\n\nREADINGS OF ANCIENT TEXTS: I read Marcus Aurelius’s Meditations, Epictetus’s Enchiridion, Musonius Rufus’s Lectures and Sayings, some of Seneca’s Essays (On the Shortness of Life, On the Happy Life, On Anger, On Leisure, On Tranquility of Mind, and his Consolation to Helvia), and some of Seneca’s Letters to Lucilius (mostly from Penguin’s Letters from a Stoic). Lastly, I was recently able to read the collection of fragments of the early Greek Stoics in The Stoic Reader (2008) by Inwood and Gerson (supplemented by Long and Sedley’s translation and commentary). I read Epictetus’s Discourses, but not at the degree of care that I’d like. I would very much like to read through all of Seneca’s Letters since I consider Seneca my favorite Stoic writer.\n\nREADINGS OF MODERN TEXTS: As I mentioned, I read works early on that provided a really helpful treatment of Stoicism as a way-of-life: Pierre Hadot’s What is Ancient Philosophy?, his Philosophy as a Way of Life, Julia Annas’s Morality of Happiness, her Intelligent Virtue, and a couple relevant chapters from Margaret Nussbaum’s Therapy of Desire. I also read John Sellar’s Stoicism and Tad Brennan’s The Stoic Life. Also with my Stoic group, I read through Massimo Pigliucci’s How to be a Stoic and Donald Robertson’s How to Think Like a Roman Emperor. We are currently going through Margaret Graver’s Stoicism and Emotion as well as Lopez & Pigliucci’s Handbook for New Stoics. Alas, Pierre Hadot’s Inner Citadel has been sitting on my bookshelf unread for many years – I plan to read that soon with or without my Stoic Group.I would also like to read through Lawrence Becker’s revised edition of A New Stoicism.\n\nRELIGIOUS BELIEFS: I am not affiliated with any religious organization/institution. I do not consider myself an atheist nor an agnostic (though that may be the prudent position given my lack of experience with the divine). If I have a choice, I would like to consider myself a monist or pantheist. This is because the few times when I have had experiences that could be described as religious were those in nature and so the Stoic (Spinozan?) notion of ‘God as Nature’ makes sense to me. In no way would I ascribe anthropomorphic attributions to God except with metaphors for the purpose of articulating one’s religious experiences. Though I have much in the way of internalizing this sensible conception of God, I cautiously consider myself religious.\n\nRELIGIOUS AFFILIATIONS: As I said, I am not affiliated with any religious organization. That being said, I was a Presbyterian for my formative years (from my birth until around 2005) and my appreciation for institutionalized religion only grew as I progressed through my ‘philosophy and religion’ undergraduate program in San Francisco.\n\nSTUDY OF OTHER PHILOSOPHIES: I received my B.A. and M.A. in philosophy; my focus was metaethics, moral psychology, virtue ethics, and general ethics. I read many of the standard texts: Augustus, Aquinas, Descartes, Berkeley, Hume, Kant, Hegel, Kierkegaard, Nietzsche, Husserl, Heidegger, Sartre/Beauvoir. I enjoyed Plato and Aristotle; I enjoyed Daoist, Confucian, Buddhist, and Neo-Confucian texts (my thesis adviser was a specialist in Neo-Confucian philosophy). I also spent a few years studying Sanskrit and reading Hindu philosophy at UC Berkeley as a graduate student.\n\nI currently teach as a lecturer in philosophy at CSU Northridge and SFSU (online). So, as I teach introductory courses, I often return to the Platonic dialogues, Aristotle’s Nicomachean Ethics, early Buddhist sutras, the Analects, Mengzi, Zhuangzi and more contemporary works in virtue ethics. I also teach classes on contemporary moral issues (applied ethics), the philosophy of pop culture, and business ethics. This last course is to accommodate the large business college at CSUN and I often try to include as much virtue ethics as I can!\n\nSTOIC IDENTITY: I do consider myself a Stoic and I don’t think I have to qualify that label. For the first time since I left the church, I feel like I can encapsulate my worldview accurately and identify myself with a larger community of people. Since I consider myself a Stoic, I’d like to think I will take the coursework of the College of Stoic Philosophers and my mentorship very seriously.\n\nCOURSE EXPECTATIONS: I want to learn. As a lifelong academic, I enjoy a structured and guided learning experience and so I thought that this would be helpful. I also want to move on to the Marcus Aurelius School and learn how to better teach/share the insights of Stoicism to my community. I am the founder and main facilitator of the Los Angeles Stoics and I’m always looking for ways in which I can grow into that role.', 1, '2020-07-14', 1, 0, 0, '', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', 0, 0, '', ''),

I am currently considered 100% disabled by the Department of Veterans Affairs, and am a \'stay-at-home-dad\'.  I volunteer time with the Civil Air Patrol, along with my 14 year old son.\n\n	I first became interested in Stoicism before I knew what Stoicism was.  I had always identified as an idealist and a moral absolutist, and found it very difficult to identify with people who were moral relativists or who sought no higher guiding principals.  I was drawn to the ethos of the samurai and the writings of Marcus Aurelius, I purchased a copy of a book that had writings from Seneca, Marcus Aurelius, and, I believe, The Golden Sayings of Epictetus – though I cant locate it at the moment – some years ago, and found that I identified greatly with the philosophy that it expounded.  I was especially taken with how history remembers Marcus Aurelius, as one of the Five Good Emperors.  That such a philosophy should assist one of the most powerful men of his age to go down in history, relatively speaking to the countless other emperors, as “Good”, seemed significant, to say the least.  I\'ve studied all of the major and most of the minor religions of history, but have had issues with the dogma and lack of reason in many.  I studied Soto Zen Buddhism for many years and was almost ordained, but the “sitting meditation as its own fulfillment” part and not seeking to project that alleged “enlightenment” into the world at large seemed cold and self possessive. \n\n	I have studied philosophy, in general, as well as metaphysics.  My favorites would have to be Porphyry, Iamblichus, and Pythagoras.   These three seemed to have the greatest grasp on trying to define the mechanism of metaphysical thought.  I have also found an interest in history and the Mystery Religions of the ancient East, as they tried to weave both religious thought together with scientific fact and inquiry, something which I think is sorely missing in today\'s \'theologians\', and to be honest, the separation of those two disciplines has always perplexed me.  In my estimation, whatever the divinity may be, we were gifted from him with the capacity to reason and question, and only by following the logical progression of thought and applying absolute principals and ethics to our actions, can we hope to live a \'righteous\' life.  And that should be enough to be its own reward, the knowledge that one acted with rectitude and honor without the hope of moral desert.  Perhaps presenting an example for the right treatment of one another while doing so, would allow others to see that such a life would be possible, and treat their fellow man with dignity and respect without having to create dogmatic separations.\n\n	If I had to define myself along a religious line, I might be inclined to identify as a deist.  As a Freemason, and with the evidence I see around me in the natural world, I believe in a Supreme Being, and some form of Intelligent Design, but to what degree or purpose is clearly beyond me.  I find that the overarching tenets of Buddhism are more reasonable than many of the second-hand dogmas of traditional organized religion, simply because they teach a spiritual empathy for all humanity and the recognition that change must begin with oneself before it can hope to be brought out in the world, and because Buddha was supposedly quoted as having been very much in favor of questioning things and only believing in a doctrine once it had passed the test of reason.  It was more out of a search for some immutable and undiluted truth that I began investigating religion, and thereby saw the similarities in many of the extant traditions.  This led me to believe that it was an ingrained notion that separated \'right\' from \'wrong\' and \'good\' from \'bad\', and that the decay in the human condition was therefore bound with a changing and flexible morality and ethics.  It only remained to find the moral and ethical system that seemed most reasonable and equitable, and that would seem to be Stoicism.\n\n	As to what I hope to get out of the course, I\'d first and foremost like a deeper understanding of the philosophy.  Though I have read and very briefly studied it, and what I have read seems to support my instinctual understanding of morality and ethics, I\'d like to explore the nuances of it and see by what means I might incorporate it into my daily life.  And, as I said earlier, I was impressed with the longevity of Marcus Aurelius\' name and reputation.  While I would still work to behave and act in such a way that I can be satisfied with my conduct and the way in which I treated others, without regard to ego, I wouldn\'t be adverse to leaving a legacy that my children could look at and be proud of.  Throughout history, there have been men and women whose names have stood the test of time.  Marcus Aurelius, Leonidas, George Washington, Saigo Takemori, the 47 Ronin, Joan of Arc, and so forth.  The commonality of these men and women is that they represent behaviors and ideals that we would like to see in ourselves, and so in taking their examples – we emulate them.  I would be at peace to know that the example I left behind for my progeny was one of conviction to a set of moral and ethical principals that did not waiver or shake with peer pressure or public opinion.  That \'Right\' was \'Right\' and would remain so, as long as you had put in the requisite time, work, and thought to ensure it was right and not simply self-endorsing.\n\n	I suppose, based on that, I would consider myself a Stoic, though not nearly well enough versed to consider myself a philosopher in the discipline.', 1, '2020-07-01', 0, 0, 0, '', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', 0, 0, '', '');

Not sure the first one was received.', 'My name is Chris, I\'m 41 years old and currently live in Dallas, Tx. I was born in St. Louis Missouri in 1978. I had a good childhood, with one brother a couple of years younger than me to pal around with and just be kids.  We moved a few times, to Fort Lauderdale, Cleveland, and ultimately ended up in Dallas just prior to my freshman year of college. I graduated from college, earning my Bachelors of Science in Marketing. \n\nI have a 10 year old daughter via my first marriage, and have since married again and have a 12 year old step son.  I learned a lot from my first failed marriage - mainly that it is a journey and not a destination, and that it requires constant work to keep the relationship strong.  We\'ve been happily married for 5 years and I consider my wife to be my best friend. \n\nI have been working in eCommerce/Digital my entire career, and currently am a Senior Manager of a Digital team at a large telecommunications company.  Work life balance is important to me, and I try very hard to put my best foot forward during work hours, and then completely unplug once work is over to focus on personal/family time. \n\nPersonality wise, I would describe myself as an introvert.  I am not one that has a lot of friends, instead preferring to keep my circle small and tight, mostly limited to family with a couple of close friends I confide in. Those closest to me call me stubborn, pensive, and fiercely loyal. I would describe myself as a private person, choosing not to air details of my personal life to acquaintances. Socializing in large groups is not something I prefer, and is tiresome to me, mostly because I don\'t value superficial small talk and would prefer to have meaningful conversations with those close to me instead. This has gotten better over the years as I\'ve learned to handle small talk situations through work functions and gatherings I attend with my wife. However it\'s not a natural tendency for me and always feels somewhat forced. \n\nSix and a half years ago I became very ill, which resulted in my kidneys failing.  I had been on dialysis for the past 6.5 years, doing treatments 5 days a week at home during work hours to lessen the impact on my life. It\'s been difficult at times, having a chronic illness, and the anxiety and stress that results from thoughts about what this means for my life long term has been a struggle. I recently had a transplant and am now navigating through those changes, with the RX regimen and the new rules I have to live by to protect my new kidney and keep it healthy. \n\nAs I mentioned, my health has been a struggle for me mentally, with thoughts of "what-if" and worry about what might happen dominating my thoughts at times.  It is this struggle that ultimately led me to start searching for a way to cope around 6 months ago. I am not a religious person, unlike my wife, who is a Methodist and grew up in a very religious family. So religion was not the answer for me.  Interestingly enough, I attended private Christian schools my entire life, but something never seemed right with that belief system and I never embraced it. It didn\'t seem practical to me and there were too many assumptions and blind leaps of faith required.  I wouldn\'t call myself an atheist - I think it is possible and maybe probable that some higher power exists, but I don\'t feel like we can fully understand or really know. So I guess the best way to describe myself would be agnostic. \n\nI am also not one that likes to discuss my issues with strangers (psychologists, etc.), being an introvert, so I set out to find something that I could adopt to change the way I perceive things and hopefully improve myself mentally and find a sense of peace with my situation. This search ultimately led me to Stoicism. \n\nSo far I\'ve been reading though Epictetus\'s Discourses and Enchiridion, and Marcus Aurelius\'s Meditations.  Reading the Meditations for the first time was like a lightning bolt for me. The concepts of the shortness of life, accepting the course of nature, and harnessing the power of our perceptions all resonated strongly with me, and I felt like it was something that I could actually adopt and apply to my life to help work towards inner peace.  I\'ve also read "Happy" by Darren Brown, which I thought was a good book based on many Stoic principles, and provided some guidance on practical ways to put Stoicism into action in our daily lives. I\'ve also begun reading Donald Robertson\'s "How to think like a Roman Emperor", to delve further into Stoicism but also to learn more about Marcus Aurelius.  I find him to be a fascinating historical figure so far, and am interested in learning more about the man and his life. \n\nI haven\'t studied much philosophy outside of high school and college, which was a long time ago.  Darren Brown\'s "Happy" did have chapters that provided some historical context to the rise of Stoicism, touching on Aristotle, Socrates, Plato, the Cynics, and Epicurus. \n\nI do not consider myself a Stoic currently as I don\'t fully understand everything I have read thus far.  I only know that I have found something that makes sense to me, and I feel a strong pull to learn more.  That feeling doesn\'t happen to me often, so when it does I pay attention to it. \n\nWhat I\'m looking for from this course is some structure and guidance to help me in my study of Stoicism philosophy and underlying principles, and how I can adopt and apply them in a practical way in my everyday life. Right now I am reading and researching as much as I can, but it feels unstructured and I don\'t feel like I\'m making much progress. I don\'t consider this course a shortcut by any means, and I know this is only the start of a lifelong journey to learn and implement Stoic philosophy as a way of life.\n\n', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, '', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', 0, 0, '', ''),

I was born and raised in a non-religious family and received a purely secular education, centred on critical thinking and skepticism. Despite my atheistic upbringing, I have always been deeply inquisitive, attracted to both philosophy and spirituality. I received a French education, which includes the study of basic philosophy from high school.  Philosophy became my favourite subject, and this is when I first encountered the great thinkers of Western civilization. Unfortunately, high school philosophy is purely theoretical. The aim of the subject was knowledge, and not practical wisdom that whose aim was to enable students to lead a virtuous and meaningful life, which is supposed to be the goal of philosophy. \n\nI went on to study Linguistics at University in the UK, and I have recently completed a Masters in applied Linguistics and TEFL, after several years experience as an English and French language teacher in various schools and institutions around the world. Haunted and often tormented by life\'s \'\'big questions\'\' , I saught answers in various forms of spirituality. Despite my secular upbringing and education, I have never been able to call myself an atheist. I have often struggled with faith, and often experienced existential crises, yet I continued trying to find answers in spirituality. As a result, I explored both the monotheistic religions and the eastern Dharmic religions, including Theravada Buddhism and Hindu Vedanta. \n\nI have also been associated with the ancient Persian philosophy of Zoroastrianism for a number of years, which I admire because of its primary focus on morality and living the virtuous life. According to Zoroastrianism, virtue/morality is the greatest good, and living according to righteousness should be the primary goal of one\'s life. The central tenet of Zoroastrianism is summarized in the short yet central Ashem Vohu prayer : \'\'righteousness/virtue is the best good, it leads to radiant happiness/bliss/satisfaction. Bliss is for the person who is righteous for the sake of  the best righteousness/virtue alone\'\'. \n\nThis deeply impressed me, because most of the other known religious traditions (especially monotheistic) teach that the goal of righteousness should be to attain Paradise or Heaven. This had always seemed rather hypocritical to me. For this reason, I have never felt comfortable with any of the Abrahamic faiths. Other problems I have with these traditions include blind faith, ignoring scientific evidence, and the belief in the concept of eternal damnation for unbelievers, free thinkers and skeptics. This I could never accept. I also have problems with dogmatic thinking, and was never able to reconcile religion with scientific evidence (such as evolution, or the age of the Universe). \n\nI have also been able find a lot of meaning in Buddhism, particularly Theravada Buddhism, which did make a lot of sense to me, yet it all seemed very (culturally) alien at the same time. As a Westerner, I was never fully accepted in the cultural traditions of either the Buddhists or the Persian Zoroastrians (who do not traditionally accept converts). Western Buddhist groups, on the other hand, were always a little too \'\'new age\'\' and mystical to my taste. \n\nI was therefore desperately trying to find purpose and meaning in my life...rather unsuccesfully. I was seeking direction, discipline and proper guidance. Constantly wrestling with my faith and beliefs, seeking something that made sense to me and to which I could fully dedicate myself to, a spiritual path, a philosophy that would give me a sense of purpose. I could not accept a traditional religion, because this meant that I would be intellectually dishonest with myself, and I had no desire to be a hypocrite. Nor could I ever be content with simply being an Atheist because I cannot deny a certain mystery in existence. In my view, many of the modern so-called \'\'new\'\' Atheists have a very reductionist view of the Universe which I cannot accept. I am certainly not an anti-theist, as I do recognize the need that humans have for religion: faith provides us with comfort, hope, meaning, a cosmic purpose and community. Yet I was simply unable to believe in any of them. I tried to make the famous Kierkegaardian leap of faith, but was never successful. \n\n Deep down, I suppose that I would consider myself an Agnostic, a skeptic, but I had always been drawn to the idea of Pantheism. I had always believed that Existence itself, Nature, the Cosmos, could be regarded as Divine. This belief satisfies both my limited intellectual understanding of the natural world, and my search for meaning in life. The problem is that this belief alone doesn\'t offer the other things that we need to be human: a certain way of life, a lived tradition, a discipline, a community. All these things are equally important to me. \n\nRemembering my high school philosophy lessons, I decided to look back to the famous philosophers that I had first (and briefly) encountered as a teenager. Although I had always been interested in Spinozan Pantheism as a rational and philosophical yet poetic way of explaining reality, I was more attracted to the ancient Greeks. Partly because ancient Greek philosophy is the foundation of modern Western philosophy, partly because I had always been fascinated by the ancient world. I learned about Epicurianism, Cynicism and I eventually discovered Stoicism. This particular philosophy made sense to me, the concept of Logos matched my own spiritual views, and I decided to delve deeper into it. \n\nI began reading about Stoicism, watching videos on Youtube, and I realized that I had discovered an incredibly practical philosophy, especially powerful for people facing existential problems like myself. In Stoicism, I recognized what I liked the most about Buddhism, I also recognized my (culturally) Hellenistic roots, as well as rationality interwoven with a pantheistic or deistic spirituality: a spirituality that fits my own personal beliefs and that would not force me to compromise or ignore scientific facts. I eventually read the Meditations by Marcus Aurelius and the \'\'How to be a Stoic\'\' by Massimo Pigliucci, which is full of real-life contemporary examples. I recently discovered Chris Fisher\'s Traditional Stoicism podcast, which led me to the College of Stoic Philosophers.  \n\nAlthough I have been trying to live a Stoic way of life, to transform the theoretical into practical, and to instill Stoic notions into my way of life and way of thinking, I still lack the discipline and the necessary guidance to become a serious practicing Stoic. I am neither satisfied with intellectual, theoretical Stoicism, nor am I interested in a secular Stoicism. I wish to live Stoicism on a daily basis, not only as a philosophy, but  also as a form of spirituality. I feel that this Stoic spirituality (found in the works of Epectitus, Seneca and Marcus Aurelius) is lacking in the modern secular Stoicism of Irvine and Pigliucci, and it is precisely what I am looking for and what I hope to achieve by following this course.

I have to say I finally am starting to learn what it is to “know myself”.  I’m 43 years old and up to a year ago, I didn’t know myself at all.  I felt like a lost soul.  I wasn’t using my rationality or my volition; more specifically, I didn’t understand fully the meanings of rationality and volition.  Ancient Greek and Roman histories have been a passion of mine for roughly the last 10 years.  During that time, I have consumed numerous books on Ancient Greek & Roman politics, languages, and warfare, but mainly reading books pertaining to warfare.  I stumbled upon some of Marcus Aurelius’ writings and was immediately impressed with a sense of kinship.  It felt as though he was speaking directly to me.  And it made me feel like I could understand the trials and tribulations of life he was experiencing.  I wanted to know more of what he was saying and more importantly, I wanted to feel that sensation again.  So, I began this journey to learn as much as I could about stoicism.  From that point on, I’ve immersed myself in the writings of Marcus Aurelius, Epictetus, and Seneca.  Specifically, the following:\n\n•	Epictetus – A Stoic and Socratic guide to life, by A. A. Long\n•	The Happiness Hypothesis, by Jonathan Haidt\n•	Hellenistic Philosophy, by A. A. Long (I’m halfway through)\n•	Seneca - Letters from a Stoic, by Penguin Classics \n•	Courage Under Fire, by James Stockdale\n•	How to think like a Roman Emperor, by Donald Robertson\n•	A guide to the good life, by William Irvine \n•	Marcus Aurelius – Meditations, by Gregory Hays\n•	Epictetus – The Enchiridion, by Elizabeth Carter\n•	The Inner Citadel – Pierre Hadot (I’m halfway through)\n\nA little bit about myself: born and raised in Chicago, I was brought up in the Lutheran church.  However, around the age of 14 or 15, I realized that religion did not conform to the reality I was living in.  Devoting time to praying to some supernatural deity for my salvation did not resonate with me any longer, so from that point forward I have considered myself an agnostic atheist. My highest level of formal education is high school and after that, I joined the U.S Marine Corps.  I was an enlisted Marine and I served a little over four years.  During my enlistment I served in a Special Operations Team as a Designated Marksman (Sniper).  After my service in the Marines, I self-taught myself computer networking which allowed me to get a position at AT&T as a Design Engineer for wide area computer networks. After spending several years at AT&T I obtained a position at Cisco Systems where I currently work as a Lead Solutions Architect on Data Center technologies dealing mainly with the financial industry.  I’ve been married for 15yrs…I believe its 15yrs, but I’m not sure so just don’t tell my lovely wife Sophia because it might be 16yrs. I have two children from a previous relationship, Christian and Jillian.  Christian is just getting ready to start college this year and Jillian is a free bird, just exploring life as a young person in their 20s would do. \n\nMy hobby or you could say my passion for the past 25 years has been bodybuilding.  I do enjoy other aspects of the physical fitness umbrella for example, power lifting, strongman competitions, cross-fit, and running amongst other things.  Working out is something that has been ingrained in my routine since my time in the Marine Corps.  After all these years, the gym feels like my territory. I give into it and it gives back only what I put into it. Recently however I had shoulder surgery, but this physical setback I’m enduring has allowed me to practice what I have learned through my studies of Stoicism, which has made my recovery more endurable.  Along with my hobby of body building, I consider the time I spend reading ancient Greek and Roman histories to be another hobby of mine.  Roughly ten years ago I started reading about the ancient Greeks and Romans, mainly pertaining to the military aspects of the classical antiquity time period.  I have been fascinated about the battle tactic’s used in classical antiquity from the time I spent in the Marine Corps, we briefly studied them while I was enlisted.  While I was at the bookstore on day, I picked up a book on the Spartans and after reading it, from that day forward I have been consuming as much knowledge as I can about ancient warfare.  My hobby (obsession) goes as far as me paying for a subscription to a magazine called Ancient Warfare.  Form that hobby though, I have branched off to learning Latin.  For the past eight months I have been trying to learn Latin, through a few different online resources.  I know most people consider it a dead language and a waste to time to learn, but I would like to one day read some of the classic’s in Latin.  Plus, after spending time researching the resources we have to speak and learn Latin, there are numerous web sites, Latin meet-up groups, etc.  Those places and resources give you the opportunity to practice your Latin, so it’s not really a dead language.  I consider it a language that is making a resurgence.\n\nI have become a self-taught student of Stoicism and unfortunately at the moment, the only option at this time to better understand the fundamental concepts that pertain to Stoicism, is to read them from various authors and numerous translations of the original texts.  As I read and digest the fundamental concepts and how they work, I begin to practice them.  Sometimes I’m able to apply them to my daily life, but other times I don’t quite grasp the concepts.  Either I’m unable understand or I’m not sure I’m interpreting them correctly.  Currently I don’t have anyone to discuss what I’m reading and learning, and I’m hoping that with some assistance and guidance I’ll be able to gain a deeper and fuller understanding.  I am reaching out to your College with the hopes of filling in that gap of missing knowledge so that I can apply and practice it to my daily life as effectively as possible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, '', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', 0, 0, '', ''),

I still plan to take the degree even if it is no longer relevant for my career.\nI spent the last ten years working in the marketing sector, both as a freelance and as an employee.\nRight now, I\'m a Production Manager for a web agency, and my main goal is to manage 25 people, keeping them accountable for the deadlines while keeping the whole production profitable.\nI can say I love digital marketing, and I\'m fortunate to have a job that matches one of my passions.\n\nI\'m an active learner, and I love to spend time attending online courses on the most different subject thanks to the free MOOC available on digital platforms like Coursera, Edx, and so on.\n\nI also love technology, and I love to spend time programming (I\'m not a programmer tho) few personal website or scripts.\n\nAbout religion and philosophy.\n\nI started a couple of years ago getting interested in Buddhism, and a few months ago, I saw many points in common with the Stoic philosophy.\nI\'m not new to Stoic philosophy because, during high school, I had the opportunity to study it thanks to philosophy and Latin courses.\nSince the beginning, I was very fascinated by this way of thinking, but I never considered it as a way of living.\n\nUnfortunately, due to a "not so good" professor assignment to our class, I never had the opportunity to go deep in learning philosophy. The professor never really teched this subject.\n\nOne thing I know for sure is that Stoicism is much more than what we usually imagine. Sometimes a Stoic person is depicted simply like someone who stays strong against pain or adverse time. Sometimes even like one who loves suffering.\nThe reality is not just staying strong, but it is also about why/how a Stoic person reacts that way to counteract life\'s adversities.\n\nI\'ve been raised as Catholic, but in the last ten years or so I changed my mind. If I have to choose a word to describe myself better right now, it could be agnostic.\nAgnostic is quite close to the way I think and see the world.\nReligion started to feel a little bit too abstract for me, I know that it is mainly based on faith, but too many times, it seems more built by humans than inspired by God.\nFor this reason, also the Buddhist philosophy I\'m interested in is based on Theravada tradition (less connected with deities and supernatural things) or early Buddhist scriptures. I also appreciate secular Buddhism.\n\nI consider myself a rational mind, with a scientific and logical mindset. For this reason, it is quite tricky for me to beliving in inexplicable things.\nI usually look for facts and proofs that sustain every theory.\nIf I consider to believe in something or choose a new lifestyle, I need to test it by myself. This new thing could be as simple as a new diet or as complex as a new religion or system of belief.\n\nOne of the best things I love about Buddhism (and Stoicism is also close to this idea) is that it teaches you how to improve your life without relying on external factors.\nYou are your own instrument for a better and mindful life. You learn to goo deep in the meaning of the thing.\n\nEspecially in this time wehere we are all quarantined due to the Coronavirus, it is quite difficult for me to understand how some people just rely on hope and external faith. A lot of people are working hard, trying to fix the situation, and we need to be an active part in this not just staying sit down watching.\n\nRight now, I don\'t have a specific way to define myself. I think I\'m still exploring the world, looking for "instructions" on how to have a happy life. Sometimes I think this will be an endless journey, a journey called life.\nWe are evolving each day, so our search for a meaning.\n\nOne thing I know for sure is that I want to bring a positive impact while walking on this planet.\nA few years ago, I was more ambitious, focused on money and career, external appearance. Today I think that should be other values the main inspiration for our daily life. Money and success should be a mean for doing good and not just a self-contained goal.\n\nI have a few books on Stoicism, but I never read them from start to finish. I have "Letters to Lucilius" by Seneca, "Meditation" By Marcus Aurelius, and a couple of books by Massimo Pigliucci (Italian philosopher).\n\nMany times I look for stoic content online, both on YouTube and through the different website talking about the topic.\nLooking online, I found many exciting new things like the philosopher Massimo Pigliucci, the Stoicon initiative, and of course, The College of Stoic Philosophers.\n\nI\'m looking, thanks to SES, to learn more about Stoicism, its principles and the way to experiment it in daily life. This course could also finally be the right opportunity for reading all the books that I never finished.\nNot less important, I hope to find an eager community of Stoic practitioner and students with witch confront myself to improve even more.\n\nI\'m ready to start as soon as possible this new path, acquiring new (but we can also say 2000 years old) knowledge.\n\nMartino Bonanomi\n\n\n\n\n', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, '', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', 0, 0, '', ''),

As I grew older, I started reading science fiction because I found interesting the way this genre could give examples of how humans would behave in completely different and imaginary societies and situations. \n\nMy interest in Philosophy started at 13 years old. I was lucky to have a good philosophy teacher that not only taught history of philosophy, but we also show us ethics exercises and logic problems, but I thought it was only interesting from general knowledge and cultural point of view. \n\n  	I\'ve spent many years reading authors like Jared Diamond, Yuval Harari trying to understand more about the human condition and our development as a society. My last endeavor was finishing and executive MBA program, which I started just to get a better understanding of the current economic system and the "Homo Economicus". So, you can say that my first efforts to know myself were to try to understand Man form the outside in, in other words, our species, our biology, our psychology, our society to learn how we came about and where are we going.\nIt was 2 years ago, my interest in philosophy got rekindled through a podcast called "Philosophize this",  through which  I found Massimo Pigliucci´s "Stoic Meditations" podcast, and it was the first time that I saw philosophy and stoicism as a way of life. \n\nAs the meditations went by I started got to understand why my parents acted so differently to everybody else\'s, I believe they live an austere and stoic life, a very happy fulfilling and loving life and I have always wanted that for myself and my family. I also learned that I had an erroneous opinion of what Stoicism was about, originally I thought that stoics were superhumans snobs that had complete control of their feelings and emotions and impervious to human suffering and that they expected that everybody should be like them and if not you were considered inferior, but through Prof. Pigliucci´s podcast I learned that it was more than a philosophy it was a way of life and that it was a forgiving, respectful and humble and at the same time purposeful and demanding. \n\nSo I started to look for ways to get trained in stoic philosophy, and doing some research on the internet I stumbled on your website and found very interesting how the setup of the training program tries to teach stoicism the way it was taught in antiquity,  through a student and mentor relationship, and yet keep it alive and in the present. I also liked that you had a preparatory school. It is so important that this knowledge is taught at the right age, I have a 13-year-old son that is interested in philosophy. \n\nI consider myself an Agnostic, I was never religious, except when I was 27 years old, I had a spiritual crisis and started to investigate religions to fill this void. The catholic religion was more formal, and I had easy access to it, so an Opus Dei friend got me into their religious training "Program". Sufficient to say that I lasted less than a year although I tried my best, it is hard to advance as a Cristian if you don´t "Believe". I liked many of their stoic practices but did not like their emphasis on purposeful personal sacrifice and suffering to advance spiritually. \n\nWhen asked if I am Stoic, I have no formal training, nor have I read any of the masters, so I have no criteria to know if I am one or not. I can only answer that my parents instilled stoic principals in me through example, many times it was difficult for me to understand why they acted and how their decisions were so different  from everybody else, but I can give you examples:\n\n•	I was a champion swimmer, trained 6 days a week since I was 8 years old, my dad accompanied me to every swim meet if I won I received a simple hug and just said to me "keep at it" If I failed I just received another hug and another "keep at It".  No-fuss, no parties, no end of the world moments.\n•	I thought we were the poorest kids in the street, my parents had the oldest car and we seldom wore name brand clothes for me these were signs of wealth, but for my father, the quality of the food we ate, education, culture and the families economic security were his priorities. Although we did not have cool cars and clothes my father spent a lot of money in culture travel for the family so we went to Europe and the US many times when I was a child I did not understand the value and the costs associated with this. For them, the achievement of status is a waste of resources.\n•	My parents had restaurants and a small Hotel, when I was a child my father was always working. So when business was doing good he decided he was going to take a year sabbatical with the sole objective to be there for us, he was so happy that he ended spending 2 years sabbatical and as a consequence one of his partners betrayed him and he lost and important income. He always said it was money well spent and he just had to work harder to make it up, we deeply understood that we were one of his top priorities and that money is just a tool. \n\n\nIf asked what to expect from this and the stoic philosophy course?\n\nI would have to divide the answer into parts:  \n\n•	Intellectually, I expect to learn how and why the Stoics developed their philosophy and the influence it has on modern human thought and customs. I want to learn the history behind the stoic philosophers.\n•	Spiritually, I believe that the search for human happiness/reduction of suffering comes from the inside out. I want to have more tools that help me navigate life with purpose and sense of coherence with my guiding values. I want a system or a guide for better living.\n•	Emotionally, I want to follow my intuition, two years have passed since I first found this course and I still want to study it. In short, it feels like the right way to go.\n\nThank you for the opportunity to apply.\n\n\n', 1, '2020-09-20', 1, 0, 0, '', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', 1, 0, '', ''),

I am still surprised by what happened.  First, I stayed in the program.  After my second meeting a lady approached me and urged me to get to work on the steps right away.  She became my sponsor and I worked over the next couple of months I worked the steps.  This isn\'t about my sobriety journey,  but my that road led me to Stoicism.\n\nFor 28 years I abused drugs and alcohol.  In 2014 my ex-husband (the father of my youngest daughter) committed suicide as a direct result of alcoholism.  My youngest daughter had also started down the path of alcoholism.  The suicide hit me hard- and my answer was to escape the pain.  I moved to Austin, TX and dropped out of the world.  I was a victim- had always seen myself as a victim.  My emotions led me around by the nose.  At the end I knew I was going to die- not in some histrionic "I\'m going to kill myself" kind of way- I just felt the end had come and knew there was no where to run.  I had some familiarity with AA from watching my ex-husband go in and out- and because of his failure I didn\'t have much faith in the program.  I didn\'t understand how admitting I was powerless and giving my will over to a God I didn\'t understand would do a bit of good- the steps on the wall reminded me of the steps to Salvation that were pounded into my head as a child.  I wanted no part of a God who was sitting in the sky with a giant flyswatter ready to whack me at any moment. \n\nOne of the first things that my sponsor told me was that much of what I worried about was none of my business.  Most of the things I worried about- what other people were thinking or doing was out of my hands and something I no longer had to think about.  It was pretty clear that I was powerless over drinking, but really I was powerless over most everything.  I was able to see my patterns and how quickly things got messed up when I tried to do God\'s job.  I made my amends where I could- and the biggest amends of all was living differently.  I have to constantly be present and consider my thoughts and intentions- setting them right when I mess up.  And in order to be useful to anyone, I needed to improve my conscious contact with God as I understoond him- this is a lifetime undertaking.  I knew I wasn\'t God, and I knew I believed in some power, but it still didn\'t make a lot of sense to me.  My sponsor is a Buddhist- she encouraged me to find a formal spiritual path.  \n\nOne night about six months after joining AA I was taking a Lyft home from a meeting.  The driver and I started chatting and he told me he practiced Stocisim.  I was curious and asked him a lot of questions.  He recommended a podcast called "Stoicism on Fire".   I began to listen and found I had a great desire to learn more.   The twelve steps came alive for me as a real working part of my life.  I noticed I was better able to manage my emotions and approach life more logically.  The dichotomy of control is the hulu hoop I heard about in the rooms- t found such freedom and relief understanding that I no longer have to worry about anything that is not of my own doing.  All I have to focus on is my thoughts, opinions,  motivation, desires, aversions.  My goal should be to live a virtuous life- and I have to watch my desires and aversions (a two sided coin).  Not worrying, not having to be in control- knowing I am not in control- and that even the most disturbing events are just events and don\'t have to consume me has been a revelation.  "I have to die.  If it is now, well then I die now; if later, then now I will take my lunch, since the hour for lunch has arrived- and dying I will tend to later."  \n\nI\'ve read "Meditations" and listened to the Enchiridion on audio book.  I\'ve watched every lecture I can find on YouTube about stoicism.  So far I have found Chris Fisher\'s podcast and the Enchiridion to be most helpful.  I definitely feel like I am in the Traditional Stoicism camp- I believe in a higher power.\n\nI grew up Southern Baptist.  I\'ve kept what works and discarded the rest.  I cannot define God nor do I think I should try- I really prefer to think of a universal power that I can tap into.  God is personal to me, but I don\'t have a personal Jesus.  It is pretty cool that Paul was a contemporary of Marcus Aurelius and probably studied Stoicism.  \n\nIf I were going to join a church it would probably be the Unitarian Universalist church.  I toy with the idea, but haven\'t made a commitment.\n\nAs far as other philosophies:  I don\'t know a lot about philosophy.  I\'ve learned a little about Cynicism, Skepticism, and Epicureanism, but to tell you I\'m well-read or an expert on the subject would be untrue.  I took philosophy in college, but I don\'t remember much from the class.  I do remember I enjoyed logic very much- and I worked in Market Research for years which requires a lot of logic- that is one aspect of Stocism that really appeals to me.\n\nI do consider myself a Stoic.  It makes sense and it works.  \n\nWhat do I hope to get from this course?  I want to grow in understanding and ultimately I want to follow the path I believe my higher power has set before me.  It would be great if in the future I could help someone else- and I think the best way to do that is to learn and live what I learn.  \n\n \n- Stephanie Aronson\n', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, '', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', 0, 0, '', '');

Some people think it is interesting to talk about, some people feel uncomfortable and many people laugh at me when I ask bring up this question. For me talking about amor fati makes a lot of sense. To explain how amor fate got me into stoicism, this essay is structured as follows:\n-	First, some background information about me will be shared.\n-	Second, I will explain where my fascination with amor fati started. \n-	After that, I elaborate on some relevant personal beliefs and transformative experiences.\n-	Lastly, I will share some hopes on how stoicism will help me grow as a person. \n\nSome background information \nIn 1989 my life started. I grew up with my brother, little sister and both parents. My parents are the generation between the old structure ‘once a working class (wo)man, always a working class man’ and the new spirit ‘the sky is the limit’. My parents both come from working class families and felt the new breeze in town. They themselves never completely broke away from the old structure and did not aim for the stars, but if they noticed that we, as children, wanted to find out where our limit was they never held us back. \n\nI was a child with big dreams, but with little confidence in myself and the world around me. People often use the phrase ‘it takes a village to raise a child’. In our case our family had closed boundaries, so there was not a lot of village that could help me to explore unchartered territory.\n\nAt 19 I moved in with my boyfriend (now husband) and somewhere around that time I developed a new world view. I just finished my study pedagogy and started my (pre)master Social and Cultural Anthropology. Studying Anthropology gave me a new language to think about the reality around me. Also, around that time I met likeminded people who, in a loving way, challenged me.  From there onwards I had more faith in myself and the world around me. I shifted from fear based thinking to faith based thinking. I opened up to the world and allowed life to lovingly teach me; ‘it takes life to raise an adult’. \n\nSince that time I have lived in different places, met many inspiring people and tried out many new things. Now as a 30-year-old adult, me and my husband ended up (for the time being) in the same city we both grew up in, with our families and childhoods nearby. Even though it is fairly big city, it is not a creative place to life. Luckily we have time, technology and the network to not being confined to spatial and intellectual boundaries anymore. \n\nOne way of pushing my boundaries has always been exposing myself to new ways of thinking. Philosophy books have laid in my hands from time to time, but I never really studied one philosophy in particular. When amor fati became relevant in my life, I felt more and more the urge to dive into stoicism. Apart from reading about stoicism online, listening to some podcasts and watching Youtube clips here and there, I have read the following books: \n-	Holiday, The Obstacle is the Way\n-	Pigluicci, How to be a Stoic\n-	Seneca, On the happy lofe \n\nWhen talking to a friend, who considers himself a stoic, he recommended this course to me. I looked into this course and knew I needed to apply. I think there are a lots of similarities between stoicism and my personal beliefs. Completing this course is a good way to find out whether I could consider myself a stoic. \n\nAmor fati: would I, if I could start over, live my life differently? \nI came across the concept of amor fati in a book of two Dutch philosophers ‘De Vries’ and ‘Eskens’. After Eskens finds out that he terminally ill he, De Vries writes to Eskens to express his sorrow and brings up ‘amor fati’. You can imagine this becomes an interesting exchange of letters. Both philosophers looking at the same concept while being in opposite life phases; one busy living and the other busy dying. \n\nThe impact of this book cannot simply be explained because of the content of the book itself, it also came in my life when this concept was alive around me. Last year my father passed away after an intense 11-month sick bed. When he knew his life was ending sooner than expected, it a bitter conformation of his self-fulfilling prophecy. During his life my father was struggling. He felt when luck was handed he was standing at the end of a long long long long long line. I think that he, just as I, had the desire to explore, and he, just as I, was also scared to step into the unknown. But when he was faced with inevitable challenges that is a part of exploration, he aborted the mission with the hopes that next time luck would be on his side to have a trouble-free exploration. \n\nHis perception of life has always fascinated me because it was the opposite of what all my transformative experiences taught me. As a teenager this fascination resulted in picking fights with him. As a 30-year-old I turned to books for consolation and advise. Amor fati was the concept I kept thinking about during the last phase and after his passing. \n\nI cannot help but wandering what he would have said when I would have asked the question ‘Amor fati?’. I believe thought that he was just a pawn chess piece. Insignificant and no real control over his own whereabouts. I am not sure he would want to start his life over. Because it he was born as a pawn again, his life would be equally disappointing. Maybe if he was born as a king this time, he would be luckier and thus happier in life?\n\nFor my dad I imagine there would be a big difference between being born as a pawn or a king. In the one scenario he could be a winner and he would be a loser. I never understood this fatalistic view. I always saw more possibilities. For him he is a chess piece is played by whatever entity. I imagine I am one player using all the chess pieces to play against life itself. I believe in two facts of life. One, all people playing against life are losers. Second, even though we are going to lose, you can still win. \n\nBelief number 1: We are all losers!\nThe biggest misconception of life is that it should always be enjoyable and fun. I see life as something that is sometimes joyful, sometimes hard and most of the times something in between. \n\nAs a teenager I was suffering from severe scoliosis. This was difficult. Because it is not easy being 16 and looking like a hunchback. During my hospitalization at the children’s hospital I was surrounded with children with much worse medical conditions. I quickly released I had nothing to feel sorry about. After my operation and recovery period I could go on and live a ‘normal’ life. This life event taught me that health and normal looks is not something that we always have, it is something that we could have. So when I am faced with bad circumstances, I refuse to ask the question ‘why did this happen to me?’. Instead I ask myself the rhetorical question ‘why shouldn’t it happen to me?’. \n\nWhen being faced with challenging circumstances it helps to step back and zoom out. People have the tendency to feel that if something happens to them it is something unique. There are many children born with medical problems, so why should I have been any different? There are many children faced with challenges growing up, why should I have been any different? Every time I zoom out I see that other people are faced with the same external circumstances. All mortal beings are faced with loss, sickness, death, doubts and insecurities. It is what makes us human.\n\nI should mention here that this why is also why I am not a member of a religious fate. When I think about the possibility of one or multiple divine ruler(s), I do not understand/ agree with the distribution of hardship and welfare. I have been flirting with Buddhism for a while and still feel most connected to this religion, but I do not identify myself as a Buddhist.  But one always has to be able to switch opinions, so therefore I consider myself to be an agnost.\n\nBelief number 2: Your actions matter\nSome people think refusing to wallow on the ‘why me’ is an unhealthy coping mechanism. They feel I over rationalise things and do not allow myself to feel. I do not think this is the case. Of course I do feel sad, anger, betrayal, fear and have bad days where my mood takes over, but there is no point of wallowing on this. There is no point of wasting time, energy and brain space to things that we cannot change. I would rather use life experiences for personal growth.  \n\nFive years ago I worked with migrant communities in slums in India. Before visiting their community, I was nervous. I expected to see so much pain and suffering. When entering the community, it took me a while to process everything that I saw happening and get accustomed to the smells. At some point my eyes were really opened and saw children chasing each other and laughing, women happily chatting and some people doing their household chores. At that moment it hit me; I expected those people sitting in the corner of the tents crying all they because they live in extremely challenging and dehumanizing circumstances. Even though their circumstances were as bad as imagined, they showed me that life goes on.  \n\nTo set a sharp contrast, in the Netherlands many (young) people are struggling to find happiness, resulting in many burn-outs. They have access to so much more than some people, but do not feel happy and come to a standstill. They are not able to decide between accepting or finding joy in taking actions towards the desired change. \n\nThis off course is an absurd comparison, but I am trying to point out that the external conditions are not giving meaning to your life, meaning making happens in our mind. Victor Frankl’s book ‘Man’s search for meaning’ is a telling example that even in the most horrendous circumstances people can choose their attitude. There are many stories of challenging experiences that are empowering and transformative. \n\nI am a true perfectionist, which has often stopped me from trying because there is the risk of failing. But somewhere along the line I was able to embrace challenges. What saved me is that I am extremely curious and that I have experienced several times that I felt most alive when mastering something I thought that was not automatically in the cards for me. I think this rush is stronger than fear and the reason why I keep stepping into situations that scare the shit out of me.  \n\nWith practice and perseverance, we can take control over our own happiness. There are two options; accepting the situation and go with the flow (accepting defeat with grace) or find something you can have influence over and work with that (making your next move in chess). \n\nWhy stoicism?\nPeople are collective beings and therefore heavily influenced by the social, political and economic context we live in. This blueprint so much engrained in our minds, that we do not notice it there anymore. We look at reality with many blind spots. People for example see the world from the perspective of the pawn, but have forgotten there are other perspectives to look at the playing field. \n\nOne of the most valuable things I learned during my masters Social and Cultural Anthropology was the constant switching between the emic (the insider’s perspective) and etic perspective (the outsider’s perspective). Stoicism could be an interesting lens to look outside-in. \n\nI hope this course will help me to become a better person. I hope I will be better able to focus on the matters that are of real importance. What is and is not within my control? And what is the best decision (ethics)? \n\nI hope this will benefit my direct environment, but also contribute to work. I work in the social development sector. My days are generally filled with power and politics related dilemma’s. How can I make fair and just decisions that contribute to an inclusive, sustainable and equitable society? Currently navigating through this mine field takes much time, brain space and energy. I hope stoicism could be a good council to fall back to in difficult situations. Especially now during the corona crisis there is a lot of insecurities, where good advice is never redundant. \n', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, '', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', 0, 0, '', ''),

I just did not know that those concepts were based on works of the Stoics.  Recently, I have come to realize that my values and actions are indeed derived from Stoic philosophy.  \n\nIn early 2019, I listened to a podcast by Rich Roll, who frequently has in depth conversations with deep thinkers, cutting edge subject matter experts and generally interesting characters.  In the podcast, Rich interviewed Dr. Jud Brewer, a clinical psychologist who specialized in cognitive behavioral therapy.  He cited how effective his approach was to help change the behaviors of all types of addicts by focusing them on the mindset and physical experiences in which they were engaging during those addictive behaviors.  He went on to talk about Cognitive Behavioral Therapy and briefly referenced Stoics as the original CBT experts.  The host referred to author Ryan Holiday’s work sharing Stoic history and philosophy as a reference point.  It was from that podcast that I became “hooked” on studying and understanding Stoic philosophy.\n\nI began to research the history of Stoic philosophers.  I bought, read, and reread “The Daily Stoic” by Ryan Holiday.  I signed up to receive both the Daily Stoic email and podcast and subscribed to another Stoic blog. I read and continue to study the entire glossary of “The Daily Stoic” which lead me to additional research and studying.  I find the specific citings in the glossary incredibly fascinating.  It has led me to believe that many common Stoic terms are misunderstood.  For example, Eupathia is the opposite (and positive) emotion to Pathos (which is strictly negative and includes the idea of pleasure.)  Another small fascinating example is that there are 3 Stoic disciplines for action:  1. Study/Learn; 2. Practice; 3. Train.  To the Stoics, practice was a pre-cursor to training which seems vastly different from our current terminology where training and practice are synonymous.  \nThe more I read and studied, the more Stoicism gave voice to my personal approach and philosophy to life.  The idea that every hardship is an opportunity to practice a virtue is particularly meaningful.  The single greatest concept, which has dramatically changed my life view, is “Amor Fati”.   I know that the term “Love Fate” was coined by Friedrich Nietzsche, but it succinctly reflects a major Stoic philosophy touted by Epictetus.  Epictetus’ quote of “Do not demand that things happen as your wish but wish that things happen as they actually happen” has helped me to accept my current experiences with less judgement and has resulted in my acceptance, acquiesce and in fact, happiness for each situation I encounter.\n\nI am on a journey of self-understanding and Stoicism is key to helping me practice becoming a more evolved human being.  I aspire for a wide breadth of understanding, which is why I am also practicing mindfulness with focused periods of daily mediation.  Additionally, I am currently reading John Minford’s translation of the “Tao Te Ching” by Lao Tzu, have recently read “How to Be an Epicurean: The Ancient Art of Living Well” by Catherine Wilson and pay attention to the Facebook page “The Psychology of Stoicism, Buddhism and Epicureanism.”  I aspire to be well informed but also believe it is more important to focus on wisdom, applying and practicing insights.\n\nTo share my “Know Thyself” perspective here are some key thoughts.\n\nI am not a scholar.  In fact, I am more of a plodder.  I frequently must read, reflect and read again to truly understand those items I am researching.   Moreover, I would rather, read, reflect and practice applying a concept versus just intaking voluminous amounts of information. \n\nMy father and my sister are two of my largest influences.  My father has more integrity than anyone I know.  He is my Cato despite the fact he is unfamiliar with the history of the Stoics.  It was my father’s teaching and modeling of integrity that creates my resonance for Stoic principles.  My elder sister was born deaf, and spent her childhood switching between deaf schooling and typical public schooling due to the fact she could speak without much of an impediment despite having 93% hearing loss.  My sister took out her rage of being mocked and harassed by other children upon me, her younger brother.  The experience taught me to be able see through the eyes of others, both my sister’s and those of my parents.  It taught me that life is not always “just”, it is just life…so there is a need to accept and move forward.  Her experience taught me that resentment, anger, jealously and fear serve little value in increasing happiness.\n\n•	As a child I was raised as a Protestant attending the United Church of Christ and studied Catholicism in my 20’s to be able to marry my Catholic fiancé in a Catholic chapel.  I have always appreciated the basic tenants of Christianity (ie the 10 commandments) but have also seen great hypocrisy within organized religions.  Additionally, I struggled with the idea that a god is conscious of human life, much less conscious of a specific category of people (Christians, Muslims, Jews, etc.)  It is for multiple (empirical) reasons that I ascribe to no organized religion.  I call myself agnostic though I am most closely aligned with the Buddhists’ perspective on a life energy of the universe.\n\nI hold my relationship with nature sacred and to spend time in a mountain stream fly fishing for rainbow and cutthroat trout is one of my most gratifying past times.\n\nI am a deeply reflective person.  I strive to be the best person I can be, and to use my father’s words: “To look in the eyes of the person I see in the mirror and to be content with view.”  I believe it requires focus and constant commitment to remain a virtuous and authentic human being.\n\nI walk with gratitude.  I am truly thankful for the environment in which I live.  I have a loving wife, an amazing 17-year-old son who has a steadfast constitution and a 13-year-old daughter who is a bright and shining light in my life.  Moreover, I consider myself lucky to live in a city and region that I love.  I am able to bike to work daily seeing mountain, sea and cityscape in varying degrees of sunrise.  I feel gratitude for so much; for the feeling of the carpet under my toes in my bedroom, for the raindrops when they drip from the Japanese Maple Tree in my front yard.  I am grateful to be able to jog often, for the smell of the Pacific breeze when I close my eyes and for the ethics to which my company holds itself.  \n\nAs of late, I see beauty almost everywhere.  I think it is due to being thankful.\n\nI struggle to live up to the standards that I set for myself and are informed by the Stoics.  I can do better.\n\nAnd to answer one of your application questions, yes, I consider myself a Stoic.  In fact, it was when I was in “Becoming an Agile Leader” class, after several days of intense self-awareness training, they asked us to “walk the edge” and make a life declaration.  My declaration was “I am a Stoic”.  That declaration changed my life.  Until that very moment I had been “studying” Stoicism and I had been “practicing” Stoicism.  After that declaration, I became intensely focused on holding myself accountable to the awesome responsibility of being a Stoic. \n\nI understand that the declaration was audacious and presuming, despite the value it has brought to me.  If invited to join The College of Stoic Philosophers’ School of Essential Studies, I hope to become wiser.  I hope to more fully understand what it means to be a Stoic.  I hope to learn from and connect with other people who operate with similar values and philosophy.  I hope to understand the true meaning of philosophy.  I know that the experience will be humbling, and I look forward to being warrior of the mind and not just a librarian of the mind.\n\n\n\n', 1, '2020-09-09', 1, 0, 0, '', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', 1, 0, '', ''),

How long you have been interested in Stoicism?\nFollowing Stoicism as a concept…I believe I became first interested four years ago after a few YouTube videos on the topic, one in particular that stood out was titled PHILOSPHY – The Stoics from the School of Life channel.  It was a short four minute video on the topic.  After a few other videos and internet searches, I became aware of Letters from a Stoic: Seneca, and later the Thoughts of Marcus Aurelius…both books I downloaded for free from Project Gutenberg and I enjoyed immensely.  Upon further exposure to Stoic ideals, I found that some of my education and experience from the Marine Corps translated to Stoic ideology quite well.  A lot of Marine teachings were to maintain focus on what matters, push away the externals.  I really like the idea of developing an inner citadel and building a strong character.  I also like the idea that Stoicism is best practiced in the world through normal daily interactions in a society, no holed up in a monastery, physical or otherwise.\n\nMore recently I listened to the Stoicism on Fire podcast by Chris Fisher.  I am almost through listening to it completely for the second and third time.  It was through this podcast that I learned about the College of Stoic Philosophers and the programs that you offer.  Chris Fisher took my interest in the topic to the next level.  I never thought of Stoicism as a religious practice before learning about the nuances of the practice through Chris’s detailed narratives.  I really like way he explained the nuances of Stoicism.  I like that there is more to it than just basic modern interpretations of philosophy. \n\nStoic concepts speak to me, especially as I was going through a hard time in my life.  I was angry at a lot of things, and it seemed that applying at least a few Stoic principals helped me through some of my larger problems.  Specifically I learned to at least try and not let external issues that had no real value affect me.  I’ve done my best over the past four years to apply what I’ve absorbed from Seneca and Marcus Aurelius.  I found the practices to have a calming effect on me.  Family and coworkers have commented on how I’ve calmed down…less external things bother me than they used to.  I am excited for the opportunity to participate in a guided study of the essentials of Stoicism.\n\n2.	Any books you read on Stoic philosophy. If any, please list them.\n•	Letters from a Stoic: Seneca – Incredible book. I’m looking forward to reading again with new eyes.\n\n•	The Thoughts of Marcus Aurelius – Amazing insights from the Roman emperor.  Wonderful book that I will enjoy reading again and again. \n\n•	Stoicism – Apply Stoicism to your Everyday Life and Overcome Destructive Emotions, Geoffrey Loren, 2018 – Rather short book, more like a pamphlet, nice concise summary. \n\n•	A Little Book of Stoicism, St. George William Joseph Stock, 1908\n\n•	The Consolation of Philosophy of Boethius, 1897 Translation – a Project Gutenberg EBook\n\n•	Philosophies, by Ronald Ross, 1923 – a Project Gutenberg EBook\n\n•	The Five Great Philosophies of Life, William de Witt Hyde, 1924 – a Project Gutenberg EBook\n\n3.	Would you call yourself an atheist, agnostic/skeptic, deist, theist?\nI am agnostic only because being an atheist seems to require more commitment and work than I believe I want to apply on the topic.  I am open to the possibility of a greater power, but I cannot bring myself to believe in an Abrahamic god.  I always thought of God as a construction of man and that if anything a little piece of God is within us…together we are the God we manifest into religion.  I like the Stoic view of God, that there is a God of sorts.  From what I understand so far, the Stoic God is universal logic and order in the universe…not a guy you can talk to, nor someone to expect magic help from.  I like the Stoic concept of having an inner daemon...a piece of God that is inside of each human being.  Seems reasonable, at a minimum it doesn’t seem like it would hurt me to develop further some beliefs in the Stoic version of God as long as it adds value to the foundation of Stoic practices.\n\n4.	Are you a member of a religious faith? If so, which and for how long?\nI am not a member of a religious faith.  We do not practice religion in our house.  My family did not go to church or practice religion.  I did go to church with the friends when I was a teenager.  I studied some religions when I was younger to understand the basis of their beliefs.  I did observe many commonalities between the Abrahamic faiths, but never could believe.  I never really found Abrahamic faith all that compelling, but I appreciated many of the moral foundations.  I would say out of anything I do mostly appreciate Abrahamic moral teachings.\n\n5.	Have you studied philosophies other than Stoicism? If so, which?\nI have had some exposure to various philosophies in my bachelors and master’s degree programs…nothing super in depth.  In some of the books mentioned before in part 2 provided an overview of other philosophies.  \n\n6.	Do you consider yourself to be a Stoic?\nI do in many ways, or at least I am beginning to be a Stoic Prokopton.  I think the Stoic beliefs, the way of life, and the belief in logic and order in the universe mesh well with my identity and beliefs. \n\n7.	What you want to get from this course.\nI would like to gain a deeper understanding of Stoicism, I feel that a guided study will help cement the ideas into me better than just reading and self-study would.  I find it fascinating that many great leaders in history read Marcus Aurelius, Epictetus, and Seneca.  It is amazing to me that Stoicism hasn’t been more popularized, mainstreamed, and organized.  Stoicism seems like it could give Abrahamic faiths a run for their money.  \n', 1, '2020-09-28', 1, 0, 0, '', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', 1, 0, '', ''),

I’ll start by answering the requested questions directly as a means of foreshadowing the rest of this text, and then add context in subsequent paragraphs. I first became aware of Stoicism about 6 months ago; sometimes more philosophical youtube videos come up on my feed, and I think this was the first time I was introduced to the general ideas. Tim Ferris also recommended Tao of Seneca; I’ve read volume one so far. I’d usually read a chapter after meditating each day, and I’ve started on volume two. I haven’t intentionally read any other stoic texts completely. \n\nTraditionally, my family has been Christian by culture, but not particularly religious. My own philosophical views on how I understand the world (and how I practically behave) have changed over time; I think I might describe myself as a non-realist, but I’m not particularly qualified to make that technical claim either. If I had to give a very short summary of these beliefs in order to contextualize my interest in Stoicism, I would say that I think most of the impactful meaning the average person experiences in practice is arbitrary, in the sense that there are multiple very different meanings we can ascribe to the world which are consistent with “hard experience” (the more consistent properties which are closer to physical constraints). For example, people with different cultures can have very different subjective experiences of the world, and these experiences are a product of how they’ve habitually been conditioned to experience the world through their cultural context. If we had to break this down in detail, you might say that your experience is formed by the concept you put your attention on at any particular moment; I think meditation is one way of developing finer control of one’s moment to moment attention. So I tend to think that subjective meaning is arbitrary in the same sense that one’s parents might be arbitrary: the precise details of your parents might have been different (different hair color, different personality), but for most people their parents are still incredibly meaningful and important and worth living for despite being arbitrary in this sense, just like our arbitrary subjective framings of the world form the very basis of our reality.\n\n I think Stoicism is one such framing which seems practically useful, and so I would like to further develop my ability to frame the world from a Stoic perspective. I also believe that stoicism’s attitude of “focus on the things you can control; and there are many things which you can control, like how you frame an experience” are closely practically aligned with the non-realist view I described above. It seems to depart from the “blank slate” non-realism by also stipulating certain Stoic values we should try to uphold. My perspective on this is that these values are another worldview and culture I can learn to live by, practice and appreciate in any particular moment, but I don’t hold any strong views about whether any particular cultural view is in some sense “universally true” or needs to be consistently applied across time simply for the sake of some moral value; these claims seem like heavy burdens to make, and in practice an ad-hoc approach informed by experience (use the practices which empirically work best for you) seems to work best. I discovered the SES course when I was looking for mentors and a larger community of stoics, and I hope that the SES course might be a stepping stone towards finding such a community. \n\nHere’s a bit more about myself. I grew up in Cape Town, South Africa. The country is still fairly divided along racial and socio-economic lines following the end of apartheid in 1996, but perhaps one silver lining is the relative degree of openness and willingness to debate about difficult issues. For comparison, after I moved to the US for college, my friends were far less comfortable with having honest conversations about race relations or public policy along partisan lines; I remember once asking a Republican-leaning friend who had grown up in the military about their views on gun control, but they didn’t want to talk about it in the dining hall in case someone else overheard us talking! \n\nIn highschool I became very active in our debate team, where I would go on to compete at provincial and national levels. My specific strength was content generation; I tended to come up with lots of different arguments, and enjoyed creating convoluted philosophical reasons based on more traditional western philosophy. However learning to always prep two sides of the debate makes one realise that in practice, logical moral argument is in some sense uncompelling. If an excellently trained debater can make a very persuasive argument for or against any particular topic, then perhaps it would be a practically bad policy decision to put too much weight in any particular moral argument someone tries to sell you on. Over time, my perspectives changed from being obsessed with the correctness of logical verbal arguments about morality, to becoming more pragmatic about what an argument is and why we believe or interpret arguments the way we do. \n\nI was also quite academic in highschool; I won a few national olympiads in natural science and programming, and represented my country at some international programming olympiads and science forums. Separately from my highschool, I also wrote some A Levels when I was younger and half dropped out of my final year to take local university courses simultaneously. Afterwards I moved to Boston to start my undergrad at Harvard. \n\nOne of the most significant points of my undergraduate life was during my study abroad program. In retrospect, the way I approached life was very habitual. This was especially true with being proactive: my habitual response was to procrastinate with tasks, frame them as “work”, and then rush to finish them before the deadline. At the time, I remember lying on my bed, having these great ideas for projects I wanted to start, but being unable to make myself stand up and get started. I became curious about understanding this cognitive dissonance; I wanted to create a “theory of mind” which would help me practically explain why I feel certain ways and why in some sense it was impossible for me to get out of bed, even though it was “physically possible” for me to do so. This prompted the development of the worldview I have now -- one which I am still learning about. All I can say is that I practically seem to be more self aware of the primitive mechanisms which cause me to behave in certain ways (how I choose to frame ideas, noticing the onset of specific thought habits, and cultivating mental triggers to induce certain framings). Empirically, this approach has allowed me to be far more productive. Subjectively, I feel inspired more often, distressed less often, and I have a greater degree of control over correctively responding to unproductive distress. So at least on these measures, there seems to be some useful progress. \n\nI’m currently completing a DPhil/PhD at Oxford University; I’m mostly interested in trying to build the most effective practical Artificial General Intelligence with the time I have here. Other hobbies of mine include playing the piano and coding video games. I’ve especially felt an increase in personal development over the last 6 months in terms of the qualities I described in the previous paragraph; I think this is because the DPhil environment gives substantial space for self reflection, while also demanding a high degree of self-direction and regulation in such an unstructured environment. \n\nI look forward to hopefully meeting you and learning more about Stoicism! \n\n', 1, '2020-08-06', 0, 0, 0, '', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', 0, 0, '', ''),

As a result, I just chose the lazy way and didn\'t work on my soul until several weeks ago, when a recent breakup made me delve into stoicism once more: I instinctively knew that I had to turn to stoicism to help myself overcome the pain, and, more generally, my incorrigible social anxiety... and many other problems I\'ve been dealing with for as long as I can remember. I could never live in the present moment, I tend to regret my past and worry about the future. I know, it\'s a classic, but at least I am now aware that my outlook in life could change with the help of Stoicism.\nI have read some exerpts of the Meditations of Marcus Aurelius (which I prefer to read in my native language, to really feel the messages he was conveying) and read Stoicism for beginners by Marcus T Ryan and Stoic Life of Parth Sawhney (both thorough). I have also listened to a fair amount of podcasts and interviews of lecturers (Massimo Pigliucci, Donald Robertson) and videos on Youtube (namely Eizelgänger, Philosophy for life) I have subscribed monthly to the app "Stoa" and passed my newly acquired knowledge on my friends over the phone, who are not experiencing the corona confinement as well as I do and are always eager to hear some wise words. We now tend to analyse whatever we tell each other under the "that was/\'nt quite stoic of you" angle. \n\nI was raised a Catholic and would be happily active in my parish as a child and young teenager before I gave up on religion to embrace it again in my late teens, to entirely rejected the Church. I have studied Islam (and its mystical branches such as Alevism and Sufism) and Christianity (catholicism and orthodoxy) and, to some extent, Buddhism, and I came to the conclusion that I find established belief systems more malevolent than benevolent. Before my beloved and very religious grandmother violently died a cancer, she was in a constant fear of being denied the gates to Paradise because of her "sins" (I quote) - I must underline the fact that she was the most generous and kind-hearted person I have ever met, and yet she believed that she wasn\'t worthy of God for some reason; moreover, instead of being relieved to finally meet God and rest in peace, just the thought of dying would put her in a panic state. She truly loved life and couldn\'t enjoy the time she had left because of what her religion had taught her: that she should fear God. She even believed that she was hit by cancer because she "deserved it." She died in intense sufferings. She had raised me and we had a very strong connection together. I know that she\'d have given me a sign from the Heaven if it existed. I am against institutionalised religions because I believe that they don\'t empower people - instead, they disown them from their sense of responsibility (praying instead of acting) and make them feel guilty for whatever they do, think or are - same goes with Islam and its "inch\'Allah" or Hinduism with its cast system ("you were born in this low class because in another life you misbehaved; now behave accordingly to your class ad you\'ll be rewarded in your next life") I\'ve had debates around religion so many times in my life I can easily say that it is the topic I have used the largest quantity of saliva upon, until it definitely tired me. Now, I just avoid the topic as much as I can, because it is unfortunately too sensitive of a subject to be addressed lightly. Of course, I always surprise myself praying during turbulences in my plane (old habits die hard) but then I remember that there is no reason I\'d be saved when people not meaner than me are dying at the same moment, in spite of their own desperate prayers. \n\nMy major in high school was philosophy (7 hours a week) and I\'ve had classes of logic, political philosophy, philosophy of religion and philosophy of Islam at the university. I have been interested in Nihilism but find that this latter doesn\'t bring any practical advice to go through life and improve oneself, unlike Stoicism. The Nihilist community is, in my opinion, quite dark, when what I need is light. Stoics, because they do their best to live rightfully and with virtue, form a community that inspires me to become a better day after day. Proof is, it took me two days of stoicism study to quit a ten-year smoking cigarettes habit, because I eventually realised that this simple thing I was enjoying was holding me back in my attempts to improve myself in general. I became instantly passionate about taking care of my body, brain and soul. I haven\'t even had any withdrawal effects because I didn\'t try to quit, I just did out of burning desire to become the best version of myself.\nI think it wouldn\'t be wise of me to call myself a Stoic yet. I am a wannabe Stoic if you will, but I am still struggling to apply into my life and my mindset all the knowledge I have collected. I need to rewire my brain entirely and that requires time and devotion. I\'m not there yet, but this is what I expect the course to help me with. My goal is to then enroll the Marcus Aurelius school and maybe one day the Fourth school, to go very deep into the study and open myself to the metaphysical side of the philosophy.\nAs a side note, I am yet to hear a woman\'s perspective on Stoicism. If you wonder why I think gender has an importance in this context, here\'s a pennyy for your thought: women tend to look more into the future than men do (and sooner in life) Right before a new menstruation cycle starts, we tend to be more insightful about the near or far future, make plans towards it etc, and this is only an example of the difference cognitive responses men and women experience since the two genders are very different, hormonally speaking. I haven\'t read nor heard much from women stoic and it seems like a lot is yet to be explored in that regard, and, when comes the day, I\'d personnally like to make a difference in that community.\n\nI hope you\'ve enjoyed reading me.

I’m married with no kids. I was born in São Paulo, Brazil in 1987, son to a successful businessman, who lost almost everything when his company went bankrupt in the 1990s, and to a mother who became very religious after this experience and has become a devoted catholic ever since. I never considered myself a spiritual person, religion never offered me what I needed. I could never get a clear explanation of life and its purpose from any religion. I consider myself a person who believes in science above all else. I use to tell people I was an agnostic. My parents on the other hand, still believe I will find God and religion when life throws me a curveball bad enough.\n\nThe period of my life where my father was trying to save the family’s company, while my mother dove deeper and deeper into a religion I couldn’t agree with, gave me a severe anxiety disorder. My mother feared for our uncertain future daily, while my father was doing everything he could to spare my sister and me from our economic downfall. I also believe my ADHD has its roots in this chapter of my life as well. I managed to graduate in Business Administration and Product Design from two of the top Brazilian Colleges, something I am very grateful for my father, despite his downturns, he managed to give me the best study, and I made sure to make it worth his money.\n\nI first came across Stoicism about five or four years ago, via a YouTube video. It told the story of Zeno and how Stoicism came to be. I remember thinking to myself that this philosophy explained exactly what I wanted in terms I could understand and agree to. It all made a lot of sense to me. Helped by the fact that I am sort of an amateur historian, I’ve been studying history as a hobby, ever since I was a teenager. Most of my money went to buying books back then and the ancient world has always been a major interest of mine, especially the Greek world, so it was as if something immediately clicked in me. But this was only my first introduction to Stoicism.\n\nThe reason I moved to Miami, FL was to join a newly formed Venture Capital fund to invest in technology startups. I had a stellar career working for Facebook and I’m deeply passionate about technology and entrepreneurship (I founded two startup companies myself). I was ready for a new challenge. After one year on the job, I found myself doing something I absolutely loved but I hated the people and company I was working for, so I decided to quit. Looking back, it was nobody’s fault but mine, I had taken a very senior position and I had no experience working at this seniority level. I was at least ten years younger than my all peers. Suddenly, I found myself in a new country with no job, which in turn gave me a mild depression and a sense of hopelessness. That’s when I slowly started to dedicate myself to the study of the Stoic philosophy.\n\nWith more time on my hands, I decided to read the Meditations from Marcus Aurelius, and I was overwhelmed by what I found. It was exactly what I was looking for. I learned what a philosophy of life was and how important it is to have a higher purpose. I was impressed by how a knowledge so old such as Stoicism could apply itself to the present so perfectly. This also sparked a much bigger interest in Philosophy in general but it was Stoicism that offered me the best guidance. I have also studied Buddhism and taken on the practice of meditation on a daily basis, I feel this practice is a good companion to the study. Stoicism taught me many things, but it was the dichotomy of control that taught me to control and manage my anxiety and ADHD. I never liked taking medicine for it, so it felt as if I had acquired a tool to conquer myself. It gave me power over my thoughts and consequently my own life and choices which, although so obvious now, I didn’t know I had it in me. I learned how to let go of what is not important and focus on what I could control. This helped me create my own future, I now work for another VC firm in Florida, and I love what I do. I have filled my life with good habits and got rid of vices and self-harming attitudes. My relationships changed, not only with my wife but with friends and family too. I developed a strong sense of empathy and become aware of my own emotions as well. I learned to see nature as it is and to understand how we are all part of it, and that living in accordance with nature is the true path of least resistance.\n\nMy awakening was so big that even the concept of Logos to the Stoics made sense to me. Having a reason that permeates the creation of the cosmos is the best explanation of a God I could find. This changed my understanding of life so much that I now have λόγος tattoed on my forearm, so I can remember every day what it means. After this first real experience with Stoicism, I have read How To Think Like A Roman Emperor by Donald Robertson, Rome’s Last Citizen by Rob Goodman, The Obstacle Is The Way by Ryan Holiday as well as multiple articles, podcasts, TED talks and YouTube videos on Stoicism. I’m familiar with the major Stoic sages but I haven’t read the works from Epictetus or Seneca yet.\n\nI now consider myself a Stoic, and that’s what I tell people when they ask me what religion I follow, I say I don’t have a religion but I have a philosophy of life, Stoicism. I feel I have only touched the surface on my studies on Stoicism and I’m ready to dedicate myself properly to the study of this philosophy and, hopefully, one day become a Stoic Sage myself. I know the road is long and that the obstacle is most definitely the way, but the pursuit of knowledge is one of my biggest drives in life. The knowledge that the Stoics gave me empowered me with the best tools and mental fortitude to lead a happy life and have my mind at ease. I’m sure that if accepted, and after completing the course, I will look back and see how limited my understanding was, but that’s exactly what I’m hoping for.', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, '', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', 0, 0, '', ''),

By my late 20’s, I had begun my pursuit of a career in art, amid becoming a father and divorcing. I went from job to job, career to career in search of the identity I longed for. The sense of being lost was accurate. \n\nMy name is Charles Clendenin and I have felt lost for most of my life.\n\nI early discovered an affinity for alcohol and the illusion of reprieve I got from it. As my life unraveled, my drinking became tightly woven with my existence. I knew if I went on like this, I would meet my ultimate fate… sooner, rather than later. I was lost and looking in all the wrong places.\n\nAt my lowest, I experienced frequent run ins with the authorities, and worse, further disconnection with myself. Life had no purpose, no meaning, and the only direction my life was headed was down. Lost and hopeless, I embarked on a journey of sobriety. It took me 6 years to get 1 year of consecutive days without an intoxicant. As I began to take my sobriety journey seriously, the spirituality I had been avoiding became the very foundation of my survival. Spirituality and a GOD of my understanding play a major role in the program I participate in to gain and maintain consecutive days of sobriety. My spirituality has developed in manageable stages throughout this process and has evolved from a dependence on a vengeful, jealous god to a belief that GOD is powerful, but reasonable. While I found sobriety over 11 years ago, the GOD of my understanding continues to evolve. Christianity to wholly self-created faiths… I have tried many on for size, true connection eluding me.\n\nFor the last 2 years, I have been joyfully exploring Buddhism and its many flavors. I have found partial connection to their practices, yet I have never thought of myself as a Buddhist. I was inspired by the concept that I was part of the actual equation, rather than at the mercy of the rod. The journey continues. By chance, I came across an article about the differences between Zen and Stoicism and it redirected my search. Upon initial investigation, I have found FULL, intuitive connection with what I have been exposed to thus far of the Stoic philosophy. I was very interested in philosophy in college as a major, but deterred at the time by the well-meaning counselor that reminded me that I “might want to be able to provide for a family one day, something like business will be better suited for that.” As a directionless youth, I took the advice as wisdom I did not yet have.  I am flabbergasted that my collegiate exposure to Stoicism in the multiple philosophy classes didn’t produce that connection, but I also know that the lenses of my experience at that time would not be able to identify the connection I feel today. If my tangled journey has led me to where I am today, I would not change a thing. It points to the very providence I have discovered in Stoic teachings. The introductory quote above is from a text I reference in sobriety and I finally feel like I have found the direction, and community, I have been searching for. With that being said, I am aware that I have much to learn and that is exactly why I am writing this. \n\nI found SES via binging Chris Fisher’s “Stoicism On Fire” podcast and here I am, 2 weeks later. Although my knowledge and understanding are elementary, I am a Stoic. I connect with most every word I read, and the intent of practice as I understand it fits within (and even exceeds in some areas) the intentional result I am seeking through practices that mesh with my moral compass. I am particularly drawn to the logic, the GOD I understand of traditional Stoicism, mindfulness, and the focused awareness of mortality and the gratitude it breeds. I currently have a disciplined meditation practice and feel that it has been enhanced by integrating the Stoic aspects I have been exposed to. Additionally, I really connect to the practiced routine of Stoics, and of each day being a separate life. It feels like home.\n\nI have read many articles online awaiting the arrival of books, including the entire suggested reading list for this course, as well as Chris Wilson’s book “Stoicism,” and Seddon’s “Stoic Serenity.” I continue to scour the net for articles while consuming podcasts and YouTube videos. It is becoming increasingly evident that not all information Stoicism contains the same value, although it ALL has some.\n\nIf accepted into this course, my plan is to continue with the additional courses offered if permitted. I hope to get a practical understanding and framework of the philosophy, it is history, framework, and practice. Of the articles I have read, and podcasts listened to, I have come across different aspects of Stoicism, as well as different schools and applications. I hope that through this course, I will have a comprehensive foundation to propel what I feel will be a lifelong exploration and application of the Stoic philosophy. And finally, I am craving fellowship, becoming part of a community. A community of like-minded, supportive people on their own journey and willing to share their experience and wisdom. A community that fosters personal growth and kindness. Mindfulness and gratitude. Balance and routine. I am confident that I have found all of this in Stoicism. \n\nI am excited to learn what I do not know, yet grateful to be exactly where I am.\n', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, '', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', 0, 0, '', ''),

But I couldn\'t keep up with it because I had a more than full-time job that had lots of distant travel.  So I discontinued studies.  Since then, someone in Human Resources noticed the date-of-birth on my file and decided I should retire.  I\'m still an occasional advisor, but the load is not as heavy as it was six or seven years ago.  So I\'d like to start again.  I wrote a message to Chris Fisher, but have received no response.  Perhaps he has changed his email?  (I have christopher_fisher@msn.com).  The following essay is an up-dated version of the one I submitted back in 2013.  It has a fair amount of personal information, so please do not circulate it further than necessary.\nWith thanks, and abundant good wishes.\nBill Clark', 'Know Myself\n\nMarcus Aurelius provides a good way to start.  He commenced his Meditations by announcing gratitude to many people who had helped him to grow, who had influenced him in ways that provided important benefits. I shall do the same, but with a somewhat different perspective.\nMost of the people Marcus Aurelius acknowledges had positive influences on his life. Many of the people I will acknowledge provided me with good lessons regarding what to avoid.\nThus, to William Joseph Clark, my father, I owe a very great debt for having taught me how alcoholism, violent temper, divorce, bigotry and suspicion can coalesce to destroy a life. And to my mother Genevieve Rita (Hunt) Clark, I owe a somewhat lesser debt for having taught me how anger, divorce and neglect can coalesce to destroy another life. I learned how their marriage was doomed, and how their children were used as pawns in child-custody battles, only after I had gained enough maturity to understand.  Before that awakening, I had only a visceral sense of wrongness and vulnerability.\nThere were others. Sister Theresa at St. Helena School in The Bronx taught me that no Protestant could ever go to heaven. Nor would I, if I missed church on Sunday. Wilton, at summer camp, taught me that some people enjoy making others fearful. Dennis taught me that theft is a sport. And there were many other persons who used their best resources to expose me to anxieties and fears and prejudices that should never be imposed upon a child.\nA youthful small “s” stoicism was already developing within me.\nThere were exceptions. My maternal grandmother Margaret (Mulligan) Hunt, an Irish immigrant, sheltered me during divorce and child custody proceedings. She was kindly, and sought to protect me. Likewise, my paternal grandfather, also William Joseph Clark, a retired New York City policeman, from time to time shared my miseries and provided solace. He told me that I carried a small amount of Cherokee ancestry, enough to have reverence for Nature.\nI thank Paul Krause, my biology teacher at Newtown (Connecticut) High School who, on the first day of class, announced that the Board of Education forbade students from reading the biology text book chapter on evolution. The only reason we had a text with such a disreputable chapter was that in 1958, there were no high school biology text publishers who didn’t include it. Mr. Krause carried on so famously, expounding on the evils of evolution, and how Darwin himself was certainly burning in Hell at that precise moment for his role in corrupting the minds of innocent children, and how the very concept of evolution was anathema to all that was holy in the distinguished opinions of the members of the town Board of Education. He muttered something about evolution being an idea at least as dangerous as thoughts opposing a heliocentric universe or a flat earth. Of course, everyone went home that evening and read that entire chapter with very great diligence, and it was the subject of heated school yard discussion for a long time thereafter. I still get emails from former classmates on this subject.\nAnd I still have my 1936 Modern Library edition of the Origin of Species, which I purchased in a second hand bookstore shortly after being so charmingly exposed to Mr. Darwin’s idea.\nI started to ponder stoic interests in the unity of life and of the material universe and its origins, long before I ever heard of Zeno or Chrysippus.\nOthers have taught me. Sergeant Donald Welborne, one of my Drill Instructors at Marine Corps Recruit Depot, Parris Island, South Carolina, taught me self-discipline. More than any one else, he taught me that I could accomplish much more than I thought I could do. He taught me the importance of loyalty, trust and teamwork. He taught me determination and responsibility, honor and courage. He taught me to live by my word. He taught me virtues that my parents should have taught me. \nI am thankful also to Truman Warner, a social studies professor at Western Connecticut State University, for having taught me how to think, how to immerse myself in a subject and find happiness in exploring new ideas, and how to be constructively critical.\nI am grateful to my wife Judith (Shapiro) Clark for encouraging me to live correctly, for never being fully satisfied regardless how well some effort may result. She has taught me that there is always room to improve. She has taught me that a worthy person must always carry more than a fair share of any burden.\nI am grateful also to several flight instructors who taught me the liberating exhilaration of serious aerobatics, and to several music instructors who taught me to appreciate, play and release myself into the abstract wonders of classical music.  Further, I am grateful to some unknown, inept Soviet factory worker who provided me with an opportunity to experience imminent death and appreciate my reaction to that without actually having the deed consummated.\nTurning to the specific points required of this essay:\n* I was born on 11 July 1943 in Hunts Point Hospital, in a poor and violent neighborhood of the South Bronx, New York.\n* I have been interested in stoicism since 1964, when I first read Marcus Aurelius’ Meditations.  That book was a gift from a Marine infantry radio operator who I replaced in Quang Nam province.  He told me that it would be the best way to protect my sanity until it was time to go home.\n* I cannot recall all the books on stoic philosophy that I have read – for the most part, there were general philosophy books that include sections or chapters on stoicism, although I have read some Marcus Aurelius and some Seneca. And there are also books by philosophers not normally identified as stoics, such as Baruch de Spinoza, who I think was very close to stoicism.\n* Regarding religious beliefs, I would dodge the question by quoting Einstein’s answer. If I have any religious sensitivities at all, they would be most akin to Spinoza’s peculiar type of panentheism.\n* No, I am not a member of any religious faith. I look upon organized religion, as Spinoza did, as “organized superstition.”\n* Yes, I have studied other philosophies, including the garden variety surveys taught in university philosophy courses. I’m broadly familiar with most Western philosophies from the pre-Socratics to existentialism. And I’ve dabbled a bit in Eastern philosophies – even attending lectures by the Dalai Lama twice!  I’ve also had the honor of being among a dozen or so co-authors writing a book with the Dalai Lama.\n* Yes, I do consider myself a stoic. Sort of. I have some uncertainty and difficulty with a few doctrines. For example, I am not persuaded by the concept of “stoic calm,” of having so much virtue that one is protected from misfortune. I am not even certain that I want that protection. I do not want to be detached. I do want to be involved, and to intervene where I can to achieve good. – But perhaps I do not understand stoicism well enough.  \n* My intention for this course is to learn more about stoicism so I might improve my life. I am indeed concerned by the incongruities of determinism and freedom. I do believe one’s philosophical beliefs should be practiced in daily life. I do believe that what I do with my life should be in accord with Nature – and even more, that it should, in practical ways, protect Nature in all her manifestations.\nI have passed my thousand words. But since I have 76 years of life experience, perhaps I might be indulged a few more sentences for this brief autobiography.\nIn addition to persons, there have been other influences in my life, that I look upon as “events.”  When the shooting stopped and my parents were finally divorced (yes, there literally were bullets shot into the floor, at moments of anger), my sister Pat and I were the subjects of child custody battles. My mother remained in The Bronx, and my father moved to Newtown, Connecticut (the same community that suffered a horrible massacre of school children and teachers on 14th December 2012). Newtown was a rural town, with many active farms and lots of Nature. Edward Knapp, a municipal judge, was an avid hunter. But in the springtime, the only animals he could legally hunt were those classified as “vermin.” One day in April, 1959, he shot a “vermin” fox. Moments later, he discovered he had shot a mother. But he was unable to kill the pups.  So he scooped them up and gave them to a high school teacher, Stuart Keller, who gave one of those pups to me. I called her Khrushchev, because she was red. I raised Khrushchev with consuming care and interest, and she rewarded me with friendship. We took many long walks together, exploring meadows and woodlands in an idyllic manner. She taught me to love Nature profoundly and unreservedly.\nMy experiences in the Marine Corps left me with the impression that people should be able to resolve their differences without resorting to firearms, explosives and pungi sticks. I thanked that inept Soviet factory worker because he assembled a hand grenade that turned out to be a dud. Otherwise, I would have been dead for more than 50 years by now.  Returning to the U.S., I went to college in Connecticut and, after graduating, attended law school at the University of San Francisco. While a student there, I had two other activities. One was working for Romer, O’Connor & Co., a law firm. They were hired by many petroleum companies to recover money from people who accumulated unpaid credit card debts.  My job was to call the debtors and inform them this was their last opportunity to pay up their Texaco or Esso or Sonoco card, and if they didn’t, we’d have no alternative other than to take them to court. I didn’t like that job, and I started to grow unhappy with the legal profession. At the same time, I volunteered on weekends with a group engaged in the rescue of sea birds in the South Bay area, down near Palo Alto. This was a time prior to environmental legislation, and many birds suffered from exposure to polluted waters. We rescued them, washed oil slick off them with detergent, and tried to nurse them to recovery. Many died. But some survived and were restored to Nature. I found my weekends much more gratifying than my week days.  So I resigned from law school (although I had a full scholarship) and went back East where I eventually started taking graduate courses in biology at New York University.\nI met Judith, my wife to be, in the spring of 1973. She is an Israeli national, and had been studying fine art at Cooper Union, in New York. We married in November that year and were blessed with a son, Joseph, a year later. I juggled family life, a job, and grad school until 1980 when Avraham Yoffe, the Director of Israel’s Nature Reserves Authority, offered me a job that I couldn’t refuse: Manager of Hai-Bar Yotvata, Israel’s desert facility for reintroduction of locally extinct wild animals – gazelles, ibexes, wild asses, oryx antelopes, ostriches and others.\nAn additional reason for moving to Israel was that Judith’s mother, Esther, wanted her daughter to live near her. Esther survived World War Two first in the Jewish Ghetto of Kovno, in occupied Latvia, and then in the Stutthof Concentration Camp. Her drawings of life during those times are important historical testimony of the Holocaust. They were used as evidence during the trial of Adolf Eichmann.\nI continued juggling family life, job and graduate work for another eight years, finishing my masters and doctorate, and taking pleasure in my family and my work. I also got drafted into the Israel Defense Forces but, because of my previous military service, was required only to do basic training plus one month of reserve duty annually, until age 55. I did a fair amount of field work in the Negev Desert during those years, especially on the white oryx (Oryx leucoryx) the subject of my dissertation. But participating in field efforts, I gradually became aware that much of my work involved documenting the destruction of Nature. Much of that destruction was illegal.\nBecause of my relatively good English skills, I also became the agency’s delegate to several international meetings, especially CITES (the UN-administered endangered species treaty), but also others. Here, I started meeting with African colleagues and I started learning they were facing a much greater crisis than I was. I started numerous cooperation projects. Senegal National Parks was soon outfitted with Israeli-made Motorola radios, a wildlife rescue facility sprouted up in Liberia, four used pickup trucks found their way to Ghana’s wildlife department.  And above all, there have been airplanes – to date, ten light aircraft have been donated to wildlife agencies in Ghana, Chad, Senegal and most importantly, Kenya.  I admire Kenya, and the Kenya Wildlife Service, because of their non-consumptive policies.  There has been on safari hunting, no trapping, no legal harm to wild animals in Kenya since 1977.  And the Kenyans have maintained a consistent policy on that through the years. I have found ethical national policies have positive influence on the types of people who are attracted to apply for positions of ranger or warden, and so one virtue makes additional virtues more accessible.\nJudith, Joe and I took a four-year leave of absence from 1988 to 1992. Judith is an accomplished painter, and won a competition sponsored by the French Ministry of Culture. The prize was use of a studio at Cite Internationale des Arts, in the center of Paris, right on the Seine. Joe was placed in Ecole Bilangue – a bilingual (French and English) school that helped him achieve full fluency in three languages – French, English and Hebrew – by the end of high school. And I had the distinct honor of being offered a “visiting scholar” slot at Museum National d’Histoire Naturelle – the French national museum of natural history – in Paris. I worked four years sharing a lovely room with Pierre Pfeffer, then director of research for mammals and birds at the museum. Together, we created a grand collaboration to protect elephants.\nWe called it Amnestie pour les elephants, and our principal objective was to put all elephants on Appendix I of the CITES treaty. We were successful. Details of the campaign can be read in Richard Leakey’s book “Wildlife Wars.” B ut, in brief, I prepared a draft proposal for CITES in Pierre’s grand office, and we divided Africa in half: Pierre took the French speaking countries, and I took the English speaking countries, and we lobbied them to sponsor the draft at CITES, and to insist on full international legal protection for elephants. The show-down came on 17th October 1989, with 74 countries voting in favor of the proposal, 11 opposed, and 4 abstaining.\nWe returned to Israel in the summer of 1992 and I went back to work with what had become the Israel Nature and Parks Authority. I was placed in the Department of Law Enforcement and my primary assignment was to serve as the Israeli delegate to INTERPOL’s newly created Environmental Crimes Committee, which was divided into two working groups – one on pollution crime and the other on wildlife crime. Simultaneously, I had a number of secondary assignments. One involved going through Israeli Police training and serving at least one day a week as a police officer. I was assigned to a unit responsible for security of public schools in Jerusalem threatened with terror attacks. Other work involved participating in a team that was helping Eastern European countries recover from communism and Soviet occupation. One particular memorable task was working with Hungarians who removed large quantities of toxic wastes from former Soviet bases, and converted those bases into nature reserves.\nBut work with INTERPOL remained my main preoccupation, and through the years I was engaged in many projects. My own preference was an effort to assist African improve their wildlife law enforcement capacities. Thus, we provided many training programs, lots of second-hand equipment, and we coordinated a good number of multi-country operations. Simultaneously, I graduated from a member of the Group to its Secretary and ultimately as its Chairman, a position that I held until 2010, when I retired from the Nature and Parks Authority.  Upon retirement, INTERPOL asked me who would continue with the work I had been doing.\nThey then offered me a contract to keep at it. A new Environmental Crime Programme was started in the INTERPOL General Secretariat, and I was made the coordinator for Project Wisdom, ECP’s efforts in Africa. I remain very active with that work, and am in Africa about four or five times a year. At least one of those times is as a volunteer, as I commonly pass about two vacation weeks each year flying as a volunteer pilot for Kenya Wildlife Service over the Tsavos national parks, a glorious tract of Nature, spreading across 22,000 square kilometers, and populated with elephants, giraffes, zebras, buffalos, impalas and many other species of wildlife. It is my understanding of what heaven ought to be.\nThrough these years, I have kept vigorous in mind and body. In mind, I have continued to study passionately, especially keeping up with developments in biology and cosmology, and the poetic wonders that these “hard” sciences are revealing on an increasingly frequent basis. The awareness that all living creatures, literally, are made of stardust is a glorious discovery (all elements heavier than lithium necessarily would have had to been synthesized in stars, and those heavier than iron could have been synthesized only in a super-nova). This, and other understandings of the universe (or multiverse!), is very compelling to me. So are the discoveries at the micro end of the cosmic scale, and I have made great efforts to learn molecular biology, some for its own sake and the great fascination of have in learning, and some for a practical application. I have been helping Kenya Wildlife Service build a new DNA forensic laboratory in Nairobi in an effort to suppress bushmeat poaching.\nI also keep my body in shape with regular physical exercise, including three-mile jogs about three times a week. I used to perform a Marine Corps physical readiness test on myself once a week, and until about five years ago, could pass the standards established for active duty Marines age 40 to 45.  Then I had a bout with prostate cancer.  The treatment went well, but the radiation caused some “collateral damage” to my colon and I had to back off the exercise somewhat.  The body is the “temple of the spirit” and I’m keen to keep my spirit’s temple in good order.\nMy education has made me aware that I am part of Nature. Thus to live in accord with Nature I must live in accord with myself. No inconsistencies. A carbon atom is a carbon atom, no matter if it is on the left side of my brain or on the right side of Alpha Centuri. DNA is DNA, no matter if it is found in a cell on the edge of my ear, or the cell of an elephant’s ear, or the cell of a black-eyed susan growing out by my mailbox. Nature is one. Life has a common origin.\nI agree that determinism is an important part of the universe, but I am not certain it is the only part.  That said, I’m uneasy with the Epicurian random “swerve.”  Physical processes conform to inexorable requirements of Nature. Effect follows cause, all the way back to the Big Bang.  Nevertheless, there is still the question of free will. If our will is pre-determined, then we are not truly responsible for what we do. Such a premise disturbs the entire fabric of jurisprudence and justice and undermines concepts of accountability. I am hoping study of stoic philosophy may help me resolve some of this apparent contradiction.\n', 1, '2020-11-29', 1, 0, 0, '', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', 0, 0, '', ''),

A pandemic I was not prepared for led me to a philosophy I didn’t have a clue existed until one morning in late April of 2020. It was yet another morning of moving in a fog, brushing my teeth while thinking, “How is this our reality right now? How am I to react? None of this can be real.” At the same time, I was listening to a Christian podcast, which is common for me since I have been a practicing Christian since I was sixteen years of age. I cannot recall anything else that was said in that particular episode. All I can remember is suddenly snapping to attention as the host paused for a few moments, having gone on about the pandemic for a bit. After the pause, he said, “I’ve been looking into Stoicism.” At that exact moment, I wondered what that meant. I don’t know why those very few words stuck out to me, why I heard them when I had stopped listening several minutes before, but what I did know was that, if it was going to keep nagging at me, I had better do something about it to sate my curiosity.\n\nBy that evening, I was on Google, searching out articles and books, hoping to find something that would give me a clue and would also be interesting. I stumbled across “The Little Book of Stoicism” by Jonas Salzgebe. As soon as I started reading this book, I couldn’t stop. I finished the book very quickly and immediately sought out books from Epictetus, Seneca and Marcus Aurelius. I have been practicing ever since, continuing to deepen my knowledge and practice. Stoicism excites me. That is the simplest way I can put it. I couldn’t believe that there actually is a way to be happy and content in a life and world filled with chaos and discomfort. \n\nAfter joining a few Facebook groups involving Stoicism, someone posted about the Stoic Mindfulness and Resilience Training 2020 course that was being hosted by Donald Roberston. I raced to join that course, knowing that I would benefit significantly from learning about Stoicism in a course structure. The course itself was completed only a few days ago and I already have learned several ways to be more mindful and more prepared to handle whatever may come my way. The meditations, the view from above, all of the tools that were offered in the course not only sharpened my ability to pause between stimulus and reaction to choose the appropriate reaction (or non-reaction), but it gave me a hope I had not thought possible. I had thought I was going to have to figure out a way not to let depression and anxiety cripple me until the day I left the earth. To find out that one can be content in what they have in the here and now was mind blowing to me. Stoicism has been life changing for me.\n\nSince I have just started in my journey to creating momentum, I’m seeking and learning the tools I’ll need to do so. I have seen some effects of it already, strengthening me a bit day by day. It’s given me the tools to make an effort to look into the things that distress me and try to deal with them in a Stoic manner. I am able to analyze my thoughts and feelings without dwelling so hard that I fall back into bad habits. This is already leaps and bounds ahead of where I was over a month ago when I first started this journey. I would only dwell and dwell and dwell and never come to a resolution; I’d just wallow in the terrible and anxious feelings that the situation evoked in me.\n\nI will keep striving forward to build on that momentum as long as I live, to live in accordance with nature. Even in my limited knowledge of philosophy, it didn’t take long for me to figure out that Stoicism is one of the most practical philosophies.\n\nI had studied a little bit about philosophy here and there. I came into contact with Ayn Randian Objectivism the most before Stoicism, but in the end, I did not find Objectivism to be as cogent and helpful as Stoicism. I would consider myself to be a Stoic now, even though it’s only been two months. I come to this conclusion merely by the fact that I don’t just read or learn about Stoicism, I live it. I enjoy employing what I learn immediately into my everyday life.\n\nI am taking this course because I want to understand Stoicism at a much deeper level and alongside people who have been practicing and learning for a lot longer than I have. I also am interested in the history and theory of Stoicism and I still cannot get enough of learning, reading, and hearing about Stoicism. Taking this course feels like the next step in my journey to living a much more Stoic life, day by day. I also find that I learn better in a “classroom” setting, whether it be online or in person. \n\nThese days, since I’m at the very beginning of my Stoic journey, I feel like my actions and my mind match my philosophy often and not, all at the same time. That’s a very confusing way to put it! What I mean is, since I’m learning Stoicism, I think about it all of the time! I want to consume it and learn it and put it into practice and become my best self. So, naturally, I’m consciously paying attention to put what I am learning into practice. At the same time, this also helps reveal that there are a lot of moments where my mind and actions do not match my philosophy because I am still learning it.\n\nUntil I’ve practiced a long while, I will have lots of times where my mind and actions don’t match up. Of course, I’ll still slip up in the future. The goal is just to not let that happen so often after doing this for so long. I look forward to that at the same time I’m enjoying the here and now and learning.

I had a first meeting  with Stoics in my university courses although not so meaningful  for my existential choices. It has been some years ago, around my retirement, that I had chance and time to read and examine more deeply the principal works of the founders of Stoicism; I red a lot about Seneca, Marcus Aurelius, Epictetus, and several  books of modern English and American authors who wrote about that.\nFirst of all I want to tell you about an important point: English is not my native language, but I have no problem in reading and understanding the language;  I usually read and I’ve red several books in English; less good  is my speaking or writing (as maybe you can see).

I’ve examined  these theoretical systems, finding in each of them an answer to the questions that human being since ever try to answer to. But really my position is not so  definite,  if you think of  them as  absolute philosophical systems .  I’m not able to join totally to one of them, since to me is less important the total system than how your faith influence your real way of living, I mean the morals choices of your life. That’s the reason why  I ‘m very interested in Stoicism, but specifically  in the part related to morals. In conclusion among those philosophical systems I think to be closer  to deists. \n\n4)	Are you a member of a religious faith? If so, which and for how long?\n I’ve been  brought up according the principles and in the environment  of Catholic religion, the religion of my family and of the people who were in charge of my education.\n\nCatholicism is the religion of majority of  people in my country, although most of them are not practicing or they participate to celebration just  formally; so I myself attend religious rites in social occasions or circumstances.\n5)	Have you studied philosophies other than Stoicism? If so, which?\nI studied philosophy at university for four years obtaining a  Degree in Philosophy, which let me to teach Italian and History  in high school in Italy for forty years. Really I didn’t use to teach philosophy, but Italian language, literature and History. So at university I had to study the main philosophical currents in my courses of History of Philosophy. \n6)	Do you consider yourself to be a Stoic?\nWell, it\'s a very interesting  question to answer, and I’d like to share with you my thoughts on this. Through my studies of history I concluded that most of the morals principles and practice of Stoicism was absorbed and borrowed by Christian doctrine  at the birth  of Christianity; there happened  a kind of evolution or merger from ancient and pagan  religion to the  Christian one, transforming and arranging it to the new context.  Very often reading about Stoic philosophy and their  practice of life I am surprised of how many similarities with Christian morals there are; and – as I mentioned before – since I’ve been educated in Catholic environment I absorbed those principles. So in this sense  my moral way of living may be  similar to the Stoics at least theoretically. \n7)	What you want to get from this course.  \nWhat I would like to get from this course is to obtain more structure and knowledge about Stoicism, but also to meet and discuss  with others these topics; ultimately I’d like to share my ideas and opinions about some points or practice of Stoic philosophy. Although Mr. Wiegardt told me that it will not be possible in the S.E.S. course I do hope that I might find some people to talk about these topics. \n', 1, '2021-02-16', 1, 0, 0, '', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', 0, 0, '', '');

Most of my family were doctors, they were hard working, honest and loving, and I had an absolutely wonderful childhood. My maternal Gandmother was a big inspiration for all of us, she was a children’s doctor and saved many kids’ lives. She treated children with respect, like adults, and had a great sense of humor, so her patients loved her to the moon and back. I loved her because she was always optimistic, cheerful and humble, but at the same time had queen-like gace and could solve any problem. I wish I could have a profession that I love and the strength to always march forward in a harmonious manner like her, but right now I feel lost and a bit depressed. In fact, I was always a bit confused about what I’m supposed to do in life. \n\nAs a kid I was more inclined to arts, but my parents sent me to a  science-focused school. I wasn’t good at math, chemistry or physics, so I struggled and often felt down. The teachers liked me, they said that I am smart and have great potential, but some subjects I just couldn’t make myself understand. I’d spend time trying to figure it out, but eventually would get stuck and just sit there alone, feeling like I’m hitting a wall. That was not fun, especially because I knew I wasn’t stupid, but it felt as if I had a locked door inside my head. Eventually, my parents realized that I needed help and asked my Grandpa to help me out with Math and Physics and another tutor - with Chemistry. Not only did I get better, but I learned to enjoy the subjects that seemed dreadful for years before. I am very grateful for that experience because it showed me that if you’re stuck and can’t figure out how to get out - there is someone who can help. My Grandpa was a wonderful man, he was an engineer and a boxer. He’d always work out in the mornings and I often joined him, and he taught me some boxing too. Grandpa was one of the most equipoised people I knew, and during our Math sessions he never got impatient with me and explained the subject calmly and peacefully. At the same time, he could not tolerate injustice and nasty behaviour, and there are a few stories of him scaring away bullies on the street, leaving them with a black eye or two. I wish I could be as strong and simple and kind as my Grandpa.\n\nMy family was not religious, and not many people were in post-USSR Russia. Instead we cherished honesty, kindness, simplicity, friendship, and hard work. Technically, we were Orthdox Christians, but practically I didn’t know much about it.\n\nAt 17 I left Russia and moved in with my Father at Salt Lake City (my parents divorced when I was a baby). My Dad was Russian and never really assimilated here properly. He was a very sweet and gentle man, and I think that sometimes people took advantage of him. At the time I felt he was weak and wasn’t really impressed by him, but now, after he passed away, I think that being kind and gentleman-like is more valuable than being aggressive or inconsiderate.\n\nIn America I studied first at College and then - University. In the beginning I decided to major in Film. Actually, I never thought I’d do film, but I simply could not come up with anything else. I did not want to be a doctor like most of my family (probably just because of a teenage rebellion), and I couldn’t hear any other calling. So, I remembered that it was a lot of fun making movies with my friends back at school, and I thought, why not make that a profession? My Mom didn’t think this was a good choice and warned me that Film industry is no place for a girl. It did, in fact, turned out to be too stressful for me, so I paused my Film studies and went back to working on the Generals. \n\nAround the same time I got into psychedelics. It wasn’t anything too crazy, but I did have some interesting experiences. I think it was rather a good thing, although I’ll probably never tell my Mother about it. I was able to see my life from a different perspective and break out of some prejudices. I was able to pull my attention from the superficial and focus it on the main question: what is the meaning of life? I could not answer that on my own, so I decided that I should learn Physics. I turned to science probably because I wasn’t brought up in a strong faith. I figured that Physics researches fundamental laws of nature and it must give answers to fundamental questions of life. I still wasn’t good at science, but I was so passionate that I pushed through it (turned out, doing Math on acid was a lot of fun). However, it didn’t take me too long to notice that science only tells us “How”, but not “Why”. \n\nI was disappointed in Physics, but kept studying and trying to find out the answer to this “Why” on my own. And then it hit me: maybe I don’t know why negative and positive attract, but at least I know why all people do what they do: they do it for happiness. People drive cars, and go to work, and study at school, and eat, and sleep - all because they want to be happy. And they get most happiness when they experience love. So, I thought, love and affection are the meaning of life and somehow it must be the basis of everything. \n\nAround the same time I met a group of people who practiced ancient Indian philosophy - Gaudia Vaishnavism, a.k.a. Hare Krishna. As in every philosophy/religion there are many styles and many branches. These people practiced a very traditional version of Vaishnavism without the New-Age trash. This philosophy is based on the Vedic scriptures that say that consciousness is more substantial than matter, and behind every area of life stands a certain personality. So, there are many god-like personalities who govern everything. However, the main God does not have any responsibilities, He doesn’t have to do anything, He just is, and He is the personification of happiness and love. So, happiness is a person. That person isn’t stagnant, He is dynamic and always new, and everything exists just because He wants it to exist. That’s “Why” everything is as it is - just because He wants it to. When I heard this explanation I thought that maybe this is not true, maybe there is no God, but if these people think that there exists a personification of love and they worship that - I’ll be very happy to join them.\n\nI started coming to their programs and learning more. I learned, for example, that because God is the kindest and most loving being - everything that happens is actually good, but you can only see it as good if you give up your selfishness. I learned that body and soul are separate, that soul is indestructible, that there is karma, and many many other things. Anyway, I really liked that someone believed that love was at the center of existence, and I also liked these people. They seemed to be really cool. They believed in something higher than themselves, but that didn’t make them weak, boring or overly sentimental. In fact, they were the most bad-ass people I’ve met and they practiced what they preached.\n\nSoon after I turned 21 my Father passed away unexpectedly and I moved into a small temple in Salt Lake. I took initiation from my Guru in India and continued going to school, finishing both Physics and Film degrees. After graduation I decided to visit holy places in India. A film crew of Russian Hare Krishnas invited me to join them for shooting Maha Kumbha Mela - the largest gathering of people in the world. It’s a spiritual festival and is a bit crazy, but very interesting. I agreed, and spent three months in India, running around with a camera. After that the same guys invited me to Thailand where they had a joined temple and media studio. I lived in Thailand for about three years, trying to practice spiritual life and to learn something about film. Besides producing flat-screen spiritual content the studio created immersive 360-degree projection structures and videos, so, I made promo videos for their company too. \n\nThe Russian/Thai company wanted to come to the US market, and they joined with my friends in Salt Lake, starting a US branch of the business. I came back to help them and to see my friends. Unfortunately, if you mix crazy Hare Krishnas, technology, preaching, and business - difficulties arise, and after a couple of years the company divided into Russian and American parts. It was a bit of drama, and to be honest, I was very upset to see this divide. I stayed with the US devotees.\n\nAfter some time the new company divided again, and one of the devotees bought out the business from the others. Everyone stayed friends, but it was sure a lot of drama. Since then I’ve been helping the company because the person who bought it out was my feyonce. We’ve been working hard for the past 4 or so years, and this winter I realized that I can’t do it anymore. My feyonce is still running it, and it’s getting better and better, but I am kinda burned out. The purpose of the business was to support the temples and preaching, and we’ve done a lot of donations. \n\nThis inside drama and non-stop work of the past 10 or so years left me a bit disillusioned and tired. My pink-colored glasses are cracked. With our Guru gone there is no one I can fully surrender to and I have to learn how to stand on my own feet. I want to keep my faith alive and take everything as a blessing from the Lord, I want to focus on the good qualities of my friends and to love my fate, and I want to “dive deeper into reality” to re-discover the beautiful undercurrent.  But I am feeling stuck, like I did back in highschool, and need help.\n\nNow a bit of complaining: I feel quite lost and don’t know what to do with my life, I don’t have a lot of energy anymore and I don’t have the teenage excitement. I’m also very shy and don’t have much confidence. I’ve spent my adulthood living in the temples and am afraid of the outside world. I want to go back to film, but I’m afraid I am too old and stupid to do it. I want to go in my own direction and follow the ideals of my family and my faith, but I am struggling to even get myself out of bed. I have no motivation, I’m always in a gloomy victim mood. \n\nI heard about Marcus Aurelious from my Hare Krishna friends, and have been interested in it since. In fact, we all got slightly obsessed with Stoicism, for its practices are a lot like ours. This winter I stumbled upon Stoicism on Fire podcast and absolutely loved it. I’ve also listened to Marcus Aurelius’s Meditations audiobook. I know that I can find much inspiration from the Vedic texts and from my Guru’s books, but it feels painful to study them because it reminds me of how enthusiastic I was in the beginning and how down I am now. I know this will change with time, but meanwhile stoicism is a huge inspiration and I hope it will help me to crawl out of the hole.\n\n\nI think this answers most of the questions listed on the website, but I’ll go over them again:\n\n1. How long you have been interested in Stoicism - About a year or two.\n\n2. Any books you read on Stoic philosophy. If any, please list them - Meditations.\n\n3. Would you call yourself an atheist, agnostic/skeptic, deist, theist? - Theist\n\n4. Are you a member of a religious faith? If so, which and for how long? - Hare Krishna, 10 years.\n\n5. Have you studied philosophies other than Stoicism? If so, which? - I haven’t studied any philosophy in depth except Gaudia Vaishnavism. I know basics of Buddhism, Chistianity, Jainism.\n\n6. Do you consider yourself to be a Stoic? - I don’t consider myself a Stoic, but I’d like to become one. I am Russian though, maybe that counts for something :)\n\n7. What you want to get from this course. -  I’d like to get past my insecurities. I am very shy and vulnerable to criticism. This interferes with my life, and to be honest, I don’t know what to do with myself at this point. I know what I want, but I am too scared to fail. I want to learn how to see everything as the will of Providence and to stop whining. I want to be actively contributing to the organic whole of the world.\n\n \nThank you for your time,\nElena D.\n\n', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, '', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', 0, 0, '', ''),

My essay is below.', 'Application Essay for the School of Essential Studies. \nJune 21, 2020\nJoshua Z. Goldenberg, ND\n\nMy name is Joshua Goldenberg. I am in my late-30s, a busy working professional, a father and a husband. For most of my teenage years I was fascinated with philosophy and particularly drawn to the works more heavily focused on reason/rationality such as Bertrand Russel, Objectivism, and the like. Perhaps it was not too surprising then that I gravitated toward science. I majored in Molecular Biology at university and was a couple classes shy of a philosophy minor. \n\nAfter a short stint of “doing science” after college I realized that benchtop research was not for me. I did some serious soul searching and found myself traveling abroad for a year working on farms and backpacking. A trite, but productive, ‘finding myself’ trip. I found some direction while traveling and landed in a natural medicine university where I thought I would best be able to integrate science and healing. A more balanced approach I thought and one that would not chain me to a basement lab. So, through a somewhat circuitous route, I eventually became a clinician, although, somewhat ironically, I now spend most of time in research and teaching. \n\nLife then got very busy. Honestly, the past ten years have been a blur. I worked hard through 5 years of graduate education to earn my degree to be a clinician. I started a practice, got married, had a kid, bought a house. Things were wonderful, but busy, and moved at the speed of light/life. \n\nLast year I had a bit of an early midlife crisis and began to look around. It was almost like I had blinders on all these years and was racing down a track to achieve my goals. And then I did. And I wondered where I was. I was very happy with my life but while I was very productive over the past 10 years I didn’t have time (or so I thought) for it to be a thoughtful life. It began to feel like a bit of treadmill. A happy one. But one without introspection. I hadn’t really considered the important questions in life since undergraduate philosophy classes. \n\nI grew up orthodox Jewish although I left it when I was a teenager. Since then I was jaded and conflicted about religion. I oscillated between Jewish traditional, agnostic, and atheist. I think I tried out every type of synagogue there was: orthodox, conservative, reform, reconstructionist, jewish meditational etc. I even tried out churches and started meditating and reading about Buddhism. It never felt right though. It always felt forced. I seemed to ask the same questions over and over and over, but I never seemed to make any headway. Literally. I have reviewed old journal entries and I was literally asking the same questions for over 10 years without any apparent progress. Then this year happened. \n\nIt seems like after years of stagnation I was finally ready to learn new things and open myself up to new experiences. I discovered Unitarian Universalism and began attending services, something my prior self would never have imagined. It seemed to provide the ritual and community I was looking for without the dogma. Faith without creed is a phrase they use. The introductory ‘hymn’ at our local church welcomes in the Pagan, Atheist, Jew, and Buddhist. I’m still trying to find my footing and it is too early to identify as a member of that faith, but it is the most progress I have made religiously in over a decade. \n\nThen, as if that progress was not enough, in this remarkably productive period that the pandemic has become for me, I discovered Stoicism. I believe the first book I found was one of Ryan Holiday’s but I then turned to others: Epictetus, Seneca, and Marcus Aurelius. I downloaded Stoic apps and podcasts. I devoured The Daily Stoic, the Practicing Stoic, How to Think like a Roman Emperor, Ego is the Enemy, Stillness is the Key, Sellars’ Stoicism, A Guide to the Good Life and more. I couldn’t get enough. \n\nThe idea that negative emotions could enslave and rob us of tranquility but that this automatic reflex could, with training and reason, be dissected and the yoke thrown away spoke to me directly. I have always had an outside respect for reason and have struggled with anger and ego. The idea that with training I could use the former to temper the latter was fascinating and intriguing to me. \n\nAs I began to deepen my learning and read beyond the introductory texts I realized that I needed guidance. When things were well, I would be able to apply the teachings to my life, but as stress emerged, I found myself spiraling into anger, resentment, and ego. I was being triggered by all the things that would trigger me in the past. Had all my reading and journaling done nothing?\n\nOf course, I quickly realized that it was naïve to expect such a radical transformation in such a short period of time. It is a lifelong and worthy pursuit to better one’s self. Improving a little every day. The Stoic Sage is something to strive towards not, obviously, to become in a matter of months. But I did learn that I needed guidance. I needed mentorship. I looked in online forums but found the feedback disorganized and sporadic as one would imagine from the medium. I needed something organized and intentional. I needed, a curriculum and mentors. I needed the College of Stoic Philosophers. I was thrilled when I found it and after some perseverating decided to apply. \n\nI don’t think I consider myself a Stoic yet, although I am deeply interested and I think who I am would naturally fit well with this philosophy. What I hope to get from this course is more depth of understanding about this philosophy. I hope to go beyond the introductory materials, of which there are myriad now (this is a good thing and how I found out about this ancient philosophy, but is limited in depth). I hope to gain mentorship in the application of these epigrams and teachings to my everyday life. I hope to live each day as if it were my last. I hope to master my emotions, not let them be the master of me. I hope to be a better father and husband and friend. I hope to be a better citizen of the world. I hope to be a Stoic. \n\n\n', 1, '2021-02-22', 0, 0, 0, '', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', 0, 0, '', ''),

I was born in Buenos Aires city, Argentina, the 1st May, 1989. \nFirst of all I want to apologize for my English, I am a far better reader than writer.\nDuring both primary and high school I attended a catholic school close to my parent´s house, on the neighbourhood of Palermo.\nAfter school, I continued my studies in the University of Buenos Aires, taking a six-years-long Law degree, where I graduated on December 2015. I decided to study Law in order to become a politician and try to combat corruption in my country. You may not know much about Argentina, but it was amongst the 10 top wealthiest countries in the world for more than 70 years, receiving masses of immigrants from all around the world, specially from Europe (Italy, Spain, Germany, France,etc), until populism took over on the 1950s and decadence speed up in the 70s.\nBut when I was in the middle of my university studies I had a “personal crisis” as I realized politics were so dirty and I didn’t want to be involved in it. I also convinced myself my real passion was music, so I quit Uni for two years but then I resumed my studies.\nRight after graduating on March 2016, I flew to Australia on a “Working Holidays” visa: it was basically a one-year work permit. I lived in Sydney and in a small northern town called Mareeba, doing mostly construction and farm work. After my visa expired I travelled for five months in South East Asia and one month in Spain. It was an awesome experience overall, I improved my English and met people from around the globe. I always have dreamt of travelling and meeting people from different cultures.\nNow I’m back in Buenos Aires since 2018. My country is under strict quarantine so I’m taking this period of time to decide if I either want to emigrate to Australia (where my girlfriend just got a work visa and can now stay legally) or if I want to stay in Argentina and enter politics. I’ve been reading some cognitive-behavioral therapy  and Stoicism books, which both emphasized the importance of a value-driven life, and it´s making me reconsider entering politics and try to make a change in my country.\nEnough of my autobiography, and not wanting to bore you more, I will now proceed to answer the required questions. I may answer two or more questions on the same response if I consider it will be tidier that way. \nHow long have you been interested in Stoicism? \nAny books you read on Stoic philosophy. If any, please list them.\nI have been interested in Stoicism for a year and half approximately. I’ve started this journey with Massimo Pigliucci´s “How to be a Stoic”, which for me was a great introduction to the Stoic thought. Afterwards I read “Meditations” (Marcus Aurelius), “The Inner Citadel” (Pierre Hadot), “A guide to Stoicism” (St. George William Joseph Stock), and “Stoic Paradoxes” (Cicero).\nI am currently reading “Discourses” (Epictetus) and “How to Think Like a Roman Emperor” (Donald Robertson). I also attended an online Mindfulness course offered by Donald Robertson.\nOther related books are “Apology of Socrates”, “Phaedo”, “The Republic” (all from Plato), “Cato the Younger Biography” (Plutarch), “Rome´s Last Citizen” (Rob Goodman´s biography on Cato the Younger) and James Stockdale´s books and speeches on Stoicism.\nWould you call yourself an atheist, agnostic/skeptic, deist, theist? Are you a member of a religious faith? If so, which and for how long?\nWhen I was a kid till I was twelve maybe, I considered myself a Catholic Christian. Now I’m an agnostic, I live my life as if there is no God, but I don’t deny the possibility of existence of some kind of divinity. I am definitely not a Christian. \nI want to explore more on Stoic physics as I consider its views compatible with agnosticism and modern science.\nHave you studied philosophies other than Stoicism? If so, which?\n I was temporarily interested in Buddhism when I was around 21 years old. I read some Osho books but I felt disappointed after reading about the inconsistency between what he preached and how he lived his life. Besides that, Buddhism just didn’t feel natural to me and I also don’t believe that a state of “enlightenment” is possible or even exists.\nOn the other hand, I’m interested in classic libertarianism. Its motto is basically “unrestricted respect for the life project of others” which is quite consistent with Stoic philosophy.\nDo you consider yourself to be a Stoic?\nIt would be arrogant or hypocritical of myself to affirm that I am a Stoic. I am just a person that is very interested in this philosophy, because it has helped me see the world on a different way, it gave some certainties on this postmodern relative world where “everything is the same”.  I love it because it is a rational philosophy, which does not put much emphasis on esoteric or metaphysics.\n When I was a teenager I used to admire Socrates and read some Plato´s books and that helped made Stoicism feel very familiar to me.\nWhat you want to get from this course.\n I considered myself a methodical person, so I consider it a good idea to study Stoicism in a more orderly fashion, under the guidance of a person that knows more than me. \nI also think that one of the “Achilles heel” of Stoicism XXI century students is that, unlike Buddhists or Christians, we do not have “priests” or “monks” like them to trust for the interpretations of the available texts (which is just 1% of the original ancient texts), so it´s very important to get knowledge from anyone that already has studied Stoicism in a more serious way.\nThanks in advance and I am looking forward to start studying with you.\nBest regards.\nJorge.\n', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, '', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', 0, 0, '', ''),

Many thanks!', 'Know Thyself - An Evolution to Stoic Philosophy\nby Ernie Reid\nJuly 5, 2020\n\nI view life as an evolutionary journey, in mind, body and spirit.  I was not truly cognizant of this evolution until my late 40\'s, even though this evolution really began at a very early age.\n\nI was born in November 1963 in the rural coal mining backwoods of Pennsylvania, about sixty minutes southeast of Pittsburgh. My early childhood was less than desirable and I was removed from my biological family.  After being moved from foster home to foster home, I came to live with the people I would know as my adopted family.  It was during this time, I turned to religion as my life foundation.  As a young child and teenager, I fully embraced right-wing or “orthodox\' Christianity, alienating friends and relatives, by following the work of the strict moral teachings of fiery preacher from the pulpit.  Through my high school years and first three years of college, I continued to embrace Christianity, leaving the small Christian church for the local missionaries of the new Christ of Christ who followed the literal translations of the new testament of the bible. Eventually, I followed the belief\'s of my adopted father\'s family and moved to Phoenix Arizona to study at a fundamental southern baptist college to pursue my goal of becoming a southern baptist pastor.\n\nAll during this time, I began to develop doubts regarding each denomination and their belief that their religion was the only “true” religion with all other religions, especially eastern religions, being wrong or even cults.  This disturbing idea began to bother me more and more and I realized that I could not embrace any religion that believed they were the “one true religion”.  The concept did not make sense on a historical or philosophical basis, and, even at an early age, I had difficulty with blind faith.  I needed to make sense of existence and my role in this existence.\n\nHowever, the true catalyst was my discovery and realization of my sexuality. While redirecting my studies and Bachelor\'s degree of Psychology and Sociology, I began to doubt the beliefs of my religious convictions, as I began to discover my sexuality, I experienced the true distancing of those very religious from me during this time.  It was during this time, I was ostracized from the very thing I had built my life upon.  Because I chose to be “different”. I was no longer part of the spiritual community and family I knew.  Fortunately, this was the impetus that really compelled me to search for the meaning of truth and evolve my ideas of spirituality and religion.\n\nFor many years, I rejected  and denounced religion completely, closing alcohol and sex to fill the void of the life I had lost.  During this time, if I even thought of “religion”, it was a sense of betrayal and hatred.\n\nHowever, beginning in the 1990\'s I realized there was a void in my life.  I was in a relationship, a career in technology, in which I earned a Masters degree in the field and developed my songwriting and music production skills, yet I felt something was missing.\n\nA coworker at the non-profit where we both worked, began to talk about eastern religion and the concept of karma.  It was this employee who introduced me to “The Power of Now” by Eckhart Tolle.  This book let me on a daisy-chain path of self discovery and the distinction between spirituality and religion.  During this time, I practiced Zen Soto Buddhism for almost 10 years, where I began to understand “The Middle Way”, the importance of meditation, the Four Noble Truths, but mostly the translated words of Buddha to “take from any teaching what resonates within you”.  This has been the mainstay of my spiritual journey.  Eventually, I left my traditional Buddhist practice and began to travel through threads of thought, philosophy and spirituality, starting with the profound thoughts and words of Joseph Campbell and “Hero with a Thousand Faces”, that posited that there are recurring threads throughout most major religions and the concept of a hero\'s journey.  This concept of common ideas throughout religion really resonated with me  and  “extracted” religion and its role in politics and power from the concept of spirituality.  My journeys looks me to Taoism, Reiki, the poetry of Rumi, Mysticism, the concept of minimalism, which is not strictly a philosophy or religion, but is most definitely a way of life and living.  During this time, I became a member of the local Universalist Unitarian congregation, who not only accept my lifestyle, but also encourages spiritual questioning and growing, as long as it is done with love, compassion and that does not harm others.  I have been a UU member for about three years.\n\nAnother book that directly affected my evolution of spirituality was Life After Life, by Raymond Moody. This insight into the concept of death broke through the concept of heaven and hell, and christian beliefs of death and afterlife.  The ideas presented by Dr. Moody opened up the concept of a whole new view of life and death, and that religion was nothing but a human translation and evolution of whatever true spiritual entity that exists.  Religion, in my current understanding starts out as true spirituality, and through time, becomes mutated and corrupted by either ignorance, the need for power, or control. \n\nIt was though this breakthrough and the evolution and meandering through religions that led me to Stoicism.  I was surprised to find that Buddhism and Stoicism hold similar concepts of the importance of meditation and the use of a middle way.  Additionally, as I read more and more about Stoicism, that existed well before most religions, I find so many common thread of other religions within the teachings of stoics, causing me to wonder, did religions borrow these concepts in the development of these religions?  As I stated earlier, my believe that religion start with spirituality and evolves into a dogmatic religion, the concept of “starting where it may have begun” was alluring to me.  Over the past nine to twelve months, that I began to seriously study Stoicism.\n\nThe first book that I heard (I am an Audible addict, as I drive a bit to and from work), was “How to Be a Stoic”, by Massimo Piglucci, which introduced to the concepts of Stoicism and the works of Epictetus.  From this book, I decided to immerse myself into Stoic writing.  This led to the listening of  “The Practicing Stoic” by Ward Farnsworth, “The Tao of Seneca”, compiled by Tim Ferriss, the classic “Meditations” by Marcus Aurelius, “How to Keep Your Cool”, by Seneca, :Stoic Meditations” by Mark R. Smith and “The Enchiridion & Discourses”, by Epictetus.\n\nI currently consider myself a Buddhist-oriented Universalist Unitarian spiritualist on a lifelong quest.  I read somewhere in my readings that stated that one should never call oneself a stoic, because one can never live up to the stoic beliefs, but rather a follower of stoicism.  i may have misunderstood, which, would be a very apt reason to take this course.  \n\nI was led to this course indirectly by a search for Stoicism and Religion, as I still have unresolved reconciliation issues regarding where Stoicism falls between philosophy and religion.  I found the Traditional Stoicism website, created by Chris Fisher, who attended The College of Stoic Philosophers.  Based on the website, I believe that your courses may also assist me in my spiritual evolution.\n\nI would like to take this course in order to understand Stoicism as a philosophy.  Just as with most all religions and philosophies, concepts are mutated and dogma is created and segmented to individual interpretation and belief over time. As a person who typically studies and learns on my own, I believe I could use guidance to understand concepts and ideas within the Stoic philosophy.  I would like to be accepted into this class in order to learn about Stoicism and understand how to incorporate stoicism into my life not just as a philosophy, but as part of my spirituality.', 1, '2020-12-03', 0, 0, 0, '', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', 0, 0, '', ''),

In my earliest years, my mother was a paralegal and my father was a clockmaker, a trade he gleamed from his father-in-law. They opened a clock shop together that they ran for a few years until their bankruptcy and divorce. My childhood was a normal American experience, moving several times around suburban sprawls in Memphis, TN, my mother remarrying and having two more children, my father and older brother floating about in their own ways. For my teenage years, my father and older brother remained unemployed for about half of it, and my suburban life with my mother and stepfather was more or less stable. He was a patrolman for Memphis police, and she had become a private investigator and sometimes their work came home with them in unhealthy ways. Once I was seventeen, fighting with my parents became more and more frequent, often over things that none of us could control and my rage became uncontainable. I moved back to Jackson to live with my father and older brother in a much seedier environment, rife with drugs, poverty, and conflict. I figured my only way to save face and get out of my situation was to go to college and I chose to attend a college 7 hours away on the other side of the state, far enough away from the problems that come with unhealthy family ties. I think sometimes it is best to love from afar.\n\n	I fell in love with a girl and dropped out into my second semester, there were several problems with the college I was attending and some shady business practices, and I like to tell myself that I left because of this, but looking back at it, I believe I was just too immature to balance work, school, and a social life at the time. The girl and I got engaged and lived together for several years in different towns until the relationship fell apart and I gathered my life and moved back home to my mother\'s house around my 23rd birthday. The breakup was a volatile one and I didn\'t recover quickly or easily. This was when I found Stoicism. I had been reading about Cognitive Behavioral Theory and how it was inspired by the writings of the ancient Stoics, and sought to reshape my life into the person I wanted to be. I set my sights on a new town (Chattanooga) and researched it thoroughly and after multiple roommate arrangements fell through, I realized that it was impossible to save as much as I wanted in time to afford a decent apartment and was inspired by the Enchiridion to push myself past what I thought I could do. So, I took the backseat out of my sedan and created a sleeping platform with rolled up eggshells and memory foam as the mattress. I created blackout curtains, window covers, and made my car into the epitome of a stealth camper. \n\n	I lived out of it in the middle of summer outside my workplace and refined the style and method of packing and unpacking, preparing the bed at night and finding what I did and didn\'t need in life. I purchased a membership to planet fitness, and for 20 dollars a month, you can go to any planet fitness in the country and use their facilities, and since there is one in most towns, no matter where I went, I would have a place to shower and practice good hygiene. I moved to Chattanooga and made it my home, living out of the national forest, Walmart parking lots, and even the streets around my new job. I rented a room for a couple months, but barring that lived out of my car for a little less than a year total. After the accidental death of a close friend, I took the plunge and bought a van. I rented a space outside a friend\'s house and would work on it before work and on my days off, dragging supplies into it on rainy days and sleeping in it every night since the day I bought it. Little by little I built it out, walls with insulation, a bed, a kitchen. Once I felt like it could accommodate me long term I quit my job and traveled west to Arizona, leaving my car with my mother. After spending a good portion of the January and February in the desert, I made my way up California on the way to Portland and stopped in Sacramento to work for a few months and replenish my downed savings. I never made it to Portland and got a job offer in Tennessee, so I came back home in October 2018. \n\n	My reason for returning when I did was not a homesickness as my wanderlust was great at the time, nor was it the job offer I\'d received. It was a proverb I read, and I forget who said it, perhaps Seneca, but the gist was that one should travel with purpose and not simply wander. It was the analogy of a tree that really drove it home for me, the idea that a sapling tossing about in the wind may take no purchase, but one that holds firm in one spot may root and grow and shade those beneath it from the wind, sun, and rain. I feel that it\'s our duty as citizens of the world to repay our debt incurred from being allowed to walk this earth, and my time wandering was instructive to me, but any longer spent and it would have been aimless. It was time for me to set down roots and grow. \n	\n	On returning home to Chattanooga, for the first time, I found myself a part of a community and have seen a growth in stability. This last year and a half has not been the easiest, but it has seen more growth than any other period of my life. This I owe to the gifts and time that others have put into me over the years, from the wisdom of the Stoics to the tutelage of my teachers and grandparents, and I respect and revere all that have my brought me up to be the tender of my own garden, and all it required for that garden to flourish was to find the right patch of land. My current goals are to start school again with the purpose of getting a degree and have paid off my former college to attain my transcript in the last two weeks. I\'m looking to work towards a degree in Philosophy with a minor in Civics, with the hope to continue to higher education for a masters and possibly a doctorate.\n\n	As stated before, I became interested in the art of Stoic thinking and practice in 2016 and at the time of writing this, my interest has spanned for 4.5 years. My greatest sources of Stoic practice are the Enchiridion of Epictetus and the Daily Stoic by Ryan Holiday, of which I try to read the day\'s entry daily.\n	I also have read “A Guide to the Good Life” by William Irvine, “How to Be a Stoic” by Massimo Pigliuci, “Meditations” by Marcus Aurelius, and listen regularly to Simon Drew\'s podcast “The Practical Stoic.”\n\n	When it comes to faith, I consider myself a theist with a very similar view of God that the ancient Stoics had, and came to these conclusions many years before I had even heard of Stoicism. I am from the south of the United States and was raised Christian, specifically Southern Baptist, so my exposure to the religion and faith were from infancy. I would not consider myself a Christian, but I do uphold a portion of the faith. My issues are mostly with the religion and dogma and less of the faith itself, of which the Gospels still hold many concepts very akin to Buddhism, Sikhism, Shinto, and Stoicism, to name a few. My biggest challenge I face in speaking with Christians is the concept of belief being the driving force in their lives, when belief is only the first step. The life of a Christian should be devoted to the practice of the gospel, not the recitation of the concepts or simply the belief of Christ. I believe so it is with Stoicism as a philosophy, or really any philosophy for that matter, is that being a Stoic is less about the mantra, or the label, or the status of being a Stoic, but is the practice of virtue itself.\n\n	Thus, I find it difficult to call myself a Stoic. I have had people in my friend circles sometimes introduce me to others as a Stoic, and though I don\'t outright correct them, I suggest that I prefer to refer to myself as a student of Stoicism. Even though I keep it in my thoughts daily, and it aligns with my beliefs and helps shape my decision making, I struggle with the daily act of mindfulness and cannot for the life of me stick to a routine. I work about 50 hours a week in a high end kitchen and before Covid, my restaurant would serve anywhere from 150-250 people in the week to 400-430 on the weekend. On Valentines weekend, over two days, between myself and my partner on Saute station, we made 550 pastas to order, with only six burners. I say this, not to brag, but to show the high stakes environment I work in. I feel that I do a serviceable job at keeping a good temperament, but could always improve, for a true Stoic Sage would find himself in my shoes and never lose his temper. He would work in a quick, efficient manner, and even speak jovially if the time would allow it.\n\n	I think what I am seeking in the SES, and following that, the Marcus Aurelius School, is to complete my basic studies within the established texts before branching out into college again in Fall of 2021, with a set goal in mind and a stoic mindset before engaging with the study of other philosophies so that I might treat the knowledge I gain as just that, knowledge. Some knowledge can be serviceably wise, and can come from any source, but I think it truly takes the Stoic mindset to be selective of that which I consume.\n\n	What I think I will take from these courses most of all however, is the ability to create a healthy schedule and routine and follow it, because without that, I will truly fail that what I set out to achieve. One of the biggest lies I think we tell ourselves is that we would change if circumstances were different, if the environment was different, but in truth, I think that the goal of organizing my life to progress can and should happen now, while I still have a busy workload. If I can\'t finish this one course, if I can\'t truly organize my life now, even while working 50 hours, even with my social interactions and hobbies, then I am not prioritizing the future over today, I am not even prioritizing the day over the hour. Within this course I aim to find the willpower in myself to prioritize what I find important over the momentary catharsis of those things that lie at my whims and more importantly, to not stop as I have so many times, but to keep momentum indefinitely.\n\nThank you for your time in reading this and being open at getting to know and instructing me.\n\n-Joe Tucker', 1, '2020-12-11', 0, 0, 0, '', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', 0, 0, '', '');

I was born in Cincinnati, Ohio, and lived there for the first 18 years of my life. My father works in construction and my mother is a teacher. They raised me Catholic and sent me to Catholic schools for my education, but I became doubtful of religion in the second grade and have since identified as agnostic. Since I’ve had the mental capacity to think abstractly, I’ve simply never been able to approach religion with real belief. I’ve flirted with Catholicism and other religions (Buddhism in high school, Islam in college) ever since and consider religion very romantic and interesting, but I do not see myself ever overcoming the mental blocks to me seriously believing in one. I do approach life with a sense of gratitude though, directed at nothing else beyond nature. \n\nI studied history and anthropology at Loyola University Chicago and spent much of my time in college on research fellowships to Morocco, Italy, and China. In my final year of school, instead of moving on to a PhD program I decided to attend a more practical course of study at Georgetown University, where I received a masters in international business and politics. From there I went on to work for an oil company in Houston as a political analyst in their country entry/exit group. I came to dislike my work and Houston, and in 2018 I moved with my girlfriend to New York after I found a new job there in internal strategy at a bank. My girlfriend and I married, and she has since completed a degree and is now looking for work. \n\nI first became interested in Stoicism around 2012, when I first read Marcus Aurelius’ Meditations. I would go on to re-read that book several times over the next few years. I also read Cicero’s Stoic-influenced On Obligations, Viktor Frankl’s Man’s Search for Meaning, and some of Seneca’s Letters. It is possible that reading these books helped push me from my plan to merely study culture (which in the case of the regions I was interested, often meant studying poverty and corruption) and instead to something more action-y. I didn’t return to Stoicism seriously until 2018, when the responsibilities that I perceived in my career (getting a promotion), marriage (ensuring my wife’s success in her chosen career, etc) and to my parents (ensuring they would have enough money for retirement, etc), began to give me mild anxiety. I read Warn Fardsworth’s The Practicing Stoic and went through the Daily Stoic journal for a few weeks. In late 2019 I also went to a cognitive behavioral therapist a few times and found that that therapy is explicitly influenced by Stoicism. I returned to Stoicism during the pandemic, during which I’ve read How to be a Stoic by Massimo Pigliucci and How to Think Like a Roman Emperor by Donald Robertson. Now I’m planning to start A New Stoicism by Larry Becker.\n\nI have also read a good amount of other philosophy, primarily Nietszche, Thoreau, Tolstoy (especially The Death of Ivan Ilyich), and some Plato and Aristotle. I’ve also really enjoyed Peter Singer’s works on effective altruism (which I consider basically a methodology for fulfilling responsibilities to the world, but not much of a philosophy), and read A.C. Grayling’s recent History of Philosophy and have been skimming his The Good Book, his attempt at a humanist Bible. I also read a good deal on Buddhism while I was in high school, and in 2018 attended a 10-day silent meditation retreat in the Goenka tradition. I’ve also read some existentialism, like Camus, Sartre and Gary Cox, which I have found honest and interesting.\n\nOf everything I’ve looked at, Stoicism seems like the most fitting philosophy for my life. The Meditations has been my favorite book for years, and now as a maturing person I think it\'s pretty important for me to agree on a philosophy on life or else fall into unthinking materialism. There are many things that naturally attract me to the philosophy: the democratic nature of it enabling happiness to be achieved by anyone, the simplicity of it, its focus on philosophy as action/spiritual practice, its therapeutic nature that delivers almost immediate relief. It also jives with some traditional values that I was raised on - frugality, self-discipline, a sense of meaning through fulfillment of duties - that makes it feel like a natural fit. I also find it super interesting as a pre-Christian philosophy, since everything since 500AD feels like a reaction to Christianity somehow, either a commentary or a rejection.\n\n The challenge for me, and the reason for joining this course, is to try to go sufficiently deep into Stoicism, through education and through practice (I’m also going through Pigliucci’s A Handbook for New Stoics for exercises and am joining their local meetup group to attend their virtual events), to establish a strong foundation in the philosophy that I’ll then support with continued deliberate practice for the rest of my life as a Stoic. At this point in the pandemic, living with my wife and my thoughts in a tiny apartment in New York City for so many months, I think I have had an opportunity to reflect on my life and seen that I need more tools, and a better map. A philosophy that will help me get through the troubles of life and also give direction on how I should spend it, especially now given that I’ve reached a good point in my career and do not have the laser-focused, desperate need to climb the corporate ladder. \n\nOutside of work and reading philosophy, I also enjoy traveling, especially to where I have friends or in-laws, like in Latin America and Europe. I exercise regularly, usually at a gym before but now just at the apartment/running around the city. I love museums and the opportunity they offer to connect with past peoples by interacting with their objects or spaces. I take walks a few times a day in Washington Square Park, and usually spend a few hours reading there during the weekends. I also enjoy reading history and sci fi, and in the pandemic I’ve also picked up playing videogames for the first time in a few years.

I have been blessed throughout my life to never want or need the basic necessities in life, both physical and emotional.  My parents were caring and always provided a safe environment, although their relationship did not last beyond my second birthday.\n\nI spent the majority of my upbringing with my mother, who taught me to always tell the truth no matter how hard it may appear to be, and to always stick up for the little guy.  She taught me a profound sense of right and wrong, even if she had her own difficulties living up to those standards, as she battled depression and alcoholism for much of my adolescent life.  One time in elementary school, I witnessed a family friend being bullied on the playground.  I ran over and physically stopped the attack, which I was suspended from school for due to me and the bully “fighting.”  The bully never bothered anyone while I was a student there again.  That was one of the lasting lessons my mother taught me – protect those that can’t protect themselves.\n\nAt the age of 14, my mother and I moved to North Carolina to get away from the gangs and trouble in Los Angeles at the time; I had been expelled from a private school and was a bit lost.  I was eventually sent to a college preparatory military school in Oak ridge, NC.  During my cadet life at oak ridge, the experience further solidified the principles of justice and fairness my mother taught me years prior.  The school’s motto was, “I will not lie, cheat, steal, nor tolerate those who do.”  I fit in perfectly.  I participated in the color guard, drill team, and eventually became a member of the senior cadet leadership as Command Sergeant Major before graduating with honors and several college credits.    \n\nFrom 1999-2004 I attended San Francisco State University and graduated with a degree in Rhetoric. My course studies in ancient rhetoric and philosophy, including course focuses on Socrates, Plato and Aristotle, provided me with more of a historical context for some of the equitable principles I had been taught.  It was an invigorating and exciting academic exercise.  During college I was also a member of the parliamentary debate team, where I had the opportunity to hone my oratory and research skills, and which also pointed me towards law school.\n\nMy father is a lawyer, and I can remember always wanting to stay home from school so I could go to work with him.  One time when I was young, I was successful in my pursuit.  I convinced my dad I was sick (maybe I was, maybe I wasn’t – I really can’t remember) and went to a court appearance with him.  As I sat in the gallery observing that mornings docket, I was fascinated by the process, the spectacle and the importance of everyone in suits running around with seemingly very important tasks.  Little did I know that morning, I would be sitting in the same courtroom thirty years later.  \n\nMy father and I were not close while I was growing up.  As mentioned, I spent 2/3 of my childhood with my mom; the remaining third was spent with my father and his wife, Terri.  \n\n\nNow my mom never remarried, and chose not to date anyone during my childhood, which had the effect of forging a very close bond.  We remained very close up to and until her death in 2012.  After my mother passed in 2012, I went through a prolonged grieving period that had profound effects on my life- my marriage failed, my business almost failed, I lost my house, and I lost many, many friendships along the way.  It was the culmination of these experiences that ultimately led me to discover stoicism.  \n\nI have a vociferous thirst to learn and read.  One day in 2017, while I was reading two books, Buddhism is True and Sapiens, and still grieving the losses in my life (my mom and marriage, mainly), I was introduced to the concept of Amor Fati, which immediately called to my attention.  Love your fate.  Since my "fate" had taken turn after turn for the proverbial worse (or so I thought at the time), I wanted to learn how to in fact, love my fate.  I desired a path to happiness given the drastic divergence my life had taken from what I thought was the life I desired - the beautiful wife, the nice house, nice car, important profession, etc etc etc.  \n\nBetween 2017 and 2019 my life encountered more profound changes.  I was forced to sell my house to avoid losing my business.  I moved to a horse ranch in Wyoming without any surety that my decision to save my business (over keeping my house) was a sound one.  I transferred to a remote working structure and attempted to keep my business afloat.  I also experienced an unexpected break up, which forced me to move off of the ranch in Wyoming, which is when I began to learn more about stoicism.  \n\nAfter the first failed relationship since my divorce, I realized I had to make some changes in how I was living my life.  The impact of COVID-19 provided me the space and time to start learning what stoicism really is.    I first began meditating daily, to clear my mind and begin from a place of open mindedness and calm.\n\nTo begin my studies, I ordered and began reading The Daily Stoic, 366 Meditations on Wisdom, Perseverance, and the Art of Living; The Beginners Guide to Stoicism, Tools for Emotional Resilience and Positivity; and Meditations.  I have also begun listening to the podcast, Stoicism on Fire, which is how I was introduced to this school.   I also perform weekly stoic themed meditations by Jon Brooks via the app Insight timer.\n\nFurther, every day before I meditate, I read my daily stoic meditation and try to turn those meditations into intentions for my day and my life.

Not sure if this disqualifies me from the program.', 'Being born into a fundamentalist-lite Pentecostal family, "being a Christian" was the most important part of my spirituality from age four until about age 22.  What "being a Christian" meant was surety of a desirable afterlife, dedication to morality and service above personal gain, and a secure identity and community.\n\nSomewhere around puberty or just thereafter, I was hit with a rush of negative emotions the like of which I’d ever experienced.  I attempted briefly to talk to a trusted school friend, and was told “there are things we think about, and there are things we talk about.  I think….  I think these are the things we think about.”  And that was that.\n\nSo I endured wave after wave of unpleasant feelings, learning how to not speak of them, or to show others I was experiencing them, lest speech be unavoidable.  I developed an insensitivity to physical pain, and this ability to not show outward signs of physical, mental or emotional pain, when noticed by others, was called “stoic”.  \n\nThe unintended consequence was that I was unable to demonstrate the unbridled euphoria required to be considered a full participant in Pentecostal services.  This was very distressing, since access to heaven, as well as the secure identity and community provided by “being a Christian” felt under threat.  I considered many avenues available to me to counter this threat, and what seemed most rational was to fall back on the third pillar of “being a Christian”, which was morality, ethics, and rejection of personal interest in subservience to these ends.  \n\nI became quite the 17 year old philosopher.  I considered the ethics of sinful deeds, sinful words, and sinful thoughts.  If a sin was thought about, but not spoken or acted upon, was it still a sin?  Was the answer to that question the same for every sin?  Was it the same for every person?  Whom does sin affect more, the sinner or the savior?  If sin is a violation of the relationship between sinner and creator, why does the State so often get involved?\n\nAt university, these thoughts persisted, but for the first time I found other people willing to discuss them with me.  I studied history and mathematics, and from both fields, knew many double majors in philosophy, which pairs easily with both fields of study. \n\nUnfortunately, I experienced a crisis of identity.  While I still never doubted the truth of the Christian narrative: Creator God, Savior Jesus, Holy Spirit… I started to doubt other parts of the doctrine, such as the absolute infallibility of Scripture.  And that caused me to doubt whether I met the standards required to “be a Christian”.  Along with other problems more common to 20 year olds, I developed symptoms of depression, and was unable to complete my schooling.\n\nEntering the workforce in an entry level job with a lot of hours, I solved one problem (skipping church too much) by getting a job that required me to work every Sunday.  And funny enough, it worked.  For years I simply avoided thinking about the problems of identity and doctrine and afterlife and community that had plague my adolescence.  The depression didn’t get any better, and I got fired and/or laid off due to poor job performance over, and over, and over again.\n\nIn a fit of folly, I decided that I should return to school and finish my degree.  I started with one evening class.  It was a history class titled “Nero and the Roman Silver Age”.  The routine of going to class right after work suited me well, and I enjoyed everything about that class.  It was my first real instruction to Seneca, as we read several of his works over the course of the quarter, and I even wrote my final paper on “Letters from a Stoic”.  In fact, “Letters from a Stoic” was the most interesting thing I read that quarter (although Lucan’s Civil War wasn’t far behind), and is really where my fascination with Stoicism developed.  (This was in 2002).\n\nOf course, I got laid off soon thereafter.  I decided to go back to school full time, but I fared even worse than I did before.  I had finally hit “bottom”.\n\nBottom is a funny word.  I won’t dwell on it, nor the climb into a more stable and normal life.  It didn’t involve much Stoic study, just a lot of hard work.  I did eventually finish my degree.  I also came to terms with the phrase “being a Christian” and settled into a comfortable Deism.   \n\nBy chance, I met a man who lived in a Zen Buddhist Meditation Center.  He was interested in Stoicism as well.  For the next several years, I spent a lot of time sitting cross legged and focusing on my breath, listening to dharma talks, and reading books about Stoicism and even Pyrrhonism.  I never quite finished “Meditations” of Marcus Aurelius.  I almost finished “Stoicism and Emotion” by Margaret Graver (but the person who loaned it to me wanted it back when I was about 2/3 through it).  I read “Pyrrhonism: How the Ancient Greeks reinvented Buddhism” by Adrian Kuzminski, and even tried my hand at a few writings from Sextus Empiricus.\n\nIn the process, however, my comfortable Deism began to crumble.  Over the last few years, I would say that after struggling so hard to retain “being a Christian” and failing so badly, I’d rather not “be a …” anything.  Neither a Deist nor a Stoic nor an atheist nor an agnostic.  Maybe one day I’ll reattach an identity onto myself, but I’m in no hurry.  My experience is that beliefs change, but whatever identity is is more persistent.  Tying the two together seems to be inviting pain.\n\nWhat attracts me to Stoicism is the practices and exercises that separate the internal experience from external circumstances.  Christianity accomplishes this by dividing the world into two realms, the physical and the spiritual.  Buddhism accomplishes this through a disassociation from the “self”, culminating in an experience called enlightenment.  Stoicism is the only practice I know that attempts to accomplish this while remaining firmly in this realm and this body and mind.\n\nIn the last year and a half, much of my stability has been taken away from me.  I have ended a relationship, gotten laid off from a job, and moved to a different neighborhood.  I’ve started new friendships and new habits.  I’ve decided to go back to school.  The reason to take this course, right now, is to take maximum advantage of this period in my life to rebuild again.  A guided course through Stoic philosophy and practice would provide structure to a course of study I’ve been “meaning to get to” for awhile, but need now more than ever.\n', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, '', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', 0, 0, '', ''),

Martins\n\nI was born in Portugal, but I\'m more than just being defined as Portuguese. I always have a hard time starting applications such as this, so let\'s go like this: My story begins in October of 1986. I was born in a village in Portugal called Oeiras. When I was one year old, we moved across the globe to Macao, China. That\'s where I lived for 11 years until I was 12 and Macao passed from being a Portuguese colony to going back to China. \n\nThese 11 years shaped my mind, my life, and my internal world. I was growing up with a Portuguese background while being surrounded by Chinese spoken language, Buddhist temples, and the typical Portuguese "calçada". Macao was a hybrid of cultures, people, and values, and I learned the importance of tolerance, acceptance, and respect. It is funny that 25 years later I found someone who would accurately describe my perspective of the World. When I stumbled across Marcus Aurelius\' quote around how in the condition of being a man he\'s a citizen of the World, I couldn\'t believe how I could feel what such man just described. It was like he had better words than I knew to express myself.\n\nMy life has gone through many different phases, but one thing I know is how I kept on "searching". I didn\'t know what I was searching for, but I kept dwelling and losing my mind around, what others would call "philosophical questions", but I wouldn\'t perceive them as such. For me, it was a natural way to reflect, meditate, and find answers that would work as a compass in my life. I remember my "questioning" journey started when my parents split when I was 7 years old. Having an alcoholic parent* at such a young age where I had to take care of him presented me with such dilemmas. When I was taking care of him (putting him to bed, e.g.) I would always reflect on what would be my role as a child, a daughter, a friend, and so on. These questions, at such a young age, gave me answers to endure, support, and develop a set of values. Unfortunately (as well) I was sexually abused by a family member when I was 9. I\'m not writing these for pity or compassion, but to illustrate that since a young age I was living (from what I now know) are Stoic constituents of enduring what life as thrown at me.\n\nAnd why do I say this? Because of all that happen I had to choose at that age: become the best I could be, despite everything that might happen around me or become a victim of circumstances. I decided on the former. However, as time moved forward, I came to Portugal when I was 12. At that time I wanted to enter the Scouts but was denied access for not being baptized. This form of exclusion made me reflect on what is Religion, Spirituality. I remember believing in a "Universe" not a God. And I wanted to talk to my friends about all of these questions, but as 12 year-kids, they weren\'t buying it. During my teens, I became very lost. I didn\'t have a "normal" family, I didn\'t felt neither Portuguese nor Chinese. I lacked a family structure. One of my greatest blessings what that my parents loved traveling. With them being separated, I had the chance to travel twice as much. How wonderful that is! And because of that, I had the opportunity to see many different cultures and gain a sense of respect and connectedness. I now know that is a manifestation of the Stoic concept of how every individual is connected with the rest of the world. Until I was around 18 I had traveled 27 countries (or Special Regions) through different parts of India, China, Iceland, Thailand, USA, Italy, the United Kingdom, Morocco, Russia, Turkey, Tunisia, Malaysia, Europe, among others. What I saw was the concept of frugality, gratitude, endurance, and kindness. I learned so much about myself and others.\n\nI believe this was the thing that held me together during the chaos of my teen years. I have fallen into the alcohol trap during all my high-school years consumed by anger and rebellion. I was "searching" but not finding. "Searching for what?", you might ask. I can\'t answer that - perhaps Happiness and Peace? However, those years were unfolding I kept going to class and graduated as the best student in my year. Something inside me kept holding on to knowledge and to the idea that "if I\'m my best self in school, grades will follow. They are not in my control. What is in my control is the process and how I serve the process the best that I can". Don\'t ask how I made, because I still don\'t know. Looking back at those years, perhaps the Universe had different plans for me. What I do know is that those years, although blurry and dark and facing suicide in the eye, reminded me of mortality and how everything can be gone in a minute. When I was looking down at the edge of that building, done with the pain and broken family I had, I heard birds sing. And in that split second, I thought "birds will be here tomorrow, but I won\'t. I choose to stay."\n\nEver since I choose to live with the awareness of my own mortality.\n\nOne thing I clearly remember is questioning, as a kid, why did adults say that I was feeling wasn\'t real. Imagine this: every child goes through natural frustrations, even if they might be irrational. And I remember when my mom would say "don\'t feel that way, it\'s not worth it", I would think to myself: "but what I\'m feeling it\'s real, even if it\'s unreasonable. It is my perception and my sensations. They might be wrong but they are real". I know now that it doesn\'t align with what Stoicism defends about the impact of external things, but it pretty much aligns with Epicurism where all sensations are real and precede thought (Brun, 1959).\n\nWhat I know for a fact is that what always made me move is the desire to know the truth and the love for wisdom. As I keep on diving deeper into philosophy is how I return home.\n\nWell, time passed and after graduating I started working in the music business. I\'ve done a lot of different things within the music industry. I always dreamt of working in that specific industry, because music was my life. It was my safe place where I learned from others. Performers and bands became my teachers. Their words became my knowledge. I was, in the beginning, super happy and grateful for the opportunity. But with time, I became exhausted and the egos of artists and promoters led me to burnout.\n\nI left and decided to take a different route. I went for my Master\'s in Corporate Sciences. My thesis was evaluated with 19 points in 20. That still wasn\'t it. I got back into the music industry.\n\nWhen my son was born in 2015, my whole world shifted. I started looking within and discovered Stoicism in 2017 through one of Ryan Holiday\'s books. I felt understood. I discovered more about myself. And then I separated from my son\'s father.\n\nThis means that, consciously, I\'ve been interested in Stoicism for about 3 years. This is the list of the books I\'ve read, plus those that are pilled up to tackle next:\n\nBooks read:\nAurelius, M. (2020). Meditations: The philosophy classic.

Sometimes I struggle to define who I am because I am a multitude of things, but I\'ll do my best. One important thing for me is the definition of words and how they traceback. Only with that knowledge, it seems possible to make the right call. I\'ve never been baptized and never took religious classes. My parents always mentioned that with time I would be free to choose my faith. Due to cultural proximity, Buddhism became very close to me and I deeply identify with it as a way of life. However, religious practices weren\'t totally aligned with my way of being. I\'ve read a few books about different religions as a teen because I believe that all religions share the same goodness in heart, that we are all connected and we can learn from each other. But if I\'m not this, what am I? I know I\'m definitely not an agnostic or atheist, but I\'m still not sure. What I also know is that I believe in some superior order that unites us all and that things will unfold as they must. It is what it is. Perhaps it\'s still a lesson in the making for me. \n\nI know this essay is getting long and it\'s time to wrap it up. But I left, on purpose, the hardest question to last. "What do you want to get out of this course?", you ask. I find it always hard to answer. As you hopefully could see in this essay, I am always (1) looking for wisdom and truth, and (2) I want to impact and help others with Stoicism. I\'ve been working part-time as a coach and I\'d like to get more training for becoming a better version of myself and to help others as well. I\'ve realized that my coaching style is Stoic-based and I also realized that ancient wisdom is the roots of growth, wisdom, and happiness. It\'s not needed to have one hundred different frameworks of contemporary science when we can go back to the beginning. The wisdom still stands and, most of the time is where psychology and science come from.\n\nSo, what do I want? Wisdom, guidance, and truth. I want to learn from those who were here before me and whose knowledge will perdure long after we are gone.\n\nI hope this essay meets your requirements. Thank you for your time.\n\nYours truly,\nCarolina Martins\n\n\n* I don\'t have issues with my past - I\'ve accepted it and moved on - however, if possible I would like some discretion on topic.', 1, '2021-02-16', 1, 0, 0, '', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', 1, 0, '', ''),

I have been reviewing this statement nearly every week for 8-years, ever since I followed Covey\'s advice to "begin with an end in mind" (Covey, 1989). This mission helps me when times are tough by reminding me that no matter what I go through, the purpose and beauty of life always outweigh its challenges. Through this mission, I have a duty to make the most of who I am. As a Muslim by birth, I wish to express to God my gratitude for the gift of life. \n\nI would like to say that I encountered Stoicism through a brilliant epiphany. But rather, as often happens, it was serendipitous event after event. A quote, a book, a movie, all encouraging me to learn more. In the past few years, I\'ve engaged with various sources from Bill Irvine\'s "A Guide to the Good Life" to Donald Robertson\'s "How to Think Like a Roman Emperor" and Ward Farnsworth\'s "The Practicing Stoic". Additionally, I\'ve read some of Seneca\'s "Letters from a Stoic" and Marcus Aurelius\' "Meditations" through parts of Keith Seddon\'s "Stoic Serenity" course. I do not remember precisely how I encountered Stoicism. But I do believe that formally studying this philosophy is necessary for me to uphold my mission. Each day I\'m beckoned to many things—my professional work, my tumultuous health, my relationships. But, throughout my life I\'ve become increasingly aware of a profound question: does it matter what we do or what we have if we are not chiefly concerned with who we are? \n\nI was born in Champaign, Illinois to Iraqi immigrant parents. I\'m always inspired to think of their journey, arriving with almost nothing and working hard towards the American dream. When I was 5-years old, I was diagnosed with an extremely rare disorder called Hunter’s Syndrome. It’s degenerative, meaning every system and organ in my body breaks down and malfunctions over time. Growing up, I often couldn’t walk a block without running out of breath and I was more familiar with the hospital than the classroom. Yet, despite all of the challenges—over 20 surgeries now—I feel more alive than ever before at age 23. In fact, at the end of the day, I believe that my condition is my greatest blessing. Because, borrowing from Seneca, it has not only wrought in me "an improvement but a transformation" (Seneca, 2004).\n\nWhen I was 15, I underwent spinal fusion surgery. I went from walking semi-well to barely walking at all without the fear of debilitating pain. As I recovered, I became increasingly sedentary. I had no restraint in eating. "McNugget" could have been my middle name. So I grew heavier and unhealthier. \n\nAfter a series of serendipitous encounters with various movies, books, and blogs, I came to realize a remarkable truth about my health: unnatural living results in unnatural consequences. I began seeing my health as inextricably tied to my lifestyle—not solely determined, as I\'d been told—by genetics. I began researching what is known as "ancestral health", the domain of nutrition and fitness based on eating, moving, sleeping, and living in accordance with nature as much as possible. In a world filled with processed foods and manicured landscapes, chairs, and cars, ancestral health was a paradigm shift. I dove in, drastically altering my diet first and then as I lost weight and gained energy, my movement ability. I remember watching an inspiring video titled "The Workout The World Forgot". I was amazed as a man ran through the woods, climbing trees and lifting rocks, practicing martial arts, all with such graceful strength. I looked at my own body with its misaligned joints and coarse features. I breathed, knowing that my lung capacity was limited. I wondered, "is it possible that I could be like that man, even a little bit?" As I walked outdoors, I gazed on the natural world of Creation around me in awe. I realized that as human people, we were meant to be awe-inspiring too. Not only through physical prowess but through our capability to think, reflect, and choose to live well. \n\nI took the maxim of living with nature to heart. I foraged for wild edibles. I spent days walking outside, observing, listening, and trying to, inspired by the stories I read, live as one with all things. As I did this my body, my heart, transformed. After so many years of feeling like I didn\'t belong, in nature, I did. I even had days, many days, spent running shirtless and barefoot, climbing trees and lifting rocks, and practicing martial arts, to the extent that my 4\'10\'\' frame would allow me.\n\nOne day, during the second semester of community college, I sat on top of a dirt hill. Hands calloused and dirty, I examined a rough plant as I looked at the sprawling prairie around me. Beautiful. The sky was a clear blue and the midday sun shone on my face. Here I was, a block from my community college. I felt tranquil and alive. "Is this what life is all about?" I asked. I was 19 years old. After 15 years and over a dozen surgeries living with my condition, I finally felt I belonged in the world. In Nature, just being, just existing, was enough. In every moment, you feel connected to the great web of life. Striving to live in accordance with Nature had transformed me, physically, mentally, and spiritually before I even knew what Stoic philosophy was. \n\nYet, although I had healed physically and spiritually on so many levels, much of my time over the 3-years of training was spent alone. In nature, yes, among the birds and grasses. But, except for my family at home, without people. No clubs, no activities, not a single friend I could look to in high school, or, now in college. I had grown increasingly disillusioned and disconnected from regular society even while knowing I depended on it. But as I stood on that hill, I realized that the way I was living was not right. I could not continue to see myself as a victim and retreat into the comfort of nature. That is not our awesome responsibility as humans. I came to believe that we are not here to live for ourselves but others. All that we are, all that we can do, can somehow touch the lives of others. I realized I had to transcend my limitations and fears to grow strong to be helpful. \n\nI challenged myself to enter difficult social situations. I joined groups. I began practicing public speaking, winning awards, and eventually, being called to speak for various audiences from healthcare executives to students at the high school I\'d vowed never to return to. By my second year of college, I was convinced that being a public speaker and inspiring the world was my purpose. Finally! I knew why I had my health condition. So I could help others overcome their challenges too. I thought that my profession, building from my condition, was who I am. I could finally answer that dreaded question: "what do you want to be?"\n\nBut a year later, I was in dire straits. My business was going nowhere. I had used most of my savings and was about to throw away the opportunity of studying communication at the University of Illinois. It wasn’t until a very special person had the courage—and honesty—to give me feedback that I was channeled into a better way. At a time when I thought I had it all down, I was starting a health coaching and public speaking business, after all, he asked me this beautiful question: have you ever considered that you’re wrong? I considered the path I was on and realized that I was wrong; it was not the path to success. I believed that my profession was who I am. Then, when it failed, I saw myself as a failure too. Through my mentor\'s question, I learned that true success will come with real work not only ideals. So, I shut down my business ideas, podcast, blog, speaking, all of it.\n\nTo pay for my upcoming classes, I took the first job I could get—at a call center for auto insurance. At first, it was tedious and unrewarding. But I did the best that I could and began to transform. One day, we were called to work on a weekend that had originally been given off. It was blustery and snowy and I was comfortable watching a movie at home with my family. But, I knew I had to go. As I drove through howling winds, I felt resentful. Why me? I groaned. Then, the resentfulness began to melt away. With my hands gripping the steering wheel, I realized that if I could do this, if I could make myself go to this work, facing hundreds of rejections a day, I could do anything. I smiled the rest of the way and did that day\'s work. For the first time in my life, I felt that I was being a real man, not driven by passion, but by discipline and resolution—by strength of character.\n\nI carried that day\'s lesson throughout the remainder of my college years. I grew through many challenges—loneliness, depression, and the various struggles of my condition. Yet, by the end of my final semester, I had gone from Cs and Ds to straight As and a track record that enabled me to make it into a prestigious Ph.D. program at Olin Business School, St. Louis. I am about to begin the Ph.D. program this fall, 2020. \n\nIf I\'ve learned anything in my 23 years it\'s that the purpose of our existence is existence itself. I believe that our primary purpose is not to take or even to make but to be. Being is who we are and we will carry this through everything we do. I\'ve learned this from my religion and from the other great traditions I\'ve encountered—Buddhism, Daoism, Native American Spirituality, and of course, Stoicism. Islam means complete submission to God and I can see no better way to do this than to refine my character through any and every means possible. Although I prioritize my budding career and professional life, I cannot work in good faith if building my character does not take precedence. To answer the question beginning this essay, I believe that indeed, it does not matter what we do or what we have if we are not concerned with who we are. \n\nI seek to study Stoicism at this college to continue the transformation that has characterized my life. Although there are various resources to study Stoic philosophy, I\'m drawn to this college for three reasons. The first is to engage in a structured program. In martial arts, we learn the forms so that when we need to improvise, our body is ready. I don\'t yet consider myself a practicing Stoic. By internalizing the structure of Stoicism through your course, perhaps I could consider myself a practitioner. Secondly, I seek to practice resolution. Through your program, I can find accountability and feedback which is limited when I work alone. Finally, and perhaps most significantly, as I develop through your program, I seek to share Stoic philosophy with others. I am especially excited about the prospect of graduating into The Marcus Aurelius School after the School of Essential Studies. One of my greatest wishes is to be a positive role model, a mentor for others, to help them live a life of flourishing. So many, alive, and gone have done this for me. I believe it is my duty to do the same. I wish every person to learn, as I have, that our trials are there to transform us—as your motto states: ignis aurum probat, "fire tests gold". \n\nUltimately, we all have a limited time on this Earth. We all go through so many challenges. No one, not even me with my condition, fully understands the pain of another. We’re all lonely, afraid, sad, confused, and so much more, so often. Yet, each day, we wake up and keep going, because of those moments we have, even with a pandemic. I often wonder why I’m doing what I’m doing. Why do I have to sacrifice and work hard? Sometimes, I ask, what’s the point? Then I remember my mission: to live my life as a grateful expression. It’s because I’ve been given so much: wonderful people, beautiful sights, sounds, and smells, and the opportunity to, if only slightly, make the world a better place. By being my best each day, I strive to fulfill my mission to express gratitude with all my life, to my family, friends, country, world, and God Almighty.\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nCovey, S. R. (1989).

I was born premature and weighed only 1.53 kg (3 lbs 6 oz). I obviously do not recall the events of that early part of my life, but many family members have been very eager to remind me of the chaotic day that I was born, when they all rushed to the hospital, worried about the health of the new baby and of my mother.  Luckily after more than a month, I was allowed to come home to a tiny house just outside Montezuma Ohio. \n\nMontezuma is located in a rural, conservative county. I was raised in the Catholic church with strong values and a deep sense of right and wrong. I grew up with a very small group of friends;  I was not into sports, my recreation consisted of fishing and hunting. I was picked on a lot in school and suffered from depression, but going out into nature helped me to cope.  Being in the woods has always had a therapeutic effect on me, I feel connected to it in some way. I think this goes back to my earliest memories of walking in the woods with my grandfather. \n\nWhen I was a senior in high school, I tried to join the U.S. Air Force, I was a conservative Christian and wanted to serve my country. However, my heart beat was too fast to pass their medical exam. So I followed my friend to Hocking College, a two year school, to study wildlife biology. I really liked college. Unlike high school, there was no oppressive hierarchical structure of popularity. I could learn without fear of being preyed upon by jocks and bullies in the hallway. After completing my degree, I went to Ohio University and studied plant biology. I had now found my element. I really enjoyed learning about science and getting to practice it in a paleobotany laboratory. At this point, I really started to doubt my religious faith. I read the bible cover to cover, expecting the truth be evident, but this caused me to doubt further. By the time I graduated I was an agnostic Christian. \n\nI then left Ohio and moved to Canada for graduate school. I worked on my MSc. degree on Cretaceous age plants while also learning how to teach as a graduate teaching assistant. When I graduated from the University of Alberta , I was a very  different man  from the one who moved to Canada three years before. Teaching and giving scientific talks helped me to be more confident in a crowd. I also became more social, playing guitar with friends, going to parties full of scientists and enjoying a debate over a pint of beer. I also had shifted in my religious views… I was somewhere between an Atheist and a Deist, though I dared not mention it to my family.\n\nWithin a few days of moving home I had acquired a position as a visiting lecturer at Hendrix College in Conway Arkansas.  After teaching there for three years, I was hired full time as a lecturer and lab coordinator at the University of Central Arkansas (UCA). I still work there today teaching two courses in cell and organismal biology to freshman biology majors. I also work closely with graduate students, teaching them how to teach and getting them ready for lab each week. \n\nJust before starting my position at UCA, I married my wife Chrissy. We met online and after a year or so of dating she moved to be closer to me and found a job as a librarian, also at UCA. In June of 2016 our son Charles was born. \n\nShortly after the birth of our son, I ran across a book at a local book shop. It was the Meditations of Marcus Aurelius.  I had been reading about mindfulness and the title caught my eye and I looked it up when I got home. This led me to reading more and more about Stoicism. I then picked up William Irvine’s Guide to the Good Life, followed by the Meditations, the Discourses of Epictetus and Letters from a Stoic by Seneca.  Stoicism seemed to offer  something that I needed. A way of life. I was leaning pretty close to atheism by this point and while I was intellectually ok with that, I wanted some kind of system to help me make decisions, and to frame my life with.  I also have had anger issues and several other character flaws that I wanted to work on. I decided that I wanted to pursue Stoicism further, but I know that I am prone to making big plans but not following through. So I started a podcast, combining my interest in Stoicism with teaching. I decided to release it on Sunday’s as sort of a secular sermon and called it the Sunday Stoic. \n\nThe podcast has been great, I have been doing it for 3 years now and have chatted with many big names in modern Stoicism, William Irvine, Greg Saddler, Donald Robertson, Massimo Pigliucci and more. It has also kept me engaged in the literature, taking notes and thinking about how I might apply this philosophy to my life.  During this process I have read many books including  A Guide to the Good Life, How to Be a Stoic, The Fragments of Musonius Rufus, Plato’s Apology, How to Think Like a Roman Emperor, The Lives of Eminent Philosophers, The Practicing Stoic and others. \n\nThe study of Stoicism has also led me to reevaluate my beliefs. I want my beliefs about the world to reflect reality as much as possible. This has led to some trial and error as I experimented with returning to faith initially.  For example I joined Freemasonry for about a year. I really enjoyed their community and volunteerism, but too many members were racists or religious zealots. I recently found a home in the Unitarian Universalist church and have finally (at age 40) admitted to my family that I do not believe in the Christian faith any longer. If I had to label myself now, I would say that I am a religious naturalist or a scientific pantheist. I revere nature, but I am agnostic as to an afterlife or any intelligent power behind it. My current beliefs are outlined at the end of this paper. \n\nI have been a practicing stoic now for a little more than three years. In my study of Stoicism, I have also looked into Epicureanism, and a little bit of Aristotelianism. But Stoicism calls the most to me. This is what has led me to this college. I want to push beyond self study and work with others within a community of Stoics and grow deeper in my understanding, and more importantly in my practice of this philosophy. \n\nThe Cosmos, (God, Nature, the Ultimate, the One) is the source of all, and therefore worthy of reverence and study. From this study, humanity has learned that it is a conscious extension of the Cosmos. We are the consequence of, as well as component of, a web of cause and effect. From the Cosmos we briefly emerge, with a sliver of thoughtful independence, and to the Cosmos we eventually fully return. \n\nVia this cosmic connection and our own influence on the web of cause and effect, lie our immortality. We are the products of the laws of nature and as such are eternally bound by these laws. More specifically, we are beings of the Earth, related to every other known being, and yet set apart by the refinement of our ability to communicate, investigate, learn, and change. \n\n \n\n To live well in this world, I need to learn from it, this is the cultivation of Wisdom. From this knowledge it is clear that our species survives due to our ability to cooperate, we are social beings, we must live in cooperation, therefore Justice is my primary aim.  To live well I need to not only to share and work with others, but also to control myself if I am to become the best example of humanity that I can; for this Temperance is needed. To be wise, just, and temperate in the face of hedonistic passions and clashing worldviews, Courage is needed.  If these virtues are pursued and progress is made, then my eternal contribution will be a good one, I will, upon the end of this journey, be worthy to return to the Cosmos. \n\n \n\nWhere am I to gain this wisdom? Humanity has been seeking it for centuries. In science I can learn our most well supported understanding of the functioning of nature. From philosophy, how best to live as a member of a diverse society and pursue truth, beauty, and wisdom. From religion, the breadth and beauty of humanity’s contemplation of its place in the universe, as well as thanksgiving, community, culture, and charity. This pursuit is worthy so far as it does not contradict our best understanding of reality. Contradiction reveals either an incomplete understanding or an incorrect assumption. A belief in that which contradicts the laws of nature is tantamount to idolatry. When in doubt in any of these matters, it is best to hold no opinion!

Following this break up, my mother, my sister and myself moved into a council estate which can be described in the UK as a rough area to live in, surrounded by drug dealers and the negative, often violent consequences that brings. It is safe to say that we struggled often, however the memories I do have of that time are ones of a strong sense of family, which became the foundations for my current sense of duty and protective nature for my family and friends. \n\nAfter a few years of living in this council estate, my mother met a man who she later decided to leave Gosport with and move to a small little village called Upton, in the county of Cambridgeshire. From what my mother has told me, I did not take this well and thus began my journey towards constant internal and external conflict, I lashed out at everyone, distraught at leaving my home town, leaving behind my friends and most importantly, my father. When we arrived at this new village, I did what any upset child would do, I sulked, I threw constant tantrums and resisted every effort by my mother and her new partner to get me to settle down. I was a nightmare to be honest and continued to be so well into my late teens.\n\nAfter further breakups and toxic relationships, my mother began to suffer heavily from mental health issues and retreated into alcoholism and despair, as I was a young child at this point, I didn’t have a clue what to do, my older sister had already left to live with her boyfriend at this time and I was utterly alone, left to try and help my mother and myself with problems I couldn’t possibly of understood. This is where my life really begins to spiral, I feel completely useless, worthless, weak, ashamed of myself that I’m not able to help my own mother, this developed into serious anxiety and depression and my first coping mechanism, was video games. I played these from an early age like most children, but I took it to the extreme, wasting entire days and weeks playing games as I was not attending school due to my anxiety and depression. \n\nI thought I had found my cure, playing these games made me forget everything, they became my life-line for years, until reality began to hit home, I was a sickly kid, scrawny and pale looking from all those hours of being sat a desk in darkness only moving to eat some junk food or to use the toilet. This only worsened my anxiety when the days I did go to school, I began to lash out at people, I got into a lot of fights and at one point my school attendance rate was at 33%, I missed out on so much education and valuable skills. However, it was not all doom and gloom, there were days where I excelled at school, I found that I had an interest in History and Psychology which I did well in and enjoyed. \n\nHaving left secondary school at this point, I took a year off before going to college to study ‘Public Services’ which is a course designed for those who wish to join the Police, Armed forces etc, however my behaviour and attendance put a stop to that and so 2 years went by before I went back to college again, this time to do an IT course. I enjoyed this and was able to use all those skills I had learnt as a young child playing video games, I passed the college course with a sense of pride.\n\nI wish I could say that from this moment, I changed my path and ‘knuckled down’, however things would continue to worsen as I got into my late adolescent years as I began to experiment with drugs and alcohol, things would get so bad during that I often was admitted to hospital. At this point I knew I was at a crossroads, I would either die or end up in prison (I did later on in life, but on the right side of the bars) if I did not change.\n \nI had what you could call a ‘eureka’ moment and started my upward journey to personal development, I rid myself of all the drugs and other destructive habits, my family life improved dramatically, I started to work full time and things were moving well. It’s not been perfect and I’ve had a few slip ups, but overall I’ve made such progress and continue to do so, I would read constantly, mostly ‘self-help’ books, however this led me to discovering Marcus Aurelius’s Meditations and thus Stoicism. This was in 2016.\n\nAt first, I struggled to read it as I was constantly met with words such as ‘Logos’, ‘Providence’ and God, I have never believed in any god or religion, due to my personal circumstances and history, I was determined that there couldn’t be a god after all the hardship I faced. So there I left it, I never went any further than that until 2020, where the current COVID-19 situation and a breakup with my ex-partner led me back to Stoicism. For those 4 years, I was always interested in the idea of Stoicism, frequently watching the odd YouTube video on the topic, but that was as far as it went.\n\nI have currently read the main works of the great 3 Roman stoics, ‘Meditations’, ‘Discourses/Enchiridion’ and ‘Letters from a Stoic’. I have also read ‘Courage Under Fire’, by James Stockdale, ‘Ego is the Enemy’ and ‘The Obstacle is the Way’ by Ryan Holiday. \n\nThese books and the various podcasts I have been learning from has helped me in my stoic practises and exercises in general and in my role as a Prison Officer, I have been in this role for 2 years now and I can honestly say it is one of the best ‘testing grounds’ that I can think of in regards to the four cardinal virtues. To work with and alongside members of society that have committed some of the worst crimes thinkable and yet I am able to act in accordance with those virtues of Wisdom, Justice, Courage and Temperance.\n \nAt this stage of my life, I still consider myself to be an atheist, but I am very open minded and deep down I wish to believe there is something else. I am not part of any religious faith. Aside from Stoicism, I have not studied any other philosophy and I do consider myself to be a Stoic, just not the most informed and knowledgeable one. \n\nThis is why I wish to enrol onto this course, to expand my knowledge of Stoicism, to have a greater understanding of it and what it means to be a Stoic, I want to know more about the Logos, about Providence and God so that I can make my own decision and finally give myself peace of mind.\n', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, '', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', 0, 0, '', ''),

I am 23 years old and have been interested in Stoicism for a couple of years now but only now am starting to seriously look at learning more about Stoicism, especially as a way of life. A couple of months ago I broke up with my now ex-girlfriend. That event lead to me losing the house I was living in and a few other parts of my life that I didn’t realize I cared so much about. Finding Stoicism has helped me to adapt and change my focus to what I can personally affect in my life and what I have no control over. For this reason, learning about Stoicism as a way of life is very important to me. \nI have been interested in philosophy for probably around 10 years now. Throughout my time in school I have taken about 3 philosophy classes. 2 of them were classes that where an overview of all of philosophy but more specifically a lot of virtue theory. We covered some of the major philosophies like utilitarianism, hedonism, and virtue theory. We also talked about some of the major philosophers like Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle; Rene Descartes, Kant, Jeremy Bentham, and John Stewart Mills. Sadly, this class didn’t really touch on Stoicism much at all and I didn’t come into contact with it much. One of the people that I follow, Tim Ferriss, talked about it a bit but I never really checked it out until recently.  I took a class on ethics, but I haven’t taken anything in particular on stoicism. My favorite of the philosophies that I have studied, I think would have to be virtue theory. I really enjoy how at the end of the day any choice you make is only judged only by how you perceive your action when you look back on it.\nI have always had a hard time making choices for my future. I often get excited about something and then change my mind or get bored with it. I am hoping that I can use stoicism to help figure out how to guide my life in a way that I will be happy with when I look back upon it. A friend recently told me that maybe trying to find fulfillment in a career isn’t what I want. Instead maybe I need to find the lifestyle that I want to live in. I think that Stoicism lends itself well to that. Trying to find fulfillment in the present rather than constantly dreaming for the mysterious future that will be better than where we are now.\nI am currently reading How To Think Like A Roman Emperor by David Robertson. I have read some of Marcus Aurelius’ Meditations and some of Seneca’s letters but not very much of either of them. I have also read a lot of quotes but none specifically from any of the books. One of my favorite books is the Stormlight Archive by Brandon Sanderson. In it he explores how each characters flaws and the ways that each individual is able to fight through their different traumas. This book is almost what I would refer to as my Bible. The story it tells is one of struggle and hope and every time I read it, I get something else out of it. \nI am not a religious person. I grew up in a Christian household and most of my family believe in God but personally I am an atheist. I personally feel that there isn’t sufficient evidence for me to believe in any of the hundreds of religions that exist, and I personally cannot believe in a religion that has Hell as a place. People suffering because of their lack of faith forever is not something that I could ever get behind. I don’t think that religion is particularly important to an individual’s sense of morality and self. Logically I know that there are millions of people that use religion as the fuel for the way they live their life but I don’t think that is necessary. I think living in the moment and being present with a desire to do good is enough for most people to live a good life. The other part of religion that I don’t agree with is its tendency to make God the answer to hard questions. I consider myself to be a pretty rational person so asking and understanding why, is how my thoughts run. I love knowing why things are the way they are and how those things work so when those questions don’t get asked, or if they do the answer is God; I tend to get frustrated. \nI am not sure if I can consider myself a Stoic yet. I am consciously trying to practice Stoicism daily, but I am not sure that I am practiced enough to consider myself a Stoic quite yet.\nI am hoping that this course can help me to learn how to make choices that I can be proud of. For the past year I have been dealing with depression and anxiety that often hinge on where I will be in the future, how I will be, who I will be, and more questions of what my life will be like in the future. Stoicism really appeals to me because there is a large portion of taking out the worry about what that world is going to do and instead focus on what you can do. \nI hope that through this course I can expand my knowledge base on Stoicism and use that to help me in my own personal life. I have been dealing with mental health challenges and learning how best to live in the moment and control the anxiety around events out of my control are some of the things that I think would be very beneficial to me. The other thing I want to gain is an understanding of how these people thought and developed their philosophy. I find it very interesting how people decide to live their lives and these people were so far away from the normal, especially for their time. I hope to continue learning more and more throughout the years.\n', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, '', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', 0, 0, '', ''),

I was born in 1972 in Glasgow’s Southern General Hospital, Scotland and have lived in or near the city my whole life save for the three years I spent as an undergraduate student at the University of Dundee.  I graduated with an MA (Ord) in 1993.\n\nAlthough I took Philosophy in my first year at Dundee, I don’t recall the Stoics being mentioned at all!  However, I skipped rather a lot of classes so the deficiency may lie with me rather than the Philosophy Department!  In my later years at University, I focussed more on History and English Literature and left Philosophy behind.\n\nAfter graduation, I worked in various jobs - from ‘Marketing Executive’ to ‘Training and Development Advisor’ with a spell in a Call Centre in between.  My career - such as it was - ended when I was in my late twenties and suffered a nervous breakdown.  I am extremely grateful to my then employer for holding my job open for so long and then allowing me to retire on a full pension when I was just 31.\n\nThis might sound like a low point in my life but - although I didn’t know it at the time - it was actually a tremendously positive turning point as I had been ill and struggling for a long time while thinking this was ‘normal’.  It was also my introduction to Stoic thought as I received (among other help) Cognitive Behavioural Therapy as part of my treatment.  Gradually, I have learned to accept my diagnosis (Borderline Personality Disorder) and to manage it so that I am living in recovery rather than in the midst of emotional chaos.\n\n‘The Stoics’ have cropped up a few times in my reading over the past couple of years and, at around Easter this year I finally decided to find out a little more about them.  I had the idea that Stoicism was focussed on eliminating all emotional response to life and that Philosophy was concerned with asking your table if it exists and is, in fact, a table.  The first seemed unhealthy and the second pointless.  However, when I started investigating (beginning, as we all do nowadays, on Wikipedia) I found that my suppositions were incorrect.  I began to read more widely and soon found ‘Stoic Serenity’ by Keith Seddon which I worked through, thus being introduced to Seneca’s ‘Moral Letters’ as well as the ‘Meditations’ by Marcus Aurelius.  I am now working through Robinson’s ‘Stoicism & the Art of Happiness’ and have also dipped into such titles as van Natta’s ‘The Beginner’s Guide to Stoicism’ and Inwood’s ‘Stoicism:  A Very Short Introduction.’  I have deliberately not read Sellars’ works as I understand that ‘Stoicism’ is a set book for this course.\n\nI’m not currently a member of a religious faith and, if pushed, would have to identify as a ‘lapsed Catholic convert’!  I do believe that there’s a ‘Something’ - a Creator, Initiator, God - call it what you will.  It is infinite.  And I do not believe it is something that we, with our finite human minds, can adequately describe.  I tend towards the position that all human religions are attempts to describe and relate to this infinity and are therefore all equally valid as they all describe some aspect of the whole, indescribable Something.  It’s a lot easier for most of us to refer to this as ‘God’, follow a set of revealed teachings and live your life quietly in agreement with the majority of the people around you than to dwell too much on these things.  But, at the same time, I personally find it all fascinating.  I would love to have the religious certainty that some people (appear to) have but it eludes me.\n\nI am, however, a member of a Fellowship where I receive and give support.  Most people have heard of ‘Alcoholics Anonymous’ but not the related Fellowship ‘Overeaters Anonymous’.  Part of my Borderline Personality Disorder has involved my having Binge Eating Disorder and I found the help I needed in this Fellowship.  I mention it here because we are very much a spiritual (rather than a religious) Fellowship, working through our Steps from coming to believe that the God ‘of our understanding’ can help us to ‘having had a spiritual awakening’ and then ‘carrying this message’ to others.  I have been recovering with OA for the past three years and am now Sponsoring others in their recovery also.  Although I’m at the beginning of my journey with Stoicism, I find that I often share what I’ve learned in my reading and practice with my Sponsees and there is a strong connection between the ideas and ‘philosophy’ of the Twelve Step program and the Stoics. \n\nDo I consider myself to be a Stoic?  I know that Stoicism has helped me greatly.  I know that the practices I have adopted - such as a nightly review journalling exercise, daily readings (Holiday’s ‘The Daily Stoic’), trying to live simply, focusing on the here and now, remembering what is (and isn’t) ‘up to me’ - are immensely helpful and I attribute my recovery to them.  But I find that, while I appear to have learned to think in a somewhat Stoical manner I lack the theory that goes along with the practice.  I feel that I’ve only dipped my toe in the water and I would really like the opportunity to learn in a more structured manner and with the support of a mentor.  At the moment, I’m a wannabe Stoic who’s not educated herself sufficiently or become brave enough to say, ‘Yes, I’m a Stoic.’  I have a hazy idea of what that might look like - what a Stoic looks like - but if I try to wear the costume I feel like an imposter.  I hope that the course will help me to wear my Stoicism with pride - and also have the knowledge and confidence to share what I’ve learned with others.  At present I worry that I may misunderstand and so misrepresent the Stoic philosophy or even harm someone else in so doing.\n', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, '', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', 0, 0, '', ''),

I am a Father of a 6 year old and I work in Accounting in Houston, Texas. I have been interested in and aware of Stoicism for about three years now. I turned 31 yesterday (Aug 15). I think there has been a part of me that is naturally Stoic in some ways. For example, when I was 19 my Mother passed away unexpectedly. Being from a split household I suddenly had to handle a lot of adult responsibilities and I was a pretty immature person at the time. Not to mention I was about a week or so away from finals in college. At the time I was a Christian and this is when I began to have the most doubts about that faith. Instead I took up a very optimistic and positive attitude and told myself I would do everything possible that was within my control. I had a lot of strong realizations that I cannot control a lot of things in life, such as a family member passing. I successfully handled the Estate with the help of my Grandpa and ended up passing all of my classes with an A. I was only able to do this because of an intense focus I had on being sad for an appropriate amount of time and then keeping busy with the things I had a duty to do. Attending her funeral and also taking a final on the same day, to me at the time, was not a big deal, it was simply my duty as her son and a student. Looking back I attribute this to my first real encounter with a Stoic mindset and action.\n\nI first became interested in Stoicism when I read ‘Meditations’ and then ‘A Guide to the Good Life’ in 2017. I found out about this second book from Pete Adeny on his blog, Mr. Money Mustache. I had been a practicing Mustachian since 2015 and it is roughly based on Stoic philosophy (inadvertently). It was an easy transition into Stoicism. After reading ‘A Guide to the Good Life’, I felt like I had enough tools in my belt to go out and practice Stoicism daily, and I tried my best. After a while I found that I had internalized some of the practices but not all and I needed a refresher. That is how I ended up on Chris Fisher’s podcast, Stoicism on Fire, and how I ended up finding out about this school. The structure of the SES appeals to someone like me who does well with outside guidance. While I have read other philosophers such as Aristotle and Plato, I find I continually come back to Stoicism. I’ve read a few of the Early Church Fathers as well. While they are insightful, it only seems useful if you begin with the belief in God. \n\nAs I alluded to earlier, I grew up Christian. I lost my faith in that religion and God when I was about 22. I quit going to church and began identifying as an agnostic and an atheist, depending on the day of the week. I had an unhealthy anger for the Church itself, not necessarily the teachings. I essentially quit thinking of religion and spirituality until I was 25. From 22 to 25 were some of the worst years of my life and I think not having a set of guiding morals and principles in life definitely hindered me. At the end of the day it was my fault for making poor decisions, however. In 2015 just before discovering Mustachianism, I split up with my son’s Mother and began getting my life back in order. Last year in 2019 I began attending church services again with my son. I was Christian-curious. I felt like despite trying to embrace Stoicism that I was still missing something truly Spiritual in my life. Stoicism at the time for me was just a way to act better in the world, since I had only really read one book and it was Ethics-driven. As of this writing I do not consider myself Christian. \n\nWhen I found out about the Traditional Stoicism blog and podcast this really opened my eyes to the Spiritual side of Stoicism - or that there even could be a spiritual side at all. I do think that I believe in something like a God, Nature, or Collective Consciousness/Reason/Logos. This just makes the most sense to me and has for a while. I know that I do not and cannot accept a Jewish God or Jesus specifically, for that I am quite certain. However I find it very difficult to also accept that the Universe is random. It seems then that I am somewhat in the middle. I have always been intrigued by “native spiritualities” such as Native American traditions. What intrigued me the most was finding out that every culture had a “native spirituality”, even my own people. I began researching more about Germanic, Celtic, Roman, and Greek mythologies. For a short time there while I thought myself to be agnostic I also thought of myself to be some sort of “Pagan”. But neo-Pagans in America seem to focus too much on race or are too New-Age for me. Finding out that I can practice Stoicism and have a legitimate spiritual practice was eye opening and encouraging to me. I no longer attend church and I am working towards building that spiritual practice now.\n\nI would consider myself a Stoic, but not a very good one. I don’t know if that counts but I know that I would consider myself someone who strives for excellence and works hard. For over 10 years now I have believed in something I came up with called a “Continuous Improvement Mindset”. I came up with this in one of my first Accounting classes shortly after my Mom passed away. I had, for about a year, been striving to be better and better and finally was able to put a title on that simple life philosophy I had made for myself (it was an Accounting term from my textbook). \n\nFor the good periods in my life I was following this mindset of Continuous Improvement. It dictates that I cannot be satisfied with things and become stagnant and that I am to always strive to be better than I was yesterday, even if it is just a little bit. I also try to practice contentment and gratitude, daily. Another related concept/mindset I had come across was that of ARETE. I stumbled upon it when researching Greek Mythology and Philosophy. I was immediately drawn to it and began trying to apply what I thought it meant to my life. I had no idea at the time it was attributable to Stoics. I liked this “Excellence” mindset so much that I got a tattoo of the word. Ironically I got this during the “dark period” when I was 23. \n\nWhile I don’t believe happiness is the one true goal of life, I do believe and have experienced a true joy/blissful feeling that comes when things are going well in life. I think this is what the Stoics mean when they speak of Eudaimonia and being in a flow with Nature, but I am not entirely sure and I am still trying to figure this out. Either way, I experienced this as a by-product of consistent, good decisions being made in my life, and good use of my time every day. I accept these feelings of happiness and pure joy as a natural by-product and not necessarily my goal.\n\nMy aim with the College is to get a better foundation in the Stoic texts, meet more like-minded people, and get more insight into balancing Logic, Physics, and Ethics in my day to day life. I want to read these texts with more intention and gain a deeper understanding of Stoicism. At the end of the day I want to be a better person for myself, for my family, and for society. I want to pass this knowledge down to my children. I want to ensure that when I get to the end of my life that I look back and know it was a life well lived.\n\nThank you for considering me into the College. I look forward to meeting and speaking with y’all in the near future. \n', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, '', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', 0, 0, '', ''),

Only that it was fun.\nI imagine a large part of my rebellious nature came from this time.\n\nMy earliest memory of this time happened one evening.\nI was getting ready to go to youth club. \nI sat at the top of the stairs, waiting for my mum to finish with my older brother.\nHe was taking forever to get ready.\nHe refused to put his clothes on and was running around.\nI wasn’t sure what to do.\nI stood up and began to walk down the stairs to look after my younger brother.\nAs I walked down the stairs, I felt a push on my back.\nI fell forward.\nMy forehead cracked against the wall at the bottom of the stairs.\n\nI only remember the car trip to the hospital.\nI was holding a tea-towel on my end.\nI remember pulling it away from my head.\nIt was covered in blood.\n\n*Being a Child (6-9)*\nMy brother was later diagnosed and sent to a special school for autistic children.\nI was taken out of the old school and put into a school in the countryside.\n\nThere was only 5 other boys in my year.\nI was the new kid.\nThey had all grown up together.\n\nFortunately, they were welcoming and I fit in quickly.\nWithout my brother, my rebellious nature quickly subsided.\n\nMy school was not particularly religious.\nEvery morning we could read from the bookshelf.\nHowever, one day I found a book on the bookshelf.\nThe cover was soft, spongey and friendly.\nThe title read ‘The Bible.’\n\nI began to read it and was amazed.\nI asked my teachers, and they told me about God.\nI was amazed to discover it was all true.\nWhy would you read any other books when this one actually happened?\nJesus became my superhero.\n\nSoon after, I asked my mother if I could start going to church.\nShe said I could.\nI soon became the perfect Christian boy.\n\n*Being a Teenager (10-14)*\nMy Christian phase would soon end after I discovered the only thing more entertaining than God:\nVideo games.\n\nWhen I was 10, my year all moved up to another school.\nWhere I’m from, we have a lower, middle and upper school.\nIt was time for middle school.\n\nMy friends began to play video games in the evenings and on the weekends.\nI decided to prioritise friendship above my faith and opted to play video games instead.\n\nAround this time I suffered great pain from earaches.\nFrom the age of 10, I would suffer the most horrendous pains.\nThe only thing that could comfort me was sleeping on the floor next to my parents bed in agony.\nMy mother would take me to doctors where they would wash out my ears.\nThat too was horrendously uncomfortable.\nI would suffer from ear-aches for a few years, until I had my tonsils removed and they went away.\n\nOver the years, my mother tried to force me to go to church, which only made me despise it even more.\n\nAround the same time, I learn’t about the other religions.\nTo my mother’s horror, I ordered a translated copy of the Quran online.\nThis is around the time of the war - there were many stories of young people being radicalised.\nMy father managed to calm her nerves.\n\nIn my spare time, I learned of the other faiths. \nI thought I could figure out the truth that no-one else could.\n\nAt 14-15, I wasn’t a particularly good student.\nI would play games with my teachers.\nI would try to see how much trouble I could get into, and then talk my way out of.\n\nI recall once working a substitute up.\nHe got so angry he stormed me out of the class and up to the headteachers office.\nHe banged on the door.\nShe wasn’t in.\n‘Don’t you have to bring a lot of students to Mrs Doherty, Sir? Why don’t we just go back and I’ll promise to be good.’ I quipped.\nIt was true. This substitute teacher was rarely able to control the class.\nHe always had to call the headteacher.\nHe took me back and I didn’t get into any trouble.\n\n*Growing Up (15-18)*\nI finally moved onto upper school.\nMy video game phase would soon end after I discovered the only thing more entertaining than video games:\nGirls.\n\nI had a girlfriend soon after I came to upper school.\nI would later end things with her.\n\nHowever, it was around this time that I became aware of the social dynamic.\nInsecurities and overthinking began to assault my mind.\n\nMuch of this time was spent alone.\nIn middle school I had a strong group of groups that I had known from lower school.\nHowever, all of my old friends had gone to different upper schools.\n\nI knew no-one in this new school.\nI was too socially aware to make new friends like I did  when I moved lower schools.\nI spent much of this time bouncing between groups.\nI never found anyone that fit right.\n\nI would spend my morning alone hiding in the toilet.\nI would spend some lunches with the tough guys playing ‘Fight Club’ in the field.\nI would spend some lunches in the library, or talking to girls.\n\nI wasn’t unpopular, but I never really fit in anywhere.\nEveryone was my friend but no-one was close to me.\n\n*Sixth Form (16-18)*\nIt wasn’t until I moved onto Sixth Form that I formed a group.\nWe were great friends, and really got along.\n\nEvery week we would do something called ‘Wacky Wednesdays.’\nBasically, we would try to do something crazy each week.\nWe would buy 200 donuts and give them out to the school.\nWe would skip school and go to London for coffee.\nWe would hold a rave in one of the class rooms and charge for entry.\n\nI remember this time fondly.\n\nAround this time I would meet my first serious girlfriend.\nThe first day I met her, I missed my bus and walked her home.\nI kissed her on the corner of her street.\nIt took me 4 months to convince her to go out with me.\nApparently, I’m not a very good kisser.\n\nI studied hard during Sixth Form, and came out with good grades.\nEventually, I went to University.\n\n*University (16-21)*\nMy girlfriend continued our relationship.\nShe went to a university nearby.\nWe would see each-other every weekend.\n\nOnce again, I had lost my old friendship group.\n\nI was studying for a business degree and discovered that the teaching was useless.\nNone of the lecturers had started or ran a business.\n\nI wanted to study business because I believe it was the most effective way to have an impact on the world.\nAmazon, Apple and others have all changed the world in a major way.\nIf I wanted to have a major positive impact on the world, startups seemed the way to do it.\n\nI didn’t mind.\nI wasn’t at university for a degree.\nI was at university to learn and surround myself with interesting people.\nI resolved that I would start a business in my 3 years at university that would cover my tuition.\n\nIn first year, I started on my business and taught myself to code.\nI would spend every day and every night learning to code and start a business.\nI learn’t backend, frontend and app development.\n\nIn second year, I launched the app.\nIt was Netflix but for stuff.\nYou could pay a monthly subscription and borrow anything.\nSay you wanted a hedge-trimmer. \nYou could request it on the app and a driver would come and give it to you.\nWhen you were finished, you could simply return it and someone would pick it up.\n\nThe app did well amongst students.\nI was offered huge amounts in investment, but ultimately turned these down.\nI spent much of first and second year building and marketing this app.\n\n\nAt the start of third year, I met a guy named Andrew Kirby.\nHe was a YouTuber and told me about this thing called Stoicism.\nI listened to the Meditations on an audiobook.\n\nA few months later, I had the worst evening of my life.\nThis was the worst evening of my life for 3 reasons.\n\nFirstly, myself and my girlfriend of 4 years broke up.\nWe knew we would go in different directions after university ended.\nI wanted to go to America, she wanted to stay in the UK.\nWhy not end things now?\nSo we did. \nI then decided to have a nerf fight with some of my friends.\n\nHowever, before I got to my friends door I received a phone call.\nIt was my single customer. \nBasically, I made student halls pay for the student’s monthly subscription.\nThey told they were pulling 2 halls contracts, citing budget cuts.\nThey wished me all the best.\nMy business of 2 years collapsed in front of my eyes.\n\nFinally, I was shot in the eye with a nerf bullet.\nI immediately collapsed to the ground.\nI opened my eyes.\nI could no-longer see out of it.\nI was quickly rushed to hospital.\n\nI remember what Andrew had told me about Stoicism.\nIt really came in useful that night.\n\nThis night was around 9 months ago now.\nThings turned out in the end.\nI sold the company, got my degree and live a relatively free lifestyle.\nI read, think and write most days.\n\nI’ve studied many philosophies. \nEpicureanism, Buddhism and Taoism.\nI\'ve read a lot about philosophy from the ancient philosophers to the enlightenment.\nI would consider myself a Stoic.\n\nThe most pressing question on my mind is:\nHow should I spend my limited time?\n\nI have a deep understanding that life is limited.\nI know that Stoicism can help me understand how best to live that life.', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, '', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', 0, 0, '', ''),

I was not brought up in a particularly religious household, but at the age of 15 I became a born-again Christian after a particularly unique faith experience. This belief system guided me for several years, through college (B.A. in Sociology and Anthropology) and into my career in the Air Force (interestingly my call sign was "Socrates"). I was ordained and served as an assistant pastor whilst simultaneously on active duty.\n\nIt was around that time in my early twenties that I desired to learn the Bible in its original languages because I didn\'t want to take translators\' word for it anymore. I taught myself to read Biblical Hebrew, and some Koine Greek. It was during this exploration into the original Hebrew Bible that I saw how much was misunderstood by later Christian commenters and theologians. I decided that my relationship with the G-d of Israel was very real, yet not authentic as a Christian, and so I pursued conversion to Judaism. This was enough for my first wife to call it quits since she didn\'t want to raise children with a "non-believer".\n\nAfter some time my conversion was completed and eventually I ended up in a prestigious Torah learning institute in Jerusalem, Israel for two years as well as a rabbinic program (that I intentionally didn\'t complete). This was in my late twenties/early 30s. I also met my second wife at that time and place. We have three beautiful children together.\n\nThe education that I received at this Torah learning institute has really provided me with the additional discipline and confidence for learning new things that I carry with me until this day. As I wrote, I entered the school already able to read Biblical Hebrew, but every day, all day, we studied the Talmud and other texts that are in Aramaic/Hebrew and are in a minimized, or coded form. In other words, it was like daily deducing a puzzle dealing with argumentative logic in multiple languages. I had headaches for the first few months at the end of the day before I started being able to tread water in that environment.\n\nI hadn\'t decided on a career yet by this point. I left the Air Force in 2006 and had been doing odd jobs since. After a particularly eye-opening health issue resolution via herbal medicine that standard care couldn’t resolve, my interest was turned in that direction. \n\nWe moved to Maryland to be near the school, and in 2016 I graduated with a Masters in Acupuncture (M.Ac), and in December of 2018, a Doctorate in Oriental Medicine (O.MD). In this school I had to learn Chinese, Latin, Western pharmacology and anatomy/physiology and hundreds of acupuncture points, and hundreds of herbs and herbal formulas and what they do. As I wrote above, the school in Israel really prepared me for this.  \n\nI currently work full-time for two separate practices, treating everything from infertility, dermatology issues, mental health and of course pain.\n\nMy time at the school was transformative. I began learning philosophical Daoism, Neo-Confucianism, Zen Buddhism, Positive Psychology and many other similar things. It opened a whole new world for me. I began to question the theological and practical foundations of Judaism in the light of a way of living for me which felt more authentic and nourishing. \n\nUnfortunately, my second marriage didn\'t survive this change either and I am now divorced for a second time. I guess the lesson for me to learn is to not marry someone who would place religion above everything. My children live with their mom in another state.\n\nMy interest in Stoicism began at the beginning of the Covid lock down. I had just finished "Code Name: Chaos" the autobiography of General James Mattis in February of this year. In his book he mentions how often he turns to the Meditations of Marcus Aurelius for guidance and inspiration. I decided to give Meditations another look since I ignored the first encounter of the book in high school.\n\nIn the introduction to the Meditations copy I bought by Gregory Hays, his explanation of Stoicism was both succinct and left a strong impression. I read things about Stoicism that was at once familiar with my background in Daoism, and yet differently ordered and appealing to my Western mind. I had no idea Greek philosophy was so dynamic, interesting, and relevant. I decided at that moment to syncretize or incorporate Stoicism into my life.\n\nUp to now I have either read in entirety, or partially the following books on Stoicism:\n\nHow to be a Stoic by Massimo Pigliucci\nA Guide to the Good Life by William Irvine\nMeditations by Marcus Aurelius\nEnchiridion and Discourses by Epictetus (by way of Arrian)\nLetters on Ethics by Seneca\n\nI consider myself a pantheist, and I practice Native Germanic Spirituality, also known as Heathenism. I\'ve been a Heathen for almost 3 years. How I ended up here is another story. Basically it\'s not much different from Native Greek Spirituality (or Hellenistic Paganism) such as ancestor veneration and honoring the Holy Powers ("Gods") on different holidays/occasions. But Heathenism lacks a strong philosophy and ethical guideline, and I am really enjoying what I\'m learning about Stoicism for that.\n\nI\'m actually more open about my learning Stoicism to the general public than the Heathenism, and consider myself a practicing Stoic. I\'m particularly interested in traditional Stoicism since listening to Chris Fisher\'s Stoicism on Fire podcast. Although I’m no longer a monotheist, I still very much intuitively feel and require recognition of something bigger than myself that gives meaning to human action beyond just wisdom for surviving a harsh world.\n\nWhat I hope to get from this course is a solid foundation in traditional Stoicism so I can be better equipped to share its wisdom with others I encounter in life, as well as of course come closer to eudaimonia for myself. I also really like the concept of having a mentor to help guide my education, and provide some formality and instruction to my Stoicism learning. Although I have learned a lot on my own already, I think engaging in such a formal way will really give me the opportunity to have a solid foundation in Stoic thought.\n\nThank you for this opportunity.\n\nBlessings,\nDr. Brian Dougherty', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, '', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', 0, 0, '', ''),

My thirty-six years on this earth have been a largely positive experience. I was fortunate to have been born and raised in a home by two loving parents and a younger sister, who I am still close with to this day. I now live with my wife, who I married in February of this year, as well as our dog Murphy and our cat Arnold. We don’t have any children at this stage, but I imagine that we will be starting that next part of our life sooner than later.\n\nI have done quite a few different things in my life, but the most relevant would be my job as a police officer, which I have done for the last twelve years. My career has largely been focused on crime investigation and, most recently, I spent three years working in the Homicide Squad. I’ve seen the worst of outcomes in scenarios where people let their emotions rule their judgement and behaviour. I truly believe that a good philosophy of life instilled within the members of our community would go a long way to reducing some of this unnecessary death and destruction.\n\nSince leaving the Homicide Squad, I have taken up a new policing role which, whilst immensely rewarding, does not encroach on my personal time as much. This has allowed me to rekindle my love of reading. I have always had an interest in psychology and that has, quite recently, led me to reading some philosophy books.\n\nMy initial readings focused on Buddhist philosophy, which came about as a result of practicing mindfulness meditation. I initially took up this practice to help with difficulties sleeping, but quickly learned that this was only a very small portion of what this world of meditation and philosophy had to offer. Whilst I found the Buddhist texts to be enlightening, I had some resistance with its seemingly unnecessary over-complication of things. I also have a fairly sceptical attitude towards anything that moves beyond the field of ‘positive psychology’ and into that which is more spiritual in tone. I also found the translated texts to be somewhat esoteric.\n\nThrough both reading and podcasts related to Buddhist philosophy I quickly became aware of Stoicism. My first recollection of learning a Stoic philosophy was reading Epictetus’ Dichotomy of Control. To say that this reading was enlightening would be an understatement. Something about the plain, black and white, yet immensely well thought out suggestion clicked within me. This led me to read other books and subscribe to other podcasts related to this topic.\n\nI have been interested in Stoicism for the last twelve months or so. I have read a number of books, with the most recent ones being How To Think Like A Roman Emperor (Donald Robertson), Stoicism Today (Patrick Ussher and others), Stoicism And The Art Of Happiness (Donald Robertson), The Good Fortune Handbook (Matthew Van Natta), A Guide To The Good Life (William B. Irvine) as well as How To Be A Stoic (Massimo Pigliucci). With regards to the original texts, I have recently read Meditations (Marcus Aurelius) and I have just this past week begun Discourses/The Enchiridion (Epictetus).\n\nWith regards to my religious faith, I would consider myself an atheist. I had a fairly strong resistance to anything religious or spiritual growing up and I tend to believe that science, in the absence of a god, can go a long way to providing the answers that we seek. Whilst I would have previously said that I was opposed to religious faith, often believing that it was the cause and not the cure to many of the world’s problems, I am happy to say that my views have now softened. After finding some benefit in the Buddhists texts, I can now appreciate how a religion may serve as a useful philosophy to a person’s life. I do not, however, believe that I could ever convince myself hold faith in any particular religion, but I now see the immense benefit and comfort that it can provide to others.\n\nIn answer to the question on whether I consider myself a Stoic, I would have to say that I do not. As I sit here typing this essay, I tend to view myself as someone who has taken one or two of his first steps down the path of becoming a Stoic. I can appreciate the teachings and have yet to find any that I don’t fully agree with, however to me, a Stoic would be defined as someone who has more success that failures at implementing the teachings into their daily lives. I have certainly seen improvements, and the Dichotomy of Control alone has helped me immensely over this past twelve months. However, I would hesitate to call myself a Stoic just yet. I am easily distracted from the teachings and, more often than I would like to admit, I find myself still holding desire or aversion towards things that are out of my control.  I’m hopeful that with more reading and, perhaps most importantly, more practice, I will one day be able to view myself as a successful Stoic. However, at this stage, I do not believe that I am there just yet.\n\nI would like to enrol in the course as I believe that it will provide some structure to my reading. I currently highlight sections of the books as I read them and make the occasional note when I find something particularly interesting, but all of this seems quite pointless without having a structure of goal to work towards. I think a ‘back-to-basics’ course which would take me through the suggested readings and lessons in a particular order would be beneficial to increasing my understanding of Stoicism as a philosophy. I am also interested in any suggested exercises that may be offered as a part of this course. The element that is most interesting to me is learning about the actual implementation of this ancient philosophy as a practical way of living in our modern times. I think the idea of speaking to a mentor on occasion would be of immense benefit, as none of my friends or colleagues have any interest in anything of this nature.\n\nI should note that, whilst I work full time, my shifts are erratic and can change on a daily basis without much noticer. I mention this now in case this would cause any issues in moving forward with the course. I can always reply via email, but may have some issues locking in Skype conversation too far in advance. I also live in Australia, so there will be the time difference to consider.\n\nThank you for taking the time to read my introduction and I look forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nRegards,\n\nKane\n', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, '', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', 0, 0, '', ''),

Before responding to  the questions I have been instructed to answer in this essay, I feel a few premonitory remarks are in order. It is my suspicion that the coming paragraphs will appear, to some extent, devoid of many personal details about my life outside of my academic pursuits. This may, perhaps, give the impression that I have chosen to refrain from giving such details. Yet, that impression would be entirely erroneous, and to assent to it (so to speak), would be a mistake. In truth, the reason why my essay may seem devoid of non-scholarly talk, is simply that there is little in my life beyond my pursuit of truth, and of wisdom and virtue. I have a couple hobbies and entertainments in which I participate; for instance, I’m a competitive chess player. And yet, despite this admission, it should also be mentioned that I engage in such pursuits only when my mind is too exhausted from reading, and from thinking, to do either of these any longer. The absence of much else in my life other than the pursuit of truth and virtue, by way of scholarly study (for the former) and practice (for the latter), is hardly anything I regret, or wish were otherwise. Moreover, it becomes clear, when one realizes my age, that the nights I have spent sleepless in study have, in fact, returned a great profit! But enough of this digression! I have not been required to a write something the length of a treatise, and knowing my tendency toward an excess of ideation, if I continue to write, that’s exactly what this short essay will become! Now, seeing as there is little to mention about me beyond my love for learning and for bettering myself, I shall take what may be a somewhat odd approach to crafting this essay’s structure. I shall break it into sections (marked by the symbol, §), the first seven of which shall each, individually, reply to one of the seven questions I’ve been asked to answer herein. \n	\n§1. I shall begin by addressing the question, “How long have you been interested in Stoicism?” If I may be honest with my reader, the answer to this is difficult for me to recall. My first encounter with Stoicism occurred sometime between the ages of 13 and 15. For, I recall that, at the time, I had just begun attending high school as an 8th grader, which was a stressful (and hence memorable) period of my life. Anyway, my first encounter with Stoicism was by way of Epictetus’ rendition of it, as found in Arrian of Nicomedia’s Enchiridion and Discourses of Epictetus. Within the span of two or three years after that, I was deeply interested in Stoicism and began to invest much time to reading and re-reading the aforesaid works. For, at the time, there were many passages the meaning of which were unclear to me. However, after prolonged exposure to those two writings, my mind somehow attained a sufficiently complete understanding of their contents. In any case, to answer the earlier stated question in the most direct manner possible: I’ve been interested in Stoicism for around six years (maybe seven or eight).\n\n§2. As for whether I’ve read any books on (or, I suppose, in) Stoic philosophy, my answer is in the affirmative! The number of books I’ve read is rather lengthy, and so I’ve included my complete list (which is as exhaustive as my memory allows) at the end of this essay.\n\n§3. With respect to my views in the philosophy of religion, and especially as to the existence of God and the nature of such a being, I have so much to say that there’s no way to adequately summarize it all into only a couple paragraphs. I will try my best, despite this, to give some sense of where I stand on this topic. I neither affirm nor deny the existence of God, but rather, I stand in a state of suspended judgement. Most days though, I feel as though I lean toward the existence of God; but, even so, I lack sufficient evidence to warrant my suddenly believing in God with full-force. When I do feel more inclined toward belief in God, it is toward belief in a deistic or pantheistic/panentheistic notion of the divine. As concerns the latter (i.e. pantheism/panentheism), I much prefer the species of it that’s found in the philosophic systems of F.H. Bradley, Josiah Royce, etc., to that found in (say) the system of Baruch Spinoza. There are several reasons for this preference, but I’ll just say that, for one thing, the species of pantheism emphasizes the personal, or spiritual, qualities of God, whereas the latter species can, at times, seem to strip the divine of any semblance of personality. But, even if God does not exist, I could still be quite content with the universe, provided J.M.E. McTaggart’s vision be correct. In his system, I see an atheism with all the rigor desired by the scientifically-minded and others of a similar inclination, while also an atheism with nothing missing from the universe, so as to make the heart hardly notice the absence of any divinity.\n\n§4. In answer to the fourth question, which asked as to my religious affiliations, I say that I am Jewish, and hence perceive my religion as being that of Judaism. I’ve been Jewish for all of my life, and so have many in my family. However, and despite these facts, I wouldn’t call myself a “member of a religious faith.” My reasons for this are twofold. First, I do not, and have never, had faith in God; likewise, I’ve never had faith in the revelatory nature of the Tanakh, much less believed, as do a fair number of Rabbinic Jews, that the Oral Torah is authoritative and that its injunctions are (in any sense whatsoever) legally binding. Faith and reason seem to me to be incompatible with one another. And as a result of this, as well as that I care for nothing more so than I do reason, faith and I do not intermingle. Second, because Judaism is a religio-ethnicity, Jewish people (or, at least, myself and those I know) would find it odd to speak of themselves as being a “member” of the “Jewish faith.” To start, the term, ‘faith,’ in its religious sense, is chiefly Christian in origin and is rarely employed by Jews. But there’s also trouble with the peculiar word, ‘member.’ Since Jewishness is passed from generation to generation by way of matrilineal descent, it isn’t something a person usually chooses to become. Moreover, a number of geonim and rishonim (or age-old rabbis, if you prefer) believed that a person can’t choose to cease being a Jew. Allow me to expand on this a bit. Suppose a given Jew undergoes the conversion process and becomes a member of the Catholic Church. Moses ben Maimon (a.k.a. Maimonides) would, on that account, call the person a heretic. Yet, nevertheless, it would be the view of many rabbis that a heretical Jew is just that—a Jew who holds heretical views. In other words, a heretic Jew is still Jewish despite her being a bad Jew.\n\n§5. As my reply to the last question revealed: yes, I have studied philosophies other than Stoicism. If by ‘philosophies’ is understood philosophic movements, or schools, then I’ve studied (to varying extents) a great many schools that existed prior to the middle 20th century. With respect to the movements subsequent to the beginning of the 20th century, I’m modestly acquainted with most of the crucial ones, but especially those associated with the analytic tradition. Of all such movements, however, I’m most knowledgeable about 19th and 20th century Anglo-American idealism. In particular, I’ve invested a serious amount of time in study of the philosophic system of J.M.E. McTaggart. I’ve a certain fondness for his vision of the universe, which seems to me extraordinarily beautiful. Indeed, it was because of my deep interest in McTaggart, as well as that same fondness, that I first began corresponding with Prof. Ramesh K. Sharma—one of three people to have written a methodical and meticulous, book-length critique of McTaggart’s system. From him I have only come to possess an even greater appreciation for McTaggart. Additionally, I’ve always appreciated Prof. Sharma’s willingness to talk with me, despite that I was only 18 at the time, and had no official, educational credentials to back up my interest in his work. Aside from British idealism, I’ve also put a lot of energy into the study of the new realists and critical realists of the early 20th century, who rebelled against the idealism of the previous generation. Furthermore, I’m reasonably familiar with a large number of philosophers beside these. For instance, I’ve read several works by each of the following: Charles Hartshorne, D.M. Armstrong, Thomas Aquinas, Mary Whitton Calkins, Laurence BonJour, G.E. Moore, Aristotle, A.C. Ewing, Anselm of Canterbury, Nicholas Rescher, G.W. Leibniz, and J.F. Ferrier. The list goes on, of course, but I suspect what I’ve said already should be sufficient to answer the question.\n\n§6. Of all the questions requiring an answer from me, I rather think the sixth is the hardest. “Do you consider yourself to be a Stoic?” Well, I think my answer depends on what my reader believes to be essential to one’s being a Stoic. “Do you believe that nothing is your own save what is within the sphere of your volition?” Yes, certainly I do. “Do you believe that virtue alone is good, and vice alone, bad?” Yes, but only provided I may alter it a bit so it becomes: “Virtue alone is good for me, and vice alone is bad for me.” “Do you believe that virtue is both necessary and sufficient for one’s flourishing?” Yes, I do. “But do you, in addition to all of these, believe that there is one intelligent, active principle that pervades all things?” No, I don’t. “And what of the soul, or, if you prefer it, the mind or self? Do you believe it to be corporeal and corruptible?” I lean toward the incorruptibility of the soul, but I my belief is not firm, but is, instead, highly tentative. As for the corporeality of the soul or self, no, I don’t believe it to be corporeal. And so, you see, I agree with much of the core of Stoic philosophy, while also rejecting certain portions. Whether I am a Stoic, therefore, depends upon what the criterion is for determining who is a Stoic and who is not. On my part, however, though I will declare to anyone who asks that I endorse a great deal of Stoic thought, I leave the title of ‘Stoic’ to the sage. Let that person who is wise and virtuous—who has proven (solvitur ambulando) the veracity of Stoic ethics—call herself a ‘Stoic,’ and be called so by others too.\n\n§7. As for the final question, which asks what I would like to get from the SES course, I answer as follows. In applying for this course my principal aim is simply that I might learn new information about Stoic philosophy, and procure assistance from others in attaining to wisdom and virtue. Despite all of my study and practice, the path thereto remains shrouded in a veil of darkness, and the light of my intellect does not yet pierce far enough beneath that obscuring pall. This is not to say I’m clueless, of course! Rather, I only mean that I have a long distance yet to traverse, and that I may benefit from the counsel of others. Moreover, the journey to being a good person is one that can, at times, be lonely. And though one can complete it without companions, it is still easier when one has fellows who share the end in common. As Seneca writes: “One wise person will help another, not only with his own strength (that goes without saying), but also with the strength of the one he helps. Of course, the latter can fully develop his own capacities even when left to himself: the runner’s speed is his own. Yet even so, he is helped by being cheered on.”\n\n§8. Allow me, now, to return to the second question asked of me (see §2). As I said, I’ve read what I imagine is a fair number of books on (or in) Stoic philosophy. For the sake of avoiding confusion between which books are in Stoic philosophy and which are merely about it, I’ve compiled three separate lists. The first reckons the books I’ve read in Stoic philosophy; the second catalogues the books I’ve read about Stoicism; and, within the third, are those books pertaining to Stoicism that are more popular (so to speak).\n\nList I.

I possess a Bachelor’s Degree in philosophy.  This desire “to know” and “to be” actually began very early in life.  Even as a child, I enjoyed reading which always greatly stimulated my imagination and curiosity.  Why are there always…evil people, e.g., Captain Flint against Jim Hawkins (Treasure Island)?  Captain Hook against Peter Pan?  Why couldn’t the evil people work in concert with the good people (Jim, Peter) to accomplish common goals?  In the Bible, why did King Balak hire the prophet Balaam to curse Israel?  Why didn’t he hire him to bless Israel and create an ally and not an enemy?  Why is there moral evil?  \n\n     I was born in New York City in December 1952 (making me 67 y/o).  I am honored to have raised two sons and part of that time was while I was in the United States Army.  I am a retired soldier with 21 years of active duty.  This period of time allowed me to reside in many places around the world thus affording me and my family the golden opportunity to learn of different peoples, customs, etc.  This experience also gave my children a valuable lesson in dealing with the challenge of adapting to situations.  My military experience also “trained” me to become stoical while being totally ignorant that such a school of thought ever existed.  In the military, we used to say, “The more you sweat in training…the less you will bleed in war!”  Doesn’t that sound like “Premeditatio Malorum?”  At least as I understand it, which is the premeditating of problems, catastrophes etc., that we might be confronted (or challenged) with.  We are to continue to keep thinking on these issues until they no longer cause our hearts to palpitate quicker!  There were an incalculable number of instances where a stoical approach was the only option but admittedly, I wasn’t cognizant that we were incorporating these long-cherished principles! \n\n     How long have you been interested in Stoicism?  Early February 2020, my office rented the Conference Room of the local library for a meeting and while waiting for it to begin, I went to the section on philosophy.  “Unfortunately,” the selection of books was very limited but I saw Dr. Donald Robertson’s book:  “Stoicism and the Art of Happiness.”  (This meeting happened right before the COVID pandemic was also “brought to light.”)  I started to read the book and was so excited by the introduction that even before I entered the meeting, I had already taken my cell phone and ordered the book from Amazon.  So, my absolute fascination with this formal school of thought began then. \n\n     Books on stoic philosophy that I have read, am reading and will be reading that I have in my library:  Since February, I have ordered and accumulated nearly 30 books.  I already mentioned Dr. Donald Robertson’s book and I have read his “The Philosophy of Cognitive-Behavioural Therapy” and “How to think like a Roman Emperor.”  I am the very proud owner (and reader) of Marcus Aurelius’s Meditations (several versions); Epictetus’s Discourses and Enchiridion; Seneca’s letters (which I treasure as though he wrote them to me); Ryan Holiday’s The Daily Stoic (almost a daily stoic “devotional”).  I have Pierre Hadot’s “The Inner Citadel;” William B. Irvine’s “A Guide to the Good Life.”  (He seems to think that tranquility is the designed purpose of all stoic training…instead of virtue which would instill in a person tranquility as a by-product.)  “Musonius Rufus Complete Works” by Dr. Chuck Chakrapani as well as his series of books on stoicism.  (His books translate the Discourses in “plain English.”)  The Cambridge Companion to Stoics;  Becker’s “A New Stoicism;” Massimo Pigliucci’s “A Handbook for New Stoics” and also “How to Be a Stoic;” Brad Inwood’s “The Stoic Reader;”  Ward Farnsworth’s “The Practicing Stoic;”  Giles Lauren’s “The Stoic’s Bible.”  I also subscribed to the Daily Stoic website as well as to The ModernStoicism.com and TheStoicGym.com where I get to read articles.  I bought John Sellars, “Stoicism” when I became cognizant of this course.  I am very excited in using it as a “textbook” for the course.  My intent is to read it prior to the course beginning.  (When all is said and done…it isn’t the number of books that I read but the life that I lead because of the teachings of the books.)  I recently bought Tom Wolfe’s “A Man in Full” and I am looking forward to begin that one.  \n\n     I am a theist as I am a yarmulke (skull-cap) wearing Orthodox Jew and am deeply committed to the notion that my faith is intellectually defensible while being spiritually edifying!  I do not mean to assert that mine is the only religious expression that can claim that.  I even note many verses in the Christian’s New Testament that are stoical.  St. Paul was from Tarsus and that city was heavily influenced by Stoicism!  Moses Maimonides (1135-1204) was a rabbi, a philosopher and a physician.  He created a synthesis between Aristotelian philosophy and Judaism.  He expressed this synthesis in his philosophical magnum opus “Guide for the Perplexed.”  I hope to be able to do the same with Judaism and stoicism (and using the stoical principle of the “reserve clause”) with G-d’s help!  I am not saying that I will write a book but that I hope to be able to merge the basic presuppositions of both “philosophies” to create a new coherent and consistent form of thinking for myself.  \n\n     As mentioned earlier, I had to study different philosophies as part of my education.  I have studied Occidental and Oriental philosophy.  The Oriental philosophy that most appeals to me is Taoism as it also attempts to have the seeker come to terms with his/her role in nature.  \n\n     Do I consider myself a Stoic?  Dr. Chakrapani humbly confesses to being a “long-term, but embarrassingly inconsistent, practitioner of Stoicism.”  The only difference between him and me is that I am a “short-term…..”  I eagerly look forward to working with a trained mentor who can guide me to the next “place” in my journey.  As I am a relatively avid reader, I use the books as “mentors.”  But it “ain’t” the same!  \n\n     I am eagerly seeking a mentor (friend?) who will commit to me…as I intend to do likewise to him on this journey.  Seneca states in Letter 3, “On True and False Friendship,” “It is equally faulty to trust everyone and to trust no one…”  I am really a “trusting soul” looking forward to learning from a “like soul.”  I am looking forward to understanding more fully the implications of these teachings.  \n\n     Thank you for your patience in reading all of my “rantings.”\n', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, '', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', 0, 0, '', ''),

My name is David Sellers and for lack of a better way to introduce myself I shall go ahead and start with the basic facts about myself.  I am a 28-year-old process engineer at a nutraceutical company in North Salt Lake Utah.  My hobbies include drumming, video games, and cycling and I have been happily married for 4 years now.  My education is in chemical engineering where I completed my bachelor of science at the University of Utah in 2018.  Before that, I had spent about six years at the community college unsure about what direction to take my life before settling on chemical engineering.  I choose this major because I thought my struggles with procrastination had to do with my self-esteem.  I figured if I could do something really difficult then this would solve both my self-esteem and procrastination issues.  This, unfortunately, was not the case.\nI have been interested in and pursuing Stoicism since early 2018.  Relatively early in my community college career (2012/2013), I took a class in philosophy.  This was essentially a history class and briefly covered a multitude of different philosophies such as Stoicism, Epicureanism, up to Utilitarianism.  At this point I considered changing my major to philosophy but ultimately decided against it.  After taking the class, I knew that Stoicism appealed to me but I did not pursue it.  In early 2018 I started reading a financial blog and one of the books recommended was A Guide to The Good Life: The Ancient Art of Stoic Joy by William B. Irvine.  This was my official introduction to Stoicism as a way of life.  The idea that there are essentially daily practices, similar to religion, which allows someone to take philosophy out of the theoretical realm and implement these ideas in everyday life.  \nSince reading the book, I have purchased more books on Stoicism than I have actually read.  Of these books, I have not finished any.  To be honest, my main source of Stoic information are podcasts such as Stoicism on Fire by Chris Fisher.  That podcast is what lead me to the Stoic Academy.  \nIn terms of spirituality, I would put myself in the category of agnostic.  When I was about ten years old my mother started taking us to the meetings of Jehovah’s Witnesses.  I remember being so scared that the end of the world was imminent.  My parents separated when I was pretty young but agreed to joint custody.  For me, this meant that I was switching households every week and had two sets of everything including belief systems.  The influence of my dad is what kept me balanced while I was younger.  This religious stint early in my life, dealing with an apocalyptic religion, put me off to all forms of religion for a long time.  However, the belief that god exists never left me – I just don’t think organized religion is the best way to communicate or cultivate that in someone’s life.  Especially now that I know fear is a tool for control.   \nI am not a member of any religion.  I am put off by Christianity thanks to my history with the Witnesses.  If there was a religion that I would pursue it would most likely be Buddhism.  When I was in my early twenties, I was interested in the 8-fold path because I just felt like there was something missing in my life and I wanted to be enlightened.  From what I have read and seen on TV it seems like this is pretty common, young people early in life end up searching for something that will give their life purpose.  I was (and still) am trying to self-actualize.  \nI consider myself to be on the Stoic path, which from what I hear is all I can aim for.  There was a month-long period where I felt the Stoic joy of constricting myself to that which is within my control in the present moment.  It was wonderful.  It felt like I could finally breath; I could finally take steps in my life without being anxious about the outcome; I could focus on doing my best regardless of the situation.  I felt the shackles of procrastination break away.  It’s hard to describe but it was amazing.  What kicked me out of this was an incident at work which caused me to lapse back into my habitual way of thinking – disengaged, fearful, disorganized, etc.  My aim is to get back to this mode of living.  \nWhat do I want to get from this course?  I would like to strengthen my overall understanding of Stoicism primarily focusing on building a regimen of spiritual practices to build my fortitude for when life circumstances inevitably change and I am challenged.  I want to be able to apply what I have learned about Stoicism to my life in the moment.  I would also like to learn about the path and tools for growing my practice after this course is over.  These are my primary goals.  Whatever consequences of this practice, whether preferred or unpreferred, I will try and accept.                               \nI know that Stoicism will work for me because I have felt it work before.  There was a six-month period where my wife and I lived with my grandparents to save up enough money for a home of our own.  During this time, I listened to the Stoicism on Fire podcast, began reading The Inner Citadel by Pierre Hadot, and developed my own Stoic practice regimen which included negative visualization and mediation.  I was able to see past my mistakes, I was able to focus on what was in my control, and I was able to see through my desires and aversions and the unpreferred actions that they produce (PROCRASTINATION).  \nIn his podcast, Mr. Fisher talks about the assent, desire/aversion, impulse to action causal chain and how people try and break the chain at the last link.  I have suffered from sporadic migraines since I was about eighteen.  These migraines have a disconcerting ‘halo’ which signal that one is coming on.  The halo includes blurred vision, visual disturbances, isolated numbness which moves around usually starting in the face or arm, and inability to read or think clearly.  The migraine itself is quite painful as well and the halo is torturous waiting for the fun to start.  The worst part was I have no indication of when one will strike and this has been a source of anxiety for me.  \nDuring the six-month period I experienced a migraine while at work.  During the ‘halo’ I felt myself starting to panic as usual which only makes the experience more painful.  However, using Stoic techniques, I was able to regain control of myself and apply the discipline of assent.  Once I did this, I had a paradigm shift.  I experienced the migraine for what it was and not what I made it out to be.  It was still quite painful but I was not afraid of the pain.  I even ended up working the rest of the day as normal!  If this would have happened months earlier, I would have been a wreck.   \nThanks for reading and I am eager to develop my Stoic practice with this organization’s help!\n', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, '', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', 0, 0, '', '');

I joined the military and traveled first to boot camp in San Diego, then to North Carolina, Okinawa, then returned to San Diego where I lived for 10 years, serving at the recruit depot, Camp Pendleton, and Coronado Island.  \n\nThe major events that influenced my life were 1) having a very upstanding set of parents and grandparents who were devoutly ethical people who let me make my own mistakes (of course not without appropriate guidance that I more often than not disregarded), 2) growing up in a once prosperous small town in a slow progression of decline, being exposed to blatant and accepted forms of racism, 3) my military experience allowed me to be a voyeur of the caliber of youth admitted into our military as I worked for several years in recruit processing.  This experience started my interest in psychology in the first place, seeing such youth come to serve their country with this overwhelming sense of duty only overshadowed by their need to "fit in and belong" to something so great as our armed services.  These were youth who found no other community back home, the lost kids, the ones sometimes with no other hope.  And I was one of them.  I observed.  I learned.  I at first was amused, then curious of the mental processes of these lost souls.  I made it though boot camp family easily because I was s skinny and athletic kid.  My recruiter prepped me for the mental challenges of boot camp, "Keep in mind, they intend to break you, to make you feel so small and insignificant, like a rodent.  They will work you until you have no energy, they will provoke you, and try to make you fail.  And its all a joke.  Its all a game, so just play the game with a smile on the inside and a tough lip on the outside and you\'ll be fine".  And I was.  I enjoyed being inside the "game" and watching it play out on some of my cohorts who were less prepared and weaker minded.  Even when I coached them as I was coached, some of them were just incapable, which at the time I could not fathom, shouldn\'t they have been as capable as I, this scrawny dork from Texas?  \n\nI was nicknamed "Wild Bill Bell, Defier of Authority".  The less capables called me "The Fire of Authority" because they could not comprehend "Defier".  I was voted most likely to be kicked out because I made a habit of correcting my seniors.  In Okinawa I earned myself time scrubbing pots for a month because I told the Master Sergeant Chef that he was setting the silverware incorrectly on the table for a formal function.  He insisted he was right, and I chuckled that he was not correct.  But he did it his way, and was chastised by the Commanding Officer for getting it wrong.  So he punished me for knowing more than he.  It was such an embarrassment for him, a man of 18 years service, being corrected by one of six months.  I was sent to live with a group of outcasts who had been in trouble for various things, and we were called "The Infamous Seven".  While all the others were moved into the brand new "two to a room" barracks, the "7" were relegated to the old "hall-style" barracks.  But it was seven of us for an entire barracks.  We ended up having over 1000 square feet of space each.  It was a punishment of embarrassment but it was sort of a life of luxury at the time.    \n\nAlcohol use was rampant in the military.  We had beer machines in the barracks.  You could drink on base even if you were underage on the other side of the gate.  I wasn\'t a heavy drinker, but every event we had there was a colleague making a fool of himself.  \n\nDuring my time in San Diego, I completed my studies and became an elementary school teacher (as were many family members), then went back to school and studied psychology.  I spent the next 10 years slowly gaining my hours for licensure and eventually moving to the San Francisco area for work.  I found various jobs outside of my field that paid the bills for a few years, eventually landing a paid position to complete my internship and eventually become licensed.  \n\nAfter receiving my psychotherapy license, I continued working at the psychiatric facility for 21 years, supplementing that work with several contracts with the State Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation and Department of Mental Health, in addition to managing a part time private practice.  During my time at the psychiatric facility I was made aware of many regulatory and financial indiscretions that did not sit will with me.  I reported them to regulatory agencies and the facility was investigated.  Not once.  Not twice.  I became an untouchable for a while because it would have been retaliation against a whistleblower.  People asked me why I did it, risk my job for something no one would have been the wiser.  I did it because it was the right thing to do.  I did it because it was the ethical thing.  And it continued to happen and at a level and frequency that I could not longer ethically watch.  I eventually resigned in protest, and within a year the program was closed down for operating without a license.  Other than the ethical issues that honestly are a part of many facilities, we had good staff, some good doctors, people with real empathy, people who really cared.  And the psychopathic administrators tried to use that to keep me quiet, "Look at the great care we provide, why would you want to take that away from the community?"  During my tenure, I\'d been exposed to many less fortunate people from all walks of life, in all stages of productivity and decline, and in death.\n\nI also taught graduate level psychology for about 6 years.  I really enjoyed sharing real-life experiences with soon to be therapists.  \n\nI\'ve been interested in Stoicism for about 6 months.  I\'ve purchased several books; I completed Meditations first, followed by the Handbook, and I am currently reading The Inner Citadel by Pierre Hadot, and Discourses.  I am waiting on a few others I have ordered, including the Hymn and Seneca\'s works.  I have always been an Atheist since as early as I can remember.  My only other foray in Philosophy was as a course requirement for my degree, and I understood none of it at the time, later on I was curious about Schopenhauer and read a bit but at that age it was still over my head.  As a psychotherapist I become interested first in the works of Albert Ellis and Rational Emotive Therapy, and read extensively on Frederich Nietzsche.  I consider myself to have lived a Stoic life for the most part for years before becoming aware of it, perhaps not in the strictest sense but leaning in that direction.  \n\nSince learning of Stoicism, I have become intrigued with Greek and Roman history when in earlier years I was repelled by such an endeavor.  As I read new literature, I keep meticulous notes of my own with regard to the details from each source and compare across sources.  I also have watched Mossimo Pigliucci\'s Youtube videos.  \n\nI\'ve traveled to Greece three times; Rome and Ephesus once; toured over the course of my life much of what was the Roman Empire, and now when I return I will have much more interest in all the details I missed from these prior excursions.  \n\nI want to improve my knowledge of the Stoic lifestyle and integrate its teachings into my private practice, especially around mood and anger management.   I look forward to the course curriculum.', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, '', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', 0, 0, '', ''),

That happened few years before the fall of communism, but right in time to grow-up in a never ending transition phase. My parents belong to the first generation uprooted from the traditional village life and swept away by the industrial and urban development of the 70s. They moved to the big city as teenagers and had to take life in their hands at a very young age. Socialism was there to take care of their needs, until one day it wasn’t anymore. In the 90s, my mother and father were in their mid 30s, with two school-age children, and like many people of their age, trying to sustain a family during years of abnormal economic inflation. \n\nIt’s funny yet strange to see how the time and place of my childhood shaped me as a future adult. Not to say that I believe in determinism, but I think there are some traits we pick-up unconsciously from our environment. In the formative years of my childhood, people were enjoying freedom and were creating new identifies they could have never dreamt of before ’89. So for this and many other reasons, I grew-up with the mindset that if you put your mind to it, everything is possible. My parent’s biggest bet was on our (my sister’s and mine) education because they felt their chance was gone. In terms of formal studies, mine can be described as quintessentially humanistic. My high-school curriculum was focused on foreign languages, history and geography. My academic studies started in the sphere of law and continued afterwards in the area of human resource management. Through the years of work experience, I developed a keen interest in psychology, communication and the magic of human relationships. Outside school, I was involved in a theatre group when I was about fifteen-sixteen years old, and the later I joined a public speaking organisation. \n\nFortunately, the bug of curiosity has survived adulthood and keeps pushing me towards new intellectual territories. Three years ago I decided to challenge myself and learn something that I never thought I could: software development. For two years, I spent almost my entire free time learning and carving out a new profession as software developer. In the end, I decided that I like more working with software developers than being one myself and today I am leading a team of software developers. \n\nThe experience of going back to the more scientific area of work did leave a mark on my professional life. It made me see the outcome of my work in a more pragmatic way, looking at it as something which works or doesn\'t work, and seeing immediately if it adds value or not. It gave me a new perspective of work and the meaning if it.\n				\nThe freedom I had a child gave me also confidence to explore the unknown of the physical world and so, at the age of 23, I decided to live abroad for some time. I first moved to India for one year. After India followed Paris and after Paris followed Germany, living first in Bonn and now in Berlin. In total, it’s more than 12 years spent abroad, working and living in different cultures. One third of my life, which unfolded while picking up opportunities along the way.\n\nThe entire adventure of living abroad, and most importantly of moving countries, helped me to reflect on many aspects of life, from religion, to friendship, attachment and the meaning of home. I believe some of these are also key themes in the stoic philosophy and by reading and talking to other people I became interested in stoicism. I started reading Seneca’s Letters and Marcus Aurelius’ Meditations, but I haven’t finish them. Looking back, I believe these books require a different approach than the usual leisurely reading. \n\nDespite my interest in stoicism, I don’t consider myself a stoic. I don’t think I have a good understating of this term yet and I’ve never thought before of philosophy as a way of living. Ancient philosophy was thought to me more from the historical point of view and less from the practical side of life. \n\nWhen it comes to religion, I identify myself as Christian-Orthodox. As a matter of fact, more than 80% of Romanians identify themselves with this religion, which is either a cause or a consequence of the fact that tradition and religion are still closely inter-winded. When I arrived in India, my room was facing a small neighbourhood mosque and getting used to the call for prayer five times a day is one of the first things I remember from my experience. I went on to visit many Hindu, Sikh and Jainist Temples, as well as Stoupas and Buddhist monasteries. \n\nThis outward and inward exploration helped me to take some distance from my own beliefs, questioning them from time to time and eventually realising some major things for myself. First, that religion, wether I like it or not, shaped the way humanity evolved until today. Second, both as a belief and a practice, religion is a deeply personal thing and I believe it should stay as much as possible in the private sphere of life. And third, that spirituality is an important aspect of my life. \n\nSo what do I expect from this course and why am I subscribing? First and foremost, for the pleasure of learning. It’s one of my life goals (as I get older) to learn new things because I chose to and not because I have to. That also leads to less pressure and less expectations. If I get 1% wiser at the end of the course, then I will be satisfied. If not, I will take it as an experiment, but I know already that it will be an enriching experience. Another aspect which raised my curiosity about this course is the ability to read and reflect back with some guidance. And it’s this process that I am eager to go through.

In this way, I hope to clearly convey the information desired by the College.\n\n1.	How long you have been interested in Stoicism.\nMy interest in Stoicism began in 2010 just after ending my high school teaching career. I spent that summer riding my motorcycle around the Western US visiting National Parks, camping, hiking, and reading The Meditations in the evenings by the fire. I cannot fully convey the impact of reading the Meditations for the first time – his words and thoughts resonated like rolling thunder in my brain – it was revelatory, and I knew I couldn\'t go back. Over the last ten years I have pursued a circuitous and largely unstructured route through ancient and modern Stoic authors, as well as participating in Modern Stoicism Stoic Week activities and other events. But the journey has been guided largely by what I was aware of and what was available to me but lacked academic focus, direction, and rigor. Over the last few years I have felt stagnated in my progress and there\'s been a nagging feeling that since I feel Stoicism to be a part of my identity, I owe it to myself to take this seriously and study it rigorously. I need to be intellectually rigorous and honest with myself about it. It has only been within the last year or so that I learned of the College of Stoic Philosophers and the coursework and mentorship it offers to folks who are seeking more, as I am.\n \n2.	Any books you read on Stoic philosophy. If any, please list them.\na.	Marcus Aurelius - The Meditations\nb.	Epictetus (Arrian) - Enchiridion and Discourses (select, not all)\nc.	Seneca - Essays (On Anger-Book 3, On the Shortness of Life, On Providence, On the Tranquility of the Mind, On the Happy Life, On Providence) and Selected Letters to Lucilius\nd.	Musonius Rufus - Lectures and Sayings (King and Irvine translation)\ne.	William Irvine - A Guide to the Good Life\nf.	Donald Robertson - Stoicism and the Art of Happiness; How to Think Like a Roman Emperor\ng.	Massimo Pigliucci and Gregory Lopez - A Handbook for New Stoics\nh.	Pierre Hadot - The Inner Citadel (in progress as of Dec. 2020)\ni.	Other texts/media - The Golden Verses of Pythagoras; various essays/posts on the Modern Stoicism blog; essays by Chris Fisher, Erik Wiegardt and others on Traditional Stoicism and The College of Stoic Philosophers; various podcasts.\n \n \n3.	Would you call yourself an atheist, agnostic/skeptic, deist, theist?\nAlthough I am not well-versed in the detailed characteristics of all of these (or others, such as pantheism, autotheism, etc.), I would say that I most closely align with Deism. Ultimately, I think I am still searching to understand what makes the most rational sense and what seems to fit coherently with my lived experience.\n \n4.	Are you a member of a religious faith? If so, which and for how long?\nI am not currently a member/practitioner of any religious faith. I was raised for many years in the teaching of Christian Science but rejected this upbringing in my late teens/early 20s for its manifold negative impacts on my life. I have spent some time with other Christian entities such as the Unitarians, but ultimately never found a "home" in Christianity, despite admiring many of the core teachings of Jesus himself. I have also spent time learning about other faiths and philosophies, but my knowledge of Buddhism. Judaism, Hinduism, Zoroastrianism, and Islam is minimal. I have long admired the ethical teachings of Mohandas Gandhi, and other ethical thinkers/practitioners (ex., Albert Schweitzer), and I have developed a practice over the years of compiling the teachings of those I admire and attempting to live out what made the most sense, but there has not been an overriding organizing principle at play. \n \n5.	Have you studied philosophies other than Stoicism? If so, which?\nI have not made a formal study of philosophy and I cannot make any claim to being very knowledgeable about the various philosophical schools, leading thinkers, core philosophical principles, history of philosophy, and so on. My ignorance here far outweighs any knowledge. Through my educational background in Literature, and my personal readings, I have been exposed to many different schools of thought, but I cannot claim any rigor in terms of philosophical study itself. I have recently (fall 2020) begun listening to the History of Philosophy Without Any Gaps podcast by Peter Adamson, and it is providing me with a basic understanding of the history and development of philosophy and the key developments, theories, and people. \n \n6.	Do you consider yourself to be a Stoic?\nLabels are tricky and without clear definition we often run the risk of distorting what is meant by a specific term (ex., how we have abused the term “hero” in the media to mean anyone who does a good deed). If a "Stoic" is defined as one who is aware of core Stoic teachings, and attempts to improve his/her life through regular practice of the Stoic Disciplines of Desire, Action, and Assent, then yes I would consider myself a Stoic. I haven\'t seen anything codified about what constitutes or defines a Stoic (i.e., any correlative to the Nicene Creed) and so the definition of a Stoic and the "qualifications" to consider oneself a Stoic are a bit vague to me. For everyday purposes, however, I consider myself a Stoic, but I don’t go around proclaiming it to the world.\n \n7.	What you want to get from this course.\nOverall, I want to develop greater competence and mastery of Stoicism, both academically and in practice. I feel like I have been apprenticed to Stoicism for some time, but I have much to learn before I can become a competent journeyman, much less a master. To help me on this path requires engaging with a mentor who can help aid my development and progression. Fundamentally, this is what I am looking for from this course and the College of Stoic Philosophers.\n\nBeyond the general, I have several specific goals that I would like to achieve or approach as part of this engagement with Traditional Stoicism. \na.	Develop a more coherent approach or course of study of Stoicism with specific goals and outcomes - to be more methodical in terms of understanding "what there is to know" about Stoicism. In effect, to create my own coherent roadmap for growth that I can manage over time. \nb.	Gain a deeper and more rigorous understanding of the philosophy of Stoicism (logic and physics, in addition to ethics), and the philosophical and rational foundations of Stoicism. I need to understand the root causes and justifications for things - not just take them on faith because someone had a nice quote in a book. I need to do the intellectual work for myself. \nc.	Gain an understanding of the "religious" nature of Stoicism, or perhaps more precisely the Stoic conception of God/Deity. What I have learned from the Stoicism on Fire podcast has stirred my curiosity about this and it resonates with me. I need to learn more. \n\n', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, '', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', 0, 0, '', ''),

I’ve been working as a software developer for the past several months (an entirely new career for me) following my completion of an accelerated coding bootcamp. I am happy to say I truly enjoy this work—it challenges me to creatively solve problems through logical processes. But it’s not exactly what I set out to do. Before attending software school, I had a one year tenure as an 8th grade English teacher (during which I realized I had massively overestimated my capacity for such noble and difficult work). And before that, I worked in retail sales, while teaching philosophy on the side as an adjunct professor at Belmont University. This was my passion, and what I hoped to do with my life before realizing a growing family (three kids now!) and an impenetrable job market made the pursuit of a real career in academia unsustainable.\n	One of the questions that has always been central in my classes, and in my own research, has been the question, What does it mean to live a good and meaningful life? The way I see it, this is not the kind of abstruse theoretical question that academic philosophy is often known for, but it is actually a deeply practical question that we almost can’t help but engage with. It’s probably a question that everyone asks themselves at some point, on some level. And often, when it occurs us to ask about the meaning of our lives, it doesn’t present itself to us as a question so much as a crisis. It hits us like a blow to the head when tragedy strikes, when we are faced with our greatest struggles, when the future is suddenly and terrifyingly uncertain. To paraphrase Schopenhauer, when human beings experience pain, unlike other animals, we suffer doubly: once from the pain itself, and then again from the nagging feeling that it has to mean something, that we have to fit our pain into our lives in a way that make sense somehow. Otherwise, what’s the point? \n	The greatest personal challenge I have faced occurred while I was an undergraduate student at Belmont University, when some health complications led to the discovery of a cyst in my brain. It was benign, it had probably been there my entire life, and had never caused any problems. (The circumstances that led to its discovery turned out to be incidental and unrelated.) However, since it was determined that the cyst had been growing for some years, doctors recommended it be removed through surgery, just in case. So, in January 2009 I was admitted to the hospital—for the first time since I was born—for brain surgery. And what was meant to be an operation to prevent future health problems became the cause of a year and half of daily suffering. Complications from the surgery began about three months later after I had returned to school. I began experiencing debilitating headaches, pressure, blurred vision, and intense aching and tingling in my neck and shoulders. Somehow the way the brain had healed after the surgery had led to hydrocephalus—a dangerous build-up of fluid in the brain. A day or two after this discovery I was admitted for an emergency surgery in which a shunt was connected to my spinal cord to help drain the fluid. Unfortunately, once again, the corrective action turned out to be worse than the initial problem. Almost immediately I began having daily “low-pressure” headaches, which would require me to lie down every few hours to regulate the flow of CSF. Doctors assured me that my body simply needed time to adjust, so this went on for over a year before finally a neurosurgeon determined the shunt was not working properly. So, I had a third surgery to shut off the shunt in the hopes that everything would go back to normal. In some ways this was the most difficult time. I had up to that point mostly remained trusting and hopeful, but while recovering from that third surgery I hit a breaking point. I felt a great deal of frustration and (certainly unjustified) resentment towards my doctors and their inability to correct a problem that, it seemed to me, they had caused, since I wasn’t having any symptoms in the first place. I was painfully aware of the irony of my situation as it appeared to me: that I had been perfectly healthy until my doctors had got a hold of me. And this new, apparent solution, to clamp the shunt and simply render my previous surgery ineffective, seemed only to emphasize the pointlessness of the pain I had been through. On top of that, no one knew for sure if it would work. I remember a few days after that surgery, recovering in the ICU, lying awake in the middle of the night, having barely gotten any sleep in days, unable even to relax because of the anger I was feeling toward my situation. I remember clenching my fists, thinking all of these thoughts, on the verge of tears, waiting for my next dose of painkiller. And I remember asking myself, What’s the point? At first this question came to my mind simply as an outburst of my frustration. But then I began to reflect on it, and I began to see it in a new light. What is the point of this pain? What can I make of it? I had recently taken a class on ancient philosophy and the Stoics quickly came to mind. So I grabbed my phone and found on the internet a copy of the Meditations of Marcus Aurelius. And soon enough I came across this bit of wisdom: he writes, “Remember this principle: When something threatens to cause you pain, the thing itself is no misfortune at all. For to endure it and prevail is a great good fortune” (4.49). And I realized that everything in life, the good and bad, all that confronts us or presents itself to us is an opportunity. Life itself is an opportunity to actualize our potential, to make something out of our struggles, to create meaning and value wherever it seems to be lacking, and to help to create such opportunities for others. Because human potential is virtually infinite. As Marcus Aurelius wrote, “Our inner power…reacts to events by accommodating itself to what it faces…It turns obstacles into fuel, as a fire consumes what it thrown on it—and burns brighter” (4.1). All we require is fuel, that is, opportunities to embrace our potential, a will to recognize our responsibility in attaining a good and meaningful life, and a willingness to help others to do the same. \n	I did finally fall asleep that night in the hospital. And a couple of days later, my body finally did begin to regulate. The third surgery had worked. Ever since, I have been relatively pain free. But I’ve also realized that my pains and struggles are not my enemies. They are opportunities. And opportunity is all any of us really needs to learn how to create a good and meaningful life. \n	Since then, and especially in the past few years, because of the routines and pressures of both everyday life and bigger life changes, I feel like I have been drifting away from the me that had this realization. Even though I still believe it to be true, I don’t feel that I am true to  my practice of it, and it has led to life choices that have damaged myself and my family, though not irreparably. Hence, my desire to take this course and re-immerse myself in the wisdom of the ancients.\n	I have been interested in Stoicism for about 12 years, since I started learning about them and reading their works as a philosophy undergraduate. I have read and/or taught MA’s Meditations, the Enchiridion of Epictetus (along with many of the Discourses), and Seneca’s On the Shortness of Life, in addition to secondary works such as Hadot’s Philosophy as a Way of Life and What is Ancient Philosophy?.\n	Although I grew up as a Christian in the Protestant tradition and took it very seriously up through my early twenties, I would now describe myself as an agnostic. Through reading Kierkegaard and other important life experiences, I have come to be something of a cynic with regard to the “institution” of Christianity (if that’s a thing), or the machinations of  Christendom as an immanent cultural phenomenon of human civilization. This is not to say I don’t believe in God, or that the existed of God cannot be known; it certainly does not mean we should consider it a waste of time trying to figure it out. I did not lose faith in God so much as I lost faith in myself as a person who ever had an authentic faith, and in the institutions that insist on what I now believe are bogus and self-serving interpretations of what it means to be a person of faith. All that is to say, I know what I don’t believe, but mostly I’m still trying to figure it all out. \n	As a student and former teacher of philosophy, I have read some of or at least learned about most of what’s considered to be the Western canon, as well as a fair amount of Eastern philosophy. My research interests in graduate school were Ancient (mostly Plato, but also Aristotle and the Pre-Socratics) and Nietzsche, in addition to Philosophy of Religion and Ethics.\n	I certainly do not consider myself to be a stoic. (Even if I was a currently attempting to practice, I believe that would be presumptuous). But I am deeply interested in the practical value of Stoicism the life-guiding principles it provides (as well as, of course, the theoretical side of it). What I hope to get out of this course is an deep engagement with this ancient tradition, an opportunity to make a plan of action for bettering myself as a person, husband, father, friend, etc., and a community who can help hold me accountable to my aspirations to live a good life, in the classic sense.

I grew up in Merritt, BC, Canada, I lived in Vancouver right after high school, I went to a tech-school for a 10-month Audio Engineering course and never found a job with that afterwards. It did work out in that Vancouver is where I met my wife. We moved to Slave Lake, AB shortly after getting married and have been there since. After moving to Alberta, I started a career as a carpenter, woodworking and building were always things I enjoyed. Three years ago, I got the opportunity to try my hand at teaching carpentry and that is what I am currently doing. I find teaching to be very job rewarding and get to spend much more time with my family, which was sometimes a conflict in working Construction. Additionally, I am currently taking university courses part-time to get a diploma in adult education and may later extend that to a bachelor’s degree in education afterwards. \nIn my spare time I enjoy working on renovations in our home, yardwork, jogging and reading. I also enjoy and cherish the time I get to spend with my family. We recently got a camper and look forward to camping each summer now, it’s a good way for us to spend time together as a family without as many modern-day distractions and activities. We also started a vegetable garden this past spring and enjoy that as a family activity.\nI have been interested and learning Stoicism for about 2 and a half years, since August 2018. My mid to late 20’s we difficult, I had what Epictetus would have described as a troubled mind and was kind of lost in life. At some point I discovered Jordan Peterson’s work and found that to be immensely helpful, but not quite as fulfilling in some way that I figured it should be. When I discovered Stoicism, I thought it would be more fulfilling perhaps it was what I was looking for. How to Be a Stoic by Massimo Pigliucci was the first book on Stoicism I read, and I picked up Epictetus and Meditations shortly afterwards. Epictetus quickly became my favourite of the Roman Stoics, I really appreciate his blunt and direct style, I get the sense that he wouldn’t have been someone you could easily fool, even if you can easily fool yourself.\nSeveral months after discovering Stoicism, reading Epictetus, Marcus, Seneca, and a few modern authors I began to feel like I was missing something, I was contemplating giving it up. I re-read Epictetus especially but didn’t feel I was making any progress just re-reading and reading modern interpretations through books and blogs. I stumbled upon Stoicism on Fire and that rekindled my desire to stick with Stoicism and continue to learn and put it into practice. I am confident now that it has become my philosophy of life and intend to continue along the path. I have found it to be a way to realize and find meaning in life, and that was lacking in my life for quite some time. In that I do consider myself a Stoic, or a prokopton, I have adopted into my life and intend to continue learning so I can better implement it to guide my life. That is the main purpose of my pursuing the Stoic Essential Studies course, increase my knowledge, gain a better and deeper understanding of Stoicism; to help ensure and get me pointed in the correct direction so I can continue my journey in a productive and meaningful way. \nWhether or not I am a theist is a difficult question right now, though I would say that’s probably the most accurate description. I was an atheist for close to 30 years, never grew up in a religious home, never really thought about God at all. A few years ago, I switched to a more skeptical or agnostic position, and since I have started studying Stoic Physics that has moved to be more theistic. I have come to realize the importance of the physics to the rest of the philosophy and feel that everyone should study it, along with the logic, if they want to truly understand the ethics and Stoicism as it is.\nI have also been interested generally in philosophy for the past 3 years, I haven’t yet read much, a few compendium books, as well as some Plato and Aristotle, Descartes, John Stuart Mill, Harry Frankfurt, and Agnes Callard. Most of what I have learned about other philosophies has come from podcasts, particularly the History of Philosophy Without any Gaps, or from Great Courses lectures on Philosophy.  I tend to have lots of time to listen to podcasts either when doing yard work or doing renovations. I have found learning and studying philosophy to be rewarding, I enjoy having difficult things to think and ponder about. \nI have read several books on Stoicism since then and tend to always be reading something relevant to it in some way.

I am a semi-retired professional engineer who lives in Wickenburg, AZ. 61 years old, happily married for 35 years with two grown sons, I was Managing Partner of a consulting engineering company for 20 years. I sold the company when I was 55. After a year off, I took a role as a consultant for a large manufacturing company doing special projects for the president as well as customer training and mentoring of young engineers. In addition to my consulting work I taught Engineering at the University level for 15 years. I also served on a number of boards and committees in the communities I lived in, including being volunteer Firefighter for 10 years and I currently serve on the Yavapai County Search and Rescue team. My passion (other than philosophy) is riding, traveling and working on motorcycles, something I have been doing since I was 6 years old. I have traveled extensively throughout the world by motorcycle. It is a fascinating way to see a country and interact with the people along the way. \nI became interested in Philosophy when I was 16 years old and read Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance. I mistakenly thought it was a book on motorcycle maintenance. Of course, as a 16 year old, I did not understand most of the philosophy in it, but it made me want to learn more, so I bought books by Plato, Hume and Kant because they were referenced in the book. Talk about diving into the deep end. They were over my head, but it kept me thinking and when I went to engineering school I took as many philosophy classes as I could. I wanted to know how I could achieve excellence professionally and personally. I did study some stoicism but I don’t think it was taught well and did not make much of an impact at the time or so I thought. I have reread Zen several times over the years as well as his second book Lila. One item that caught my attention in Zen, as I started to learn about Stoicism, is that he praised the sophist for teaching Arete. However, it really seems he is covering a lot Stoic thinking but misattributed it to the Sophists. \nThe other significant influence on my life was my father. He was not Stoic in the formal sense, but I would say he lived his life as a Stoic Philosopher. He was self-taught and owned several businesses over the years. There were failures in the beginning but ultimately, he was very successful. When I was 10, he was diagnosed with lymphoma and passed away when I was 19. Knowing his time was limited, he sold his business and spent as much time as he could with my brother and I. Fortunately, the cancer was not too debilitating until the last 6 months, so I am blessed with many memories of the time we spent together. One of my favorite memories is he would have me read to him since his cataracts made reading difficult for him. Forbes Magazine always had a section called “Thoughts on the Business of Life” which would be a page of quotes from famous individuals in history, FDR, Franklin, Tolstoy, Seneca, etc. I would read to him and then we would discuss the quotes. Not a formal education, but it introduced me to ideas I would not have be exposed to normally at that age. Other lessons I learned from him was charity towards others less fortunate (he was involved in many philanthropic organizations and freely gave time and money to help others). But he also helped employees and friends quietly as I later found out.  Treating others equally was another important lesson. I recall at his funeral, there were many wealthy individuals and politicians with whom he delt with, but there were also hourly employees that worked for him. Even though he sold the company 5 years before he passed away, many of his former employee’s came and made a point to tell me how he helped them when they needed it or just how he treated them with fairly and with respect. The UAW had tried to organize his company several times and failed. At the funeral I learned that they were voted down because the employees knew my father was already treating them fairly and they had nothing to gain. I was told the current owners were not of the same mind and the employees had recently voted the union in. That made a big impact on me and when I started running a business I always tried to act as I thought my father would. \nThat is my background in a nutshell. The following are more specific answers to some the questions:\n1.	How long you have been interested in Stoicism. \nI started to investigate Stoicism when I turned 50. My boys were out of the house and I had more time to start reading. I have always enjoyed reading and learning but with a family and business, I had less time to devote to this pursuit.  Somewhere I read Bill Irving’s book and that lead to learning about Donald Robertson, Ryan Holiday, etc. Eventually, I stumbled across Chris Fischer’s podcast and learned about this organization. \n2.	Any books you read on Stoic philosophy. If any, please list them. \nBill Irving’s books, as I already mentioned. Ryan Holiday’s books, Massimo Pigliucci’s books, Ward Farnsworth’s Book, Larry Becker’s Book (did not resonate and did not finish – need to go back and reread). Those were what I started with. I have also read several translations of Meditations, Seneca’s letters, Discourses, the Enchiridion as well as Musonius Rufus. For the actual texts, most of not been read straight through from start to finish. Rather, I read and use a passage a journal entry each day. I started this when Daily Stoic came out but rather than repeat the passages in there each year I started researching my own. Currently reading Pierre Hadot.\n3.	Would you call yourself an atheist, agnostic/skeptic, deist, theist?\nI am not sure what the right term is. I do believe there is a god, or force or intelligence, but not in the Judeo-Christian sense. I developed this belief long before I became interested in Stoicism.  Even as a child the Judeo-Christian God, as portrayed in popular literature did not make sense to me. However, it has always seemed that there is enough order that there is some kind of organizing force out there. \n4.	Are you a member of a religious faith? If so, which and for how long? \nRaised Lutheran but not really practicing since I was about 13. My wife is Catholic and I do go to Mass with her sometimes. It can be very peaceful and a good sermon can be thought provoking even if I don’t believe much of the underlying theology. At the same time, I am not antagonistic towards those that are religious. It seems that some of the modern stoics are reformed atheists and view any religion as something to be disdained.  \n5.	Have you studied philosophies other than Stoicism? If so, which?\nI can’t say I have “studied” other philosophies. I have read other philosophical work and was exposed to other schools in college. But I would not characterize it as a deep analysis or commitment to any particular school.  Here and there I would pick up books on various philosophies but definitely no concentrated study of any particular school. The last few years I have listened to a lot of Podcasts and read articles on various philosophies. \n6.	Do you consider yourself to be a Stoic? \nI believe I have many stoic tendencies, some of them were around before I even learned of stoicism. At the same time, I feel I am still learning and have not fully integrated all the stoic thoughts and exercises into my daily life. \n7.	What you want to get from this course. \nI have learned a lot over the last couple of years. The more I am exposed the more I learn how little I really know. There is only so much you can learn on your own and I do not have anyone whom I can discuss Stoic Texts or that can correct me if I make a wrong assumption. I do not really view social media as an option. In my explorations, this path of study seems like the only option if I want to continue to progress as a Stoic. Also, many of the current books focus only on the ethics. Having listened to Chris Fischer’s podcast and reading the texts I want to delve more into the logic and physics of stoicism.  \n', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, '', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', 0, 0, '', '');

First, allow me to say that for quite a long time (roughly 4 years now) I have deliberated over joining the College of Stoic Philosophers. Only until now, some time after completing my degree in philosophy, am I now applying to learn more about Stoicism through this program. I have tried self-study through a variety of authors, both contemporary (such as Donald Robertson, William Irvine, Massimo Pigliucci and Ryan Holiday) and classical (such as Musonius Rufus, Epictetus, Seneca the Younger, and Marcus Aurelius) texts, but I realize that I need someone to help me truly understand what these men wrote. I seek entrance into this program solely to answer the one question I have sought an answer to for most of my life- “What is a good life, and how do I live it well?” I believe that mentorship and fellowship will help me in my search for the answer to this question. Therefore, I ask to be enrolled in the School of Essential Studies. This will hopefully lead to further cultivation of my love of Stoicism and of philosophy in general.\nI, in no way, consider myself a practicing Stoic but have found myself drawn to their teachings. One day, I hope that I can hold myself to such an ideal to live in a way that the Stoics would say emulates the sage. I have incorporated many of their teachings into my life and I hope that I can continue to do so.\nIn order to attempt to know myself as I currently am, I rather need to look back to who I was and allow you to understand who I am. From my younger years until I was a teenager, I lived with my mother. There were few rules and no accountability, so I was able to do as I pleased… when I pleased. This naturally led to a rebellious child that needed a sense of structure and rules. This ultimately led me to ask my father to live with him out of some deeper desire to have rigidity and discipline. This worked out to my advantage. I went from a failing middle school student to a flourishing high school graduate, near the top of my class. Additionally, it was my father who introduced me to philosophy at a young age. He provided me a copy of Ideas of the Great Philosophers by William Sahakian. While the material is a bit watered down, it did foster a desire to learn more. While in high school I read the works of Plato, Descartes, and Locke.  This led to my eventual decision to study philosophy in college.\nOnce I began attending college, I realized I was exactly where I was roughly six years ago. I had no parental oversight and guidance, and my decisions were now my own. I did what many young adults did, and I enjoyed the hedonistic pursuits of life. I initially studied history and English, but I yearned for philosophy once again. I made an honest attempt at it, but I soon found myself without a sense of direction in a field that required self-discipline. Schools of study that included metaphysics, philosophy of religion, ethics, and political philosophy did little to interest me. I was seeking the wrong sources to my question. Ancient Greek philosophy was close to answering my question, but it was more of a survey than seeking the arete, as my professor referred to it. The academic study of philosophy was strictly that- academic. There was no pragmatism involved in my studies, so I quickly found myself more interested in the temporary indulgences in front of me. I dropped out of college in my senior year (2013) and proceeded to loaf. Seeing I was in a state of decay, my father once again pushed me into a direction of rigidity and discipline- the Army. \nI went through the usual experience of boot camp and training, feel free to watch In the Army Now starring Pauly Shore and Andy Dick if you are keen on learning what it is like. However, it was not until I went to Kuwait (and by extension Iraq and much of the Middle East) that I was truly introduced to Stoicism. My father gave me a copy of Epictetus’ Enchiridion and told me to read it a few times to find some form of comfort in it during those times. I did as he said and read the book a few times through my rotation in the Middle East. It was not until later that I encountered the other Stoics. \nMany of the other philosophers in the Stoic school were interesting (notably Musonius Rufus), but none spoke to me the way Marcus Aurelius’ Meditations did. To date, it is the only book that has come close to answering my question. It also inspired me to once again look at my situation and realize that I needed to return to the classroom and finish my undergraduate degree. I left the Army in 2018.\nI returned to my studies where I left off at the University of Florida. This time with a militaristic discipline that led me to graduate with (I’ll take the liberty to call this late-term) GPA of a 3.15. Notable courses I took during this attempt at the degree were: Philosophy of Religion (of which I am still reconciling intelligent design and the problem of evil as a skeptical theist), Existentialism, Rules and Reasoning, and my seminar was on Hannah Arendt. However, even with that militaristic discipline none of those courses provided me the clear direction toward answering my question. Thus, I turn once again to Stoicism.\nI am now employed with the State of Florida as an administrative assistant, using the tools that philosophy has provided me to assist the people in any capacity that I can. However, something still lingers. Once again, I am confronted with that sense of absolute freedom that has led me down the wrong path twice before. I believe that a more rigorous study and practicing of Stoicism will prevent me from making the same mistakes I made in my younger years. That is where I am now. I am confident that with a bit more study in Stoicism, I will be able to answer my question. \n', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, '', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', 0, 0, '', ''),

I was born in Philadelphia in 1982.  Growing up, I lived around in the Northeastern United States.  Largely, I had a suburban upbringing, though always with easy access to forests for exploring.  Beginning martial arts at a young age contributed to an early and enduring fascination with Asian culture and personal development.  As a high school student, I fancied myself a heterodox thinker.  I have always been attracted to wrestling with ideas—particularly those widely and unreflectively accepted ones belonging to the prevailing culture.  I broadcasted my skepticism, debating anyone on any topic, and purposely dressing as cheaply and out-of-style as I could manage. Presumptuous as it sounds, I wanted to act as a walking reminder that the status quo value system was absurd.  It is fitting, then, that the first serious work of philosophy I read was Thus Spoke Zarathustra, which accompanied me through my high school graduation and into my freshman year at Vassar. \nIn college, I found my way into the philosophy department through a challenging Introduction to Western Philosophy course.  I only ended up studying the classics to the extent that the requirements of my major demanded—mainly The Republic and a few of the other Platonic dialogues.  We covered Aristotle, but I engaged with him minimally.  I was more attracted to existentialism, to questions of free will, but most of all to the role of death in life.  \nAs it should have been, my college years were a time of intellectual development.  Among the more impactful thoughts that occurred to me was a way to prove to my own satisfaction that determinism (or something that could more accurately be termed causal probabilism) was the only logical stance in the free will debate.  This has been of great importance to me and even now remains in my intellectual quiver.  I was never religious, but during this time I became a fervent atheist—a stance I have, given the epistemic limitations of human existence, since relaxed into agnosticism   My other major intellectual/spiritual development resulted from the time I spent pondering death and its implications.  These investigations led me to write my graduation thesis on the topic of Heideggerian thought and Japanese death poetry.  One result of this project was my realizing that to live authentically is to live with death ever in mind.  This too remains with me these many years later.\n	After graduating, I moved to a small mountain town in Japan.  Nominally, I was there to teach English, but my true purpose was development through exploration.  Since that time, I have lived in several areas of Japan and taught every age and ability level of Japanese student. Five years into my time here, I met a woman whom I dated for seven years before we got married.  My marriage has been a profound impetus for personal growth.  So has fatherhood.  My children are now five and two years old.  A boy and a girl, respectively, I can never be good enough for these two tiny people who love me just as I am.\n	Since coming to Japan, my education, both formal and informal, has been ongoing.  I completed a master’s degree in International Education and, subsequently, a Ph.D. in Organizational Systems.  I currently teach at Meijo University in the Faculty of Foreign Studies as well as in a doctoral program at Osaka Prefectural University.  Among my academic interests is the topic of leadership and how it can be taught and trained.  My more general focus has been, and will remain, how to facilitate the development of others.    \n	While I am certain my undergraduate degree involved some study of philosophers who are at least Stoic adjacent (e.g. Heraclitus), I remember quite vividly the first time Stoicism intruded meaningfully into my life.  Around ten years ago, I was listening to a podcast on which Epictetus was being discussed.  The idea that events have no intrinsic quality, but that our judgements determine how they affect us was, for me, a revelation.  I know that I had encountered this idea previously elsewhere, but it was the simple directness of the message and the implied admonition to put it into practice that helped it land with such force.  I formulated it for myself as ‘the only thing that can harm you is your own opinion’ and spread my newfound gospel liberally.\n	I read from the Stoic cannon from time to time, mostly focusing on the Enchiridion and Meditations.  I returned to (or never left) my preoccupation with death, reading and writing extensivelt about the work of Ernest Becker and Terror Management Theory.  I also began meditating daily around four years ago.  I mainly engage in Buddhism-inspired mindfulness meditation but have experimented for extended periods with focusing my meditations on death.\n	Three years ago, my father died.  He was an educator, an adventurer, and a man of principle who made an impression on everyone.  His love for my brother and I was boundless.  While I knew I would lose him eventually, his stature for me was such that, when he died, I lost someone I never really understood that I could lose.  This loss has a finality to it that I still struggle to comprehend.\n	Since finishing my PhD, I have been turned down for more university positions than I can easily remember, many of these coming after I made it to the final round of interviews.  The reasons have varied, but the cumulative effect has been a discouraging one.  After the latest and most disappointing of these, two of my colleagues independently asked me if I was familiar with Stoicism.  My sense is that they themselves have a passing familiarity with it gleaned from the popular resurgence it seems to be making, but it seemed best to interpret this coincidence as evidence that the universe was providing a sign I would be well served to heed.  So, I resolved to dive deeply into Stoicism.  Over the last three months, I have re-read the Enchiridion and Meditations.  To this I have added The Philosophy of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy: Stoic Philosophy as Rational and Behavioral Psychotherapy, The Daily Stoic, much that was written by James Stockdale, and half of Seneca’s Letters.  I journal nightly, reviewing the events of the day, putting myself on trial, and often finding myself wanting.  I intersperse the ‘View from Above’ visualization and the ‘Amor Fati’ aphorism throughout my day, particularly when events are trying.  I recall that my children are not mine but only here on loan, as it where, from the universe.  I make my bed in the morning.\n	The feeling of engaging with Stoicism in this way is that of plunging at long last down a drain I have been circling for years—a cocktail of relief, curiosity, and inevitability.  It would feel presumptuous to say that I consider myself a Stoic, but I am someone on a Stoic trajectory.  Here is why I want to join your program: 1) I want to continually work towards being a better person, 2) I want to achieve a level of understanding that allows me to bring Stoicism to Japan and its education system, and 3) I want to incorporate Stoicism into a book I have been writing on the topic of leadership.  To extrapolate, I am driven towards self-development for my own sake, for that of my family, and because it is a precondition for facilitating development in others.  Stoicism is the best method for promoting such development I have yet found.  I also see an important role for Stoicism at this point in Japan’s history.  The reasons for this are manifold and complex, but the potential is undeniably there.  As a result, I would like to help it find a place in primary and tertiary education, as well as in other non-school organizations.  Finally, and related to the previous reasons, I see the lessons of Stoicism overlapping and reinforcing the best findings in the field of leadership studies, and believe it offers effective, accessible methods that can be applied to the development of leaders and leadership, both of which the world sorely needs.\n	If this essay has been meandering, I apologize, though I would point out that life, while it is being lived, has a strongly meandering quality.  To paraphrase Schopenhauer, it is only in retrospect and past a certain age that life takes on an intentional, narrative quality.  Oddly enough, coming to Stoicism felt, even in the moment, like arriving at a destination of sorts.  It felt like getting to where I was meant to be despite having stumbled there blindly and unaware.  And now I am here.              \n\n\nList of Stoic and Stoic Adjacent Readings:\n\nEnchiridion, Epictetus\nMeditations, Marcus Aurelius\nLetters (half), Seneca\nThe Daily Stoic, Ryan Holiday & Stephen Hanselman\nThe Philosophy of CBT: Stoic Philosophy as Rational and Cognitive Psychotherapy, Donald Robertson\nThoughts of a Philosophical Fighter Pilot (half), James Stockdale\nCourage Under Fire: Testing Epictetus’s Doctrines in a Laboratory of Human Behavior, James Stockdale\nThe Republic, Plato\nThe Trial and Death of Socrates, Plato\nAristotle: A Contemporary Appreciation, Henry B.

I live in Texas, USA. By day, I’m a digital content manager and project manager. By night (or at least until COVID hit), I am an international, aerial burlesque performer and Elvis Tribute Artist. I love animals (vegetarian for 13 years), the arts (literally ALL of them) and my watchmaker husband. I have never had trouble recognizing what an amazingly lucky person I am to do and see the things I have during my lifetime. What I have had trouble being honest with myself about, is my addiction to anger.\n\nMany people say that 2020 was the worst year to have a milestone birthday. You couldn’t go on an epic international trip. You couldn’t even go out for a special celebratory dinner in some places. However, in my case, it was the perfect year to turn 40. I had significantly more time to reflect on who I want to be and where I’ve gotten off track in my personal growth. I was picking unnecessary fights with coworkers I disagreed with. I felt like all of my projects were stalling out. I did not seem to have the skills to cope with anxiety and stress. I was reverting to old habits and giving into the passions of anger and overindulgence to get through the day. Therapy wasn’t really working. Antidepressants weren’t really working. I knew my mindset needed an adjustment or I was going to give myself a heart attack.\n\nAround the time I was having this realization, someone recommended “Think Like a Roman Emperor: The Stoic Philosophy of Marcus Aurelius” by Donald Robertson. I am an unapologetic atheist, but I do think everyone needs to believe in something. My something is believing I can always do and be better. So, I’m a sucker for a good self-help book. Especially if it incorporates ancient history. On my daily walks, listening to this audiobook, I felt so inspired by the lives of Epictetus and Marcus Aurelius. Every day, I would pepper my husband with the things I was learning and how excited I was.\n\nRobertson’s book was like finding a Rosetta Stone for my brain. It was so much easier to look at my reactions to challenges - particularly anger - as passions that I was succumbing to. I’ve always had a sort of debilitating obsession with the concept of justice. His book really helped me to recognize how I was hurting myself by focusing on, and getting enraged about things that were out of my control. Both at the micro (ex. Frustrations with coworkers) and macro levels (ex. Anger about inequities in modern society). It’s only been a month since I finished the book, but I feel a shift in myself and especially how I interact with others. A shift in the right direction. \n\nThe first maxim of ancient wisdom is to “know thyself”. After forty years on this planet, I know that if I never intend on reverting back, I must make a commitment to myself to continue my Stoic education. I’ve been an athlete all of my life. And I know how to commit to a goal and stick to it. For the past five years, I’ve been a professional aerial performer. I know how to build strength and overcome physical pain. I see training my mind as no different than training my body. Applying for this education track will allow me to do that. \n\nAll of my life, I’ve been a little wary of studying philosophy. The idea of sitting around thinking about thinking seemed like the most self-indulgent thing in the world. But discovering Stoicism has shown me that philosophy is not just one thing. And it certainly isn’t what I assumed it was. I came across an article by Ryan Holiday called “A Stoic Guide to Workplace Peace of Mind”. This quote from the article seemed to speak directly to me and how I want to live my life:\n\n“The image of the Zen philosopher is the monk up in the green, quiet hills, or in a beautiful temple on some rocky cliff. The Stoic, on the other hand, is the antithesis of this idea. The Stoic is the man in the marketplace, the merchant on a voyage, the senator in the Forum, the soldier at the front. In other words, they are like you.”\n\nI am a woman of action. Someone who never has let fear, failure, or illness get the best of me. But, I need something more. Something to help me overcome my passions without taking that passion for life right out of me.\n\nAdditionally, Stoicism isn’t just about managing my temper and anxiety. It’s about ensuring I stay healthy. Three years ago, I was diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis. I know that one of the most dangerous things I can let into my body is flare-up triggering stress. I must find a way to manage my stress so I can keep doing all of the things that make life worth living for me. Especially aerial arts and performing.\n\nFinally, I come from a long line of stubborn, angry, mentally unstable people. Watching my grandparents, and my parents, give in to their passions leading to misery and loneliness in old age, have given me another reason to dedicate myself to Stoicism. I know that, left unchecked, these habitual reactions to challenges will not end well for me or those I love. \n\nI know that I am a Stoic. I have overcome many hardships to be the person I am. And honestly, not without much help from others. I know how to survive. I pulled myself out of poverty to become an educated, confident woman with a career I love and a husband who I respect and respects me. I am a Stoic in need of mentorship and lifelong study. I am confident that this program will enable me to live a better, healthier, peaceful, and more fulfilling life. \n\nIn the words of the Mandolorian (another passion I’ve succumbed to during the pandemic)... “This is the way”.\n', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, '', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', 0, 0, '', ''),

I look forward to hearing from you and continuing my study of Stoicism.', 'I am the son of a roofer, and the youngest of three sons. I grew up in Little Rock, Arkansas,  lived there for 40 of my 41 years. Of the things that I could call highlights in my life I have only the basics, marriage, children and work. No grand destiny and no deep seeded internal strife to rage against. I wake in the morning, read books and drink coffee and then settle in at my desk to work on whatever code my employer wants written. My life is a cycle of wake, work, sleep repeated endlessly into oblivion.  \n	 My father was not a kind man, he was hot headed and volatile and my childhood is filled with his outbursts. It is a large part of what brought me to Stoicism in the first place. I carry with me his temper and rage and it is a fire I have been trying to extinguish for a long time.  Not everyone see’s it as I keep it bottled up in public, where having a short fuse has consequences. No, the people who see it are the ones that least deserve it, my family. Mind you, I have never struck my wife or children, ever, I am conscious enough in my moments to maintain at least that boundary. But I have come close to it more times than I would like to admit. But rage takes many forms and the “madness” as Epictetus puts it is not gentle. My words carry more pain than any fist could and my actions harm both myself and my relationships. I yearn for the tranquility that Stoicism offers. \n	I read constantly. I enjoy the quiet moments where I can be absorbed into the pages of books. I found Stoicism by accident through the pages of one of Ryan Holiday’s self-help books about a year ago. Searching for 30 years I managed to find my philosophy of life through the pages of a watered down philosophy cash grab. Irony abounds. \n	It was my first winter in Chicago, I had moved up here ahead of my family and I found myself in an AirBnb in Oak Park sitting on a twin bed in the back room of a little old ladies house. This was 3 months before the pandemic hit and you could still wander into book store and browse titles without a plague mask. Browsing through the titles of an indie bookstore I picked up “The Obstacle is the Way” and that was all there was. My appetite was whetted by the brief mentions of Marcus Aurelius and Co. and the promise of resilience, something I sorely lacked when I moved up here. I quickly found copies of Meditations, The Enchiridion, Senecas Letters, then Arius Didymus: Epitome and Justus Lipsius: Discourse on Human Constancy and Musonius Rufus: Fragments followed. \n	I used to pray for comfort. I knelt at a Baptist altar and gave my life to Christ and even managed to take the customary bath that was involved in all of that. But that was when I was young and innocent. Years of seeing the cruelty and violence in this world have left me at a point where I believe in something greater, but I know its not all-good, all-knowing and definitely not on anybodies side but it’s own. What I believe can best be described as order in the universe. Maybe it’s intelligent but most likely its something well beyond what I could ever grasp, so I try not to worry about it.  I figure whatever is in charge of the Universe cares little for what I think and do. I have called myself Agnostic simply to give it a name, so if you would like a label that one is as close as I can get. \n	On the topic of philosophy I have shopped around a bit. Mostly things which offered some form of control over my darker impulses. Calming mantras, burning incense and odd bouts with various forms of self-medicine. If I must list them, Buddhism, Taoism all had the sirens call for calmness but could never deliver for me. I always assumed because I lacked the discipline to adhere to something so alien to my sensibilities having grown up in Arkansas. At one point I looked at Transcendentalism but to be honest the sheer amount of fluff in the texts prevented me from ever even hoping to absorb the knowledge. Except for Emerson, god I love me some Emerson.\n	I am not a Stoic, my temper and lack of progress would never let me apply the title to myself without a sincere feeling that I had misled someone. To me, being a Stoic is something that almost no one can be without a deep understanding of the texts and the philosophy as it was meant to be lived. I am not a Stoic yet, I want to be however, and in being one I hope to teach others long before 40 years comes upon them. I want to wake in the morning and not fear the daylight. I want to have freedom from worry and freedom from other’s whims. I sometimes feel that I am controlled too easily by others, either by rousing me to anger or playing on my passions and pride.  \n	To answer the final item in the list of things that was needed for this “essay”. What I want from this course is to find structure and formality to my otherwise disorganized study of Stoicism. I want to know the texts and their actual meanings rather than what surface level impressions I get from them. I want to study under the tutelage of someone who is farther along the path than I am. I will close by saying that I am open to learning new things, and in a new light as well. Nothing in me is set in stone and I cherish the advice of wise counsel. I hope that this essay includes everything that was required and I look forward to studying with you. \n\nFor the sake of clarity and being forthright here is a listing of all the books I have read since Nov 2019.\n    • Marcus Aurelius: Meditations, Penguin Classics Edition\n    • Seneca: Letters from a Stoic, Penguin Classics Edition\n    • Epictetus: Discourses and Selected Writings, Penguin Classics Edition\n    • Arius Didymus: Epitome of Stoic Ethics, Edited by Arthur J.

It gave me light in the darkness. I read Epictetus over and over and put an essay to each to clarify my thoughts on each one that I read. After I started to add and implement the advice given by Epictetus . Reading it and implementation is extremely difficult but I did it and I’m better for it . After reading Epictetus I picked up 2 more books by the giants of stoicism Seneca and Marcus Aurelius and learned a lot by getting the old English read books because the directive is stronger to me. The old English gave you exactly what you needed not what you want it also has its romantic sound that is like no other when you read the King James Bible it has a sound of its own when you read old English like the King James it has a sound of its own and it is beautiful.\n       Although it is not easy we have to exercise the body as much as we exercise the mind to prepare ourselves for the future sorrows we must meditate on our death we must meditate on our loved ones death we must prepare for all things that could bring us pain for we know that they are here for a time and then we/ they’re gone. \nWe also should remember the gifts that we have in the future to see sunsets and sunrises as the saying goes it is a gift of life and being able to make the most of the day as if you were to die right now. \n\n\n\n\n      I have a lot of books and the advice from Seneca about having few books by proven geniuses  help me to start my minimalist journey and  I’m thinking about practicing poverty a week a month to remember that things do not stay the same and the same also about life Memento Mori is also to remember that somethings you will only experience once. It is difficult but it prepares the mind the body emotion to go through it with what is in your control and what is not in your control. \n\nMusonius used to test me by saying, ‘Your master is going to afflict you with some hardship or other.’ And when I would answer, ‘such is life,’ he would say, ‘Should I still intercede with him when I can get the same things from you? For in fact it is silly and pointless to try to get from another person what one can get for oneself. Since I can get greatness of soul and nobility from myself, why should I look to get a farm, or money, or some office, from you? I will not be so insensible of what I already own.” – Epictetus\n\nThe books I’ve read or listened to on stoicism has fed my philosophical hunger but I need to work on the discipline of journaling which would improve my daily life. Enchiridion of Epictetus gave so much light  in the darkness I wrote essays on each quote because that’s ultimately how stoicism works . Collecting wisdom daily is a difficult thing to do because we roll in circles of wisdom in other areas of experience is the same in any given discipline.-Stoic hand book touch on the 3 giants of stoicism Marcus Aurelius , Seneca, Epictetus and touches on basics of stoicism along with other stoics that paved the mental road to freedom. Wisdom of the Stoics was also a general touch on the basics. Inner Citadel , this was an audio book for me as I drove back and forth to work and was a mental ear waged on what you allow in your mind and what you don’t allow in your mind .the citadel in war was something that had to be conquered and it’s the same as the mind what you allow to conquer your mind ( inner citadel). Aesop’s fables I consider a stoic book because it gives wisdoms that should be essayed on each one so I get it through and through.\nI would say I’m a theist I have studied the King James Version of the Bible extensively throughout my 30 years of Christianity and God is an active God that touches our lives if you meet him on his terms.study life , prayer life , walk the walk life.\nI’ve been a Christian for 30 years but haven’t been to church in the passed 10 years due to selfishness and family money power within a church . If I were to put myself in a faith it would be Baptist but I’m more of a studying Christian and not attending a sin searching , money hungry church. Stoicism and Christianity have a lot of differences but I also think that they have a lot of similarities in which they are all trying to treat other people better treat yourself better have a better life have a better mindset.\nI haven’t studied any other philosophy except stoicism although I have read some quotes by other philosophy but usually it doesn’t mind map well.\nI consider myself a stoic but specifically a Stoic-Christian because stoicism gives the common sense of life and Christianity touches upon the spiritual life. That is something that has affected me my entire life , life is hard and it’s harder if your stupid  , trying to accomplish this course would help me have a feeling of accomplishment because my life is to busy outside of the internet.\nI’d like to learn how to be a better stoic , how to live a better life from people that have more experienced and that are smarter than me .  They say the best thing about life is giving someone else knowledge that I didn’t have before, if I could somehow give away knowledge that I have acquired through my studies through my belief system my experiences then I am doing what good human beings should do and that is making someone else’s life better.

What you want to get from this course.\nThank you for your consideration and contemplation about admitting me to the College of Stoic Philosophers.  This is an endeavor I have thought about since March of 2020 when I found your program online.  \nMy name is Troy Frostad and I currently live in Yakima Washington.  I have been married for 25 years and have one son who is 21 years old.  \nMy wife and I were best friends in high school and started to date 5 years after our graduation when I was in the United States Air Force.  Being married to my wife is one of my life’s pleasures.\nI was born in Spokane Washington in February of 1969 to an unwed mother who gave me up for adoption.  As interesting as it sounds, I was an orphan for 2 months having no information about the first two months of my life.  I would guess that if it were not for the Catholic Charities of Spokane Washington, that I may not be where I am today.\nI was adopted by a great set of parents and was raised very well.  I never had to sacrifice for anything.\nDuring my sophomore to junior year in high school, I spent the summer on a foreign exchange program (well on my own with a family) just North of Oslo Norway.  I spent 3 months in that country and had a great time.  \nUpon returning home in August of 1986, our family hosted an exchange student from Puerto de Santa Maria, Spain.  He lived with us for a year while attending the same high school.  We became quick brothers and are still very close today.\nAfter graduation from high school, I enlisted in the United States Air Force and was stationed in Montana, served a 4-month tour of combat duty in Operation Desert Storm returning back to Montana.\nIn June of 1991, I received reassignment orders and was sent to Spangdahlem Air Base in Germany.  I spent the next 3 years living in the Eiffel region of Germany.  During that time, I traveled extensively across Europe including Luxembourg, Austria, Switzerland, France, Norway, Denmark, Sweden, Spain and the North African Spanish colony of Ceuta.  I have had experience with 4 different languages (at one time, I was conversationally fluent in Norwegian, German and Spanish).  Unfortunately, I have lost all of that ability as my visits and practice were over 30 years ago.  \nUpon my separation from the Air Force in 1994, my wife and I rekindled our romance and were married in 1995.  \nI graduated from Central Washington University with a BS in Business Administration and currently am a senior executive in an agriculture business.\nThe answers below address the questions from above.\n1.	How long you have been interested in Stoicism?\nI have been interested in the study of Stoicism since my first read of “the cave” by Plato when in college in Germany.  I had an English class where the professor was a philosopher of stoicism where he studied at the exclusive Sorbonne in France.  He didn’t teach us stoicism, directly, but intertwined stoic philosophies into our studies.  It was an interesting course and one that made me think about stoic philosophy.  It was this time that I came upon the phrase from Socrates where he said, “The unexamined life is not worth living.”  This quote really hit home.  This quote pushed me in a lot of areas of my life since.  I was a firearms instructor in the Airforce and I used this quote stating: “The unexamined lesson plan is not worth teaching.”  I have even extrapolated Socrates’ quote further by saying, in a similar vein, “An unexamined leader is not worth leading.”  I have coined this phrase in many different iterations for my family, people I lead and those that I teach.\nMy most recent interest in stoic study was in the summer of 2017.  I had recently entered into a mentoring relationship with an executive business coach.  My coach is very interested in stoicism and directed my thoughts and interests in that direction.  My coach had me purchase the “daily stoic” by Ryan Holiday.  Since then, me and my family read and discuss the teachings.\nI will say that I have been called a “stoic” for many years.  Now, I am sure the definition was misappropriated; however, I have been told that I can be counted on for very wise and calm counsel especially in times of distress.  I try my best to control my reactions knowing that the event that is occurring is separate from my reaction.  That is, I can control the way I respond to any stimuli. \nMy interested was stoked during the first quarter of 2020.  I was working from home and had extra time to read some of the writings of Seneca, Epictetus and Marcus Aurelius.  This is when I found your college of stoicism.  \nSince my executive coaching experience, I have been interested in learning the determinism, self-mastery, virtue and ethics that I see that is lacking in our society.  \n2.  Any books you read on Stoic philosophy. If any, please list them.\nThe books on Stoic philosophy have been Plato, the republic, emphasizing the story of the cave.  In that book, further reading on what it is to be a citizen.\nAdditionally, I have read Ego is the Enemy, the obstacle is the way and the daily stoic all by Ryan Holiday.  I also read a book called, conspiracy, by Peter Thiel.  While not a traditional stoic philosophy book, it is rather clear that Peter was very stoic and able to take down gawker for an expose hit piece on his personal life.  I have also read selective writings of Epictetus, Aurelius and Seneca.  Finally, I have read the stoic handbook by Erik Wiegert.\n3.  Would you call yourself an atheist, agnostic/skeptic, deist, theist?\nI would call myself a monotheist.\n4.  Are you a member of a religious faith? If so, which and for how long?\nI am a member of a religious faith.  I have been…. off and on…. since my catholic confirmation when I was 10.  Since then, I have been a presbyterian and a Nazarene.  At this point, I am not actively going to church.\n5.  Have you studied philosophies other than Stoicism? If so, which?\nDuring college, I took an Asian religion class involving the examination of Buddhism, Confucianism, Hinduism, Sikhism, Taoism and Zoroastrianism.  I cannot claim that I am knowledgeable in any of them.  It was a very hard class and one where the information was like drinking from a firehose.  That class was taken over 25 years ago so I have lost much of the knowledge.\nMy best understanding, from a focused and intentional study is Christianity.\n6.  Do you consider yourself to be a Stoic?\nI would consider myself an “understanding” stoic.  In that, I mean that I have read some books and understand many of the concepts.  I would admit that I have a beginning level of stoic understanding.  However, I believe that I come by stoicism naturally.  The philosophy just makes sense to me.  What I like the most is the underlying and fundamental logic of the thinking.  This is why I want to learn more about stoicism including the finer points of practice.\n7. What you want to get from this course?\nI would like to gain a deeper understanding of the stoic philosophy so I can better integrate the beliefs and practices into my life.  I like to consider myself a pretty reasonable person and one that is very cerebral and a deep thinker.  However, what I also seek is the understanding of self-mastery, ethics and virtue bestowed upon those that study stoicism.\nAs mentioned earlier, there is so much turmoil, dissention and angst in every facet of our lives.  Learning stoicism in a deeper way will give me the tools to navigate and accept what my current life is and to learn how to enjoy life more by focusing on the here and now.\nAdditionally, I am a very type A personality type.  With this personality comes anxiety.  However, I find comfort in the teachings of stoicism by understanding that we are often our worst enemy.   Humans rob themselves of joy from the mental turmoil that goes on inside.  I want to learn to better control that part of my person, my beliefs and behaviors.\nI hope that this short essay is sufficient for entrance into the College of Stoic philosophers and gives the reader a better understanding of who I am and why the study of stoicism appeals to me.\nWarm Regards,\nTroy A.

My interest in Stoicism began in late 2019 when a sober friend of mine introduced me to the book, "The Daily Stoic."  I have continued to read the daily meditations since then, and to apply the principals of Stoicism in my business and personal life.  This is the only book on Stoic philosophy that I\'ve read to date, and I\'m finding that I\'m craving more of the wisdom of acceptance and life principals that are found in it.  Of all the philosophies that I\'ve had a shallow introduction to; none in depth; Stoicism is the one that most stands out to me as a satisfying way to live. I believe that a deeper understanding of these principals will fundamentally change the way I view and live my life for the better.  I was raised Catholic, including twelve years of Catholic school.  Although I imagine I took away some understanding of the better aspects of organized religion, my greatest and most lasting impression of those twelve years is that the god I believed in was angry and unforgiving (I know the church says god is all merciful but I never got that feeling).  I haven\'t tried any other organized religions after my experience in the Catholic church.  I think if anything, my focus has frequently been on the turmoil that has historically been caused by the difference in religious beliefs - not something that\'s ever benefitted me or the people around me.  I also believe organized religions are established more for profit than for helping people.  I guess I am cynical towards them.  I no longer want to argue (even in my head) about the differences between the religious faiths - honestly it\'s just not my business, nor do I understand other religions well enough to really have an informed opinion.  I imagine I\'m a deist, claiming neither a faith nor a disbelief in a god or gods.  I do pray and mediate - practices I\'ve learned in AA (I\'m 19 years sober) - so I assume this means I do believe in the possibility there is a god or gods.  My ability to grasp the possibilities of the existence of god are of course limited by my distracted and limited human brain, so I\'d most likely describe my belief as, "who knows? not me, but prayer and meditation make me feel good and cause no harm so why not?"  In any event, I no longer consider myself a Catholic or part of any religious faith; unless the spiritual aspects of AA are considered a faith.  I believe I took a philosophy class in college but have no memory of it aside from loving the time we spent studying logic (is that a philosophy?). I consider myself a novice Stoic; I believe in the importance of my personal acceptance of every circumstance in my life (macro and micro), and that the only control I may have is only over my thinking (even though sometimes I don\'t even have that).  I suppose I\'m strongest in understanding that the only control in life I may have is over my own perceptions.  I do willingly accept what\'s outside my control; but that may be influenced by my good fortune at being able to live beneath my means and to have been able to pay off my home and car, and put extra money away so that I have no financial worries or fears.  I feel comfortable and secure, and happy to let the outside world fight it\'s battles without me.  As far as directing my actions properly I believe this is an area I am improving and could improve much more.  Until now I\'ve focused on earning money even in a career which was very stressful, required being away from home most of the time, but paid me well.  During Covid I\'ve been staying home and closer to loved ones and I believe this is where I need to be more often.  So I believe I need to make a very important shift in my life and I\'m looking into working my way into becoming a certified drug and alcohol counselor.  To be successful at that I believe I need to develop a greater understanding about living life as a Stoic.  I know that many alcoholics and drug addicts relapse and even die, and to be of maximum help to them I can have no attachments to the results of my work with them; I can\'t afford to take anything that happens personally.  I have come to believe that having a purpose in life; I never felt that I had a real purpose in life before I got to AA, and now having the "stay sober and help another alcoholic" primary purpose in my life is essential to my having a successful life.  I want to learn and understand everything that I can that will support that purpose.  I sponsor a large number of fellow alcoholic\'s and coaching them with the principals of AA and Stoicism has been beneficial both to myself and them.  I want to be able to give them (and myself) more of this great wisdom.  I want to make the way I look at every challenge or issue from a Stoic\'s point of view a muscle reflex; currently I Google individual issues that arise to see what the Stoic point of view is.  I also want to keep my emotional self in check.  I\'ve recently become a single man again, and at some point I\'ll get back into the dating pool and I know that will potentially have some emotional pitfalls and create some desires.  I need to develop a great spiritual state of being in order to keep my priorities straight in my mind and not go chasing off after the wrong types of women that will offer easy comfort initially, and then great pain later.  Even as an example of that, my soon to be ex wife just stopped by my house unannounced to pick up her mail.  During our brief conversation she made a comment that she had a headache.  I asked her if she wanted to come in and lie down on the couch.  She responded that she could use a bit of sexual satisfaction but that it wasn\'t going to happen. \n I, predictably, then extended an offer that she could come by any time she liked, etc., etc., and basically made an idiot of myself due to her not serious offer of sex.  If I was a practiced Stoic, I believe I could have controlled my perception of her initial comment as just a complaint that she wasn\'t feeling well, directed my actions properly by simply saying, "I\'m sorry to hear that; hope you feel better soon;" and willingly accept what\'s outside my control by letting her do whatever she is going to (she\'s going to anyway!), without fantasizing that she was doing it with me (because we already know that won\'t work hence the divorce).

My husband and I have been married since 1991, and we are parents to four adult children who are active in very different fields, from computer science to agriculture and shepherding. \n\nEssay: Know Thyself\n\n«Knowing myself» is an important and laudable goal, but I wonder when I will know that I know myself. I have been trying to answer this question since a long time and have applied various approaches during my life, trying to know myself through searching my innermost workings via therapy – studies in order to learn more – travels in order to put the culture I grew up in into perspective – more studies – attempts to find answers in religion – defining myself in relation to others, and probably more. \nDefining myself through my family, genealogy, family history turned out to be interesting, but even though all this history and all these persons have undoubtedly contributed to what I am now, they are not «me», and I am not my provenance. \nDefining myself through various religions did not work. Up to a certain point I managed to go through the motions, but after that point I noticed that believing and questioning did not correspond. It felt like delegating decisions to some entity that I doubted was even there, and inevitably, other doubts followed. Zen Buddhism could be qualified as a philosophy, but it felt too alien and too rigid at the time I was interested in it. My position towards religion is best described as usually indifferent and sometimes critical, especially if religious persons include me and the whole world in their assumptions and conclusions.\nDefining myself through physical characteristics (fitness, looks, body) worked for some time, but  things change as I am aging, and although my body still is my ally (which sounds weird, as if there are different «mes») it is not like my willpower can rule over the physical. As long as I can lead my life in a healthy way, this is sufficient, and if one day this will change, I hope to accept this and avoid clinging to unrealistic goals. The quality of life is more important to me than the quantity of days i have lived. \nDefining myself through my achievements such as the degrees I passed, the books in my library, the languages I learned, even the happy life I am leading with my husband and our children, are not «me». I enjoy my family very much but am aware of how quickly things can change due to unforeseen factors. And passing a PhD does not make me a better or more intelligent person – I suspected this before but was compelled to go through the process in order to find out that what I had assumed was true.\nDefining myself through the ideas I defend seemed to be the ultimate way. I became an activist for assisted suicide but soon found out that I did not agree with the underlying assumption that it should be in all cases, for everybody. Also, I met several people who seemed to battle for this cause because they wanted to be liked and needed the gratefulness of people they helped. Personal issues seemed to play an important role even here, and led me to distance myself from activism after questioning myself. Did I want to be liked, needed, admired? Did I need people to be grateful? \nI read somewhere that we should just do our civic/social duty. But te next question was of what this duty consists. Is it enough to support small projects close to me? Should I sign appeals on an international scale? Today’s civic duty seems to be complex and linked to filtering a lot of noise. I am still grappling with this point, and maybe one aspect of «knowing myself» is to not get involved in something before thinking through the consequences.  \nUnfortunately, although all these attempts were interesting and provided me with many cherishable experiences, I feel that now in my sixth decade of life, I am not much further than twenty or thirty years ago. At least I realized that defining myself through achievements and doing things for others is closely linked to wanting to be liked by other persons, most of whom are not important for my tranquility. Instead my goal should be to become independent of their opinion of me. \nBesides flirting with religions, I have been interested in philosophy, especially the Stoics and Epicur, for a long time. The works I read, mostly Epicur and Marcus Aurelius, made it clear that I did not need to search for the supernatural in order to find tranquility. I hesitated deciding between the epicurean garden and the centrally located stoa but came back to both again and again. At some point I wondered if taking philosophy courses at university would help me to practise Stoicism, but after some looks into the course descriptions this turned out to be unrealistic. I have read other books on Stoicism, especially works by William Irvine who has done a good job at making Stoicism approachable for the 21st century. \nSince last year, Corona has put a halt to many of my usual attempts to define myself, as there are no more travels, no more gatherings with friends, no more of the social interactions I took for granted. A question came back which I had been pondering from time to time, but just in theory - what if this is all that there is? What if I do not have any more future projects to look forward to – or to divert my attention to, with visions of grandeur? What if I have to continue living my life just as it is now, in a small village with changing seasons, in a house with a garden, with my husband and occasionally our children who come to visit? \nI decided to reframe the Corona pandemic with its curfews and lockdowns as external factors, and comparing the time I spend in my house as being exiled, similar to Musonius or Seneca who were banned to islands. The rational behinde this is that I can complain and wail about the unfairness of all this, which will not help me. I can get to know my circumstances and adjust my thinking to this new perspective: find comfort in what I have, not chase after things that I do not have. Every day I live should not be taken for granted. And everything I have now – my health, my social relations, my possessions - is apt to change («this, too, will pass» is valid for plesant and unpleasant situations alike).\nThis «exile» reminds me of what have been daily living conditions for many people far away and even here, but who we do not «see», like refugees in an administrative center: the uncertainty, the randomness of administrative rules, the being cut off from people we love and from things we cherish. This thought helps me to feel closer to fellow men and look at most particular problems I have as «first world problems», although I admit that I do not always manage to keep this tranquility. This is what I hope to develop through this course – to not only know theoretically the principles of Stoicism, but to apply them in my daily life, to be more tranquil and to develop a philosophy of life in order to use my days wisely.\n\n', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, '', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', 0, 0, '', ''),

In London, I worked as a hospital lodge porter at the London Jewish Hospital whilst we were saving up for the deposit to buy a house. That deposit and house being secured, I undertook a  course of teacher training with a Post Graduate Certificate in Education at the (then) North East London Polytechnic where I specialised in mathematics teaching.\nDuring my first teaching position, at a secondary school (11-18 year-olds) in 1979/80 in London, I received what was probably the best advice I have ever had in my life when my head of department counselled me that a career in teaching computing would be an excellent way forward. This was at a time when microcomputers were just beginning to be affordable for use in education, and I embraced the use of them and the teaching of computer science with great enthusiasm. This was at a time before the Internet, before mobile phones and before the ubiquitous adoption of computing technologies throughout societies. My enthusiasm for all aspects of Information Technology has served me well throughout my life, in both professional and personal contexts.\nAfter three years in that first teaching post where I taught a mixture of mathematics and computing science, I was appointed head of computing at another London school where I taught the same subjects as previously. I was in that position for two years followed by a one year stint at a third school with the same position and teaching responsibilities. After this, I was appointed as head of computing at Davies’ College, London, where I taught computer science exclusively to the 16+ age range teenagers for 5 years. During this time I completed a Master’s qualification in Computer Science. Also during this time I was divorced and remarried, briefly, to my second wife and divorced again.\nWhen Davies’ College closed I was appointed as a senior lecturer in computer science at South Thames College, London (Further and Higher Education) where I worked for 5 years followed by another 7 years at North West Kent College with the same position as previously. During the time I spent in these lecturing posts I was responsible for the development and deployment of many courses at various levels in Computer Science.  I  took early retirement from that college at the age of 55. \nSince retiring I  have remarried again, to my third wife, Susan, who is an extremely talented jazz vocalist, pianist and guitarist. She has a number of very highly reviewed CDs to her name and is held in very high regard by the British press. ( www.suemccreeth.com )\nIn my retirement, I have devoted myself to life-long learning in the fields of computer science, mathematics and physics. I still do some freelance, contract work for the American publishers Manning and O’Reilly for whom I work as a technical proofreader of books in computing subjects in general and artificial intelligence and machine learning in particular. I have also written a published book on the subject of TensorFlow which is a machine software that was developed and is the subject of on-going Research &Development by Google.\nIn January 2020 we moved to Italy as we became extremely disenchanted with the UK due to Brexit and other issues. We live in a small mountain village called Benabbio with the other love of my life, our German Shepherd dog Bella. We live modestly yet comfortably on our teachers’ pensions My wife continues to compose, practice and perform, and I pursue my interests and my work. We are fortunate to have made quite a few friends among the local Italians who have been very supportive of us.\nI have been extremely interested in Stoicism for about a month at the time of writing (13/02/2021). I consider myself, of course, to be very much a Stoic novice.\nI am attracted to Stoicism because of what I understand is its central reliance on logic and reason in one’s mental approach and attitude to life and this accords very neatly with my life’s work and my own proclivities. Another very important reason is that my wife suffers from mental health issues, and I intend my adoption of a Stoic way of live to help me to help her.\nI have been an atheist for as long as I can remember, certainly since my early teenage years,  and I count Richard Dawkins, Sam Harris and Jerry Coyne as significant influences. I am thus not a member of any religious faith.\nI am currently reading:\n*Mastering the Stoic Way of Life by Andreas Athanas,\n*The Beginner\'s Guide to Stoicism by Matthew Van Natta, and\n*Wisdom from Ancient Greek Philosophy by George Tanner\nbut I am dipping into quite a number of other books as well, through Amazon Kindle Samples, such as The Daily Stoic by Stephen Hanselman and Ryan Holiday, in preparation for more purchases as and when I can afford them.\nI have not studied any other philosophies of this nature in any depth, although I have a passing familiarity with NLP, having devoted myself to the study of the fields of computer science, mathematics and physics up to this point in my life. To the extent that this study encompasses some philosophies of science, such as the interpretations of Quantum Mechanics, I do consider myself to be a thoughtful person.\n\nFrom this course, what I want is to:\n*Understand fully what it is to live a Stoic life and to live such a life  to the best of my abilities,\n*Get help in my Stoic studies\n*Get help on my way to understand the Stoic ideal of Eudaimonia\n*Prepare myself for The Marcus Aurelius School,  and last, but not least \n*Help my wife with her mental and emotional life.\n\nI hope you will consider my application favourably.\nThank you\nTony', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, '', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', 0, 0, '', ''),

I am a 45 year old woman living in Canton, a city that is half way between Detroit and Ann Arbor, in Michigan. I am a single parent to an 11 year old child, a one year old dog, a 16 year old cat, and a guinea pig of indeterminate age. We have made our home in a single-family brick ranch on a curved street that doesn’t see a lot of traffic and has a park on the corner with ducks, rabbits, and even a few deer. A handful of state parks are within a half hour’s drive - one is only eight miles away, and we spend a lot of time hiking those trails. \n\nI work as an administrator at College for Creative Studies (CCS), an art and design school in Detroit. The people I work with are generally good. It is a small, private school with a relatively new president. Most of the staff and faculty are artists and designers in addition to being academics, which means that politics and personalities require more energy than they should. I’ve worked there for 16 years and have come up through the ranks to my current position. \n\nMy background is not in art and/or design, though I dabble. I have a BA in English Language and Literature. I continued with a related PhD program for one year. The combination of deep reading Derridean theory and Something Happened by Joseph Heller sent me packing after my second semester. \n\nIn case the person(s) reading this essay are not familiar with the nuances of working in academia, it is difficult to be hired, much less promoted in the field of higher education without a graduate degree of some sort, even for staff positions. This makes sense if you think about it - credentials are the bread and butter of the industry and if the industry’s own people don’t see those degrees as certification of their abilities/validity, why would anyone else? You could liken it to Ford’s marketing team hiring someone who insists on walking everywhere. \n\nI have thought a lot about going back to school over the years, but I have not. Earning a credential to say you have a credential on a resume is never a great plan, especially when you are saving for your child’s credential. And, I have worked with enough PhDs to know that a dissertation won’t make you better at your job. But. . . but . . . I love school. I love learning, just not along the proscribed routes that are required to earn the document. There is nothing magical or “completed” when a person reaches a certain number of credit hours. Perhaps most importantly in this context, I don’t believe that the modern degree prepares you for employment in any definable way, nor do I believe it necessarily should; however, it is a fact that a typical employer will disqualify applicants without the correct credential. \n\nIt is difficult to talk yourself into investing in something that doesn’t feel well thought out.\n \nAll of this is to say that I think about the industry of higher education a great deal given my specific circumstance. What I have come to in my pondering is that higher education needs to be rethought. That is one of the reasons I am applying to your program. Rethinking a system that with such concrete footing requires the kind of clarity that can be found through stoic practices and principles. There is such investment – monetary, emotional, professional, even psychological – in the current paradigm. Offering an alternative will be disturbing, difficult, and invigorating for all involved and will bring to the fore important discussions that have been avoided for far too long.\n\n****\n\nStoicism is a natural fit for me, though it took me more than 30 years to grab hold of it. I grew up with a highly emotive family in which the person who got their way was the one who could induce the most guilt in the other. The whole dynamic freaked me out to the point that I became uber rational as a defense mechanism.\n\nMy adolescence was wayward and led to my joining the military at 17. I planned to become Clarice Starling in short order, so I opted for a military occupational specialty of 97EL, a bilingual interrogator. The Army selected Russian as the language they wanted me to learn and I studied that for a year in Monterey, before moving to Arizona for interrogation training, and then I was permanently stationed in Texas where I spent the remainder of my four years working on Humvees, mowing lawns, and driving commanders around because there was no need for Russian interrogators (Clinton years). \n\nI would point to interrogation training as a particular significant event in my intellectual and psychological evolution. It put into words and lesson plans the things I had learned from my childhood but never reflected upon. The truth can be bent in the service of manipulation. It is also possible, for those skilled enough to do it, to use approaches specific to the individual based on their psychological weaknesses. It was heady stuff for a young adult and started me thinking and discussing ethics in that hang-out-until-midnight-at-a-coffeeshop-discussing-what-you’d-do-if-you-met-Hitler-in-1937 kind of way.\n\nUpon discharge (honorable), I returned to Michigan, went to college, worked in and managed bookstores, taught yoga as a side gig, started and dropped out of grad school, began working at CCS, and married a man with whom I had a beautiful little girl. All of those years sort of run together as I was just living, consistently uneasy but relatively happy, and moving with what every day brought me.\n\nOne of the bookstores I worked in was Crazy Wisdom in Ann Arbor. The store focused on spirituality and I learned a great deal about Buddhism, Hinduism, Wicca, and Judaism from my time there. I was raised lapsed Roman Catholic and had gone through all the sacraments; perhaps because of this, the celebration of life and tradition offered in Judaism is the most attractive institutionalized religion to me, though I don’t practice or attend any church/synagogue. I straddle the line of deist/theist; the side I fall on depends on the day and circumstance.\n\nAs stated earlier, I would also consider the forced reckoning with Derridean theory while in graduate school to be a significant point in my life. The Gift of Death was my undoing. Like the interrogation training, it laid bare the fallacy of a conventional worldview. Derrida’s argument referenced the biblical story of Abraham and Isaac and used it to exemplify his theory that we don’t do things out of a sense of altruism, good will, agape, etc., but because in doing them we gain some other form of stature/power. Yes, I will sacrifice my son, but in doing so, I’ll attain God’s favor, the respect of the community, and so on. \n\nIt was a lot to think about and offered this meta lesson in which I realized that I had, like most, created my own reality based on what was most comfortable for me to acknowledge and live with, rather than going deeper and confronting what was difficult. This brought forward reflection and much discussion related to the validity of societal conventions and agreed upon morality.\n\nLife has a habit of repeating lessons you haven’t learned the first time. When our daughter was one and half, our marriage came to a crashing halt. A couple of rough years followed in which I became absolutely, undeniably aware of two truths: 1. I had ignored what I didn’t want to see and 2. there was very little I controlled. It was difficult. I attended Al-Anon which led to cognitive behavioral therapy and subsequently, a different way of thinking. My interest in the Stoics followed. That was ten years ago.\n\nSince then, I’ve read a lot about stoicism. I’ve gone through several of the Ryan Holiday titles, have read a few “intro to Stoicism” type books, parts of Meditations, and numerous articles/blog posts. Philosophize This!, a terrific podcast by Stephen West, was my go to last summer while walking and I learned a lot from that show about the major philosophers, the order in which they appeared, and how they fed on one another\'s ideas. \n\n****\n\nI am interested in learning more about stoicism and working directly with a mentor who can guide my learning. My hope is that this experience will lead to enrollment in the Marcus Aurelius School. I plan to use what I have learned to positively impact my personal life and to lead much needed change in the education system, bettering the lives of all. \n\nThank you for the time and attention you’ve given to reading this essay.\n', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, '', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', 0, 0, '', ''),

I didn’t care much for philosophy.  I was there for the politics - philosophy, to me,  was at best idle, navel gazing abstraction, and at worst an exclusionary practice used to justify some of history\'s worst atrocities.  I saw myself as a materialist first and foremost, and my participation in academia was a means to an end.  Despite a period of studying Buddhism when I was younger, I believed that political philosophy was far more useful in my goal - helping the people around me.  If I studied political science and theory, and engaged in the vibrant activist and unionist environment around my university, I would be able to help people and make the world a better place.  It was all going so well!  Until it wasn’t.\n	One day, without warning, my world collapsed around me.  I was accused of various ethical transgressions without any opportunity to defend myself - over night I lost almost all of my friends, positions in political organisations, and my mental stability was violently shaken.  All of the things I believed about myself were called into question - what did I stand for?  What did I believe in?  Who ‘was’ I? I drifted around for several months, showing up to classes but being mentally absent, distracting myself with work and hobbies, but avoiding the deep well of uncertainty that was inside me.\n	When 2020 arrived, I found myself staring at my bookcase one day, and a small, cream coloured title caught my eye.  ‘The Daily Stoic’, by Ryan Holiday.  What with it being the start of the year, I figured that there was no better time to start a page-a-day title like this.  From there, I fell down the Stoic rabbit hole - engaging with modern thinkers like Massimo Pigliucci and Donald Robertson, as well as the ancient texts of Seneca, Epictetus and Marcus Aurelius.  What caused me to begin studying this source of practical knowledge, just a few months before the start of a global pandemic, I’m not sure.  Whether it was pure coincidence, a gentle push from the Logos, or something in between, I know that it was very fortuitous!  \n	Over the next few months, I noticed my philosophy holding me in good stead - through the twists and turns of COVID-19, dealing with the enmity of my peers, romantic struggles, and the mundane issues of every day life, I kept coming back to the lessons of the Stoics.  This would broaden my horizons, and open my mind to philosophical practices and texts from all over the world.  From the Bhagavad Gita, to the Havamal, to Vedic ideas of the duality of man to the spiritual and physical training of the Persian Zurkhaneh, a whole new world of insight and knowledge felt like it had been opened to me. \nDespite my varied influences, I still hold myself primarily as a Stoic, philosophically.  I believe that this is due to one crucial reason - it encourages political and civic responsibility and engagement.  Unlike other traditions that encourage total detachment from ‘worldly’ affairs, Stoicism encourages active participation in the polis, doing your best to help your neighbour and sibling.  This encouragement, along with the teachings of the dichotomy of control, lay out a well balanced route for political activism - fight for your beliefs, defend the weak and try to build a better world, but be aware of your relative powerlessness as an individual.  Despite what some modern proponents of Stoicism would have people believe, Stoicism is not a myopic set of ‘life hacks’, or an operating system for maximum efficiency.  It is a philosophy of solidarity, encouraging each of us to be the best we can be, to be better positioned to hold the shield for the next person.\nThere are a few reasons I want to take this course.  Primarily, I want to be able to introduce people to this philosophy that has helped me so much, and if I am to do that, I want to be able to speak authoritatively on it.    By ensuring that I am an active student of Stoicism, I will be able to better answer questions, and help people to find their own path.  I don’t think Stoicism is for everyone, necessarily, but I think a lot of people could find some value in the teachings of the Stoics, and I want to do my small part in spreading them.  Secondly, I want to explore the more theistic interpretations of Stoicism.  When I came into the study of Stoicism, I was a relatively convinced agnostic, and while I still partially identify with that label, I am very interested in the ‘soft theism’ of Traditional Stoicism, and have found comfort in the idea of the World-Nature/Logos.  I would love the opportunity to study these topics further.  Thirdly, I would greatly enjoy the chance to engage with fellow Stoics - it can be rare to find a committed Stoic out in the wild, and I feel that my practice would greatly benefit from dialogues and discussions with other Stoics.  Finally, I believe that it would be a great primer for me to re-engage with the world.  Due to COVID, over the last few months I have been very isolated, feeling like my life is on something of a pause or transitional period.  While I have maintained some aspects of my Stoic practice, I do feel like I am going through the motions in some respects, largely due to the social isolation I am experiencing.  However, with the vaccination program, the end of lockdown looming and a potential new job/move on the horizon, I will once again be out in the hustle and bustle of real life, and I feel like a structured course to reignite my study of Stoicism would be just the thing to prepare me for the challenges ahead.  I also seek to graduate onto the Marcus Aurelius School, and to continue my study from there.\nAt the beginning of this essay, I quoted Zeno,\n\n‘Now that I’ve suffered shipwreck, I’m on a good journey.’’’\n\nAfter going through the most difficult time of my life, and coming out of the other side better for it, this quote speaks to me on a deep level.  I still struggle with the after effects of my ordeal, and myriad other everyday struggles - but Stoicism has given me the tools to deal with them with dignity and strength.  I hope to continue to refine my practice, and to begin studying with the College of Stoic Philosophy in order to better embody the ideals of courage, justice, wisdom and temperance.\n\nThank you for reading,\nMatthew Cowell\n', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, '', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', 0, 0, '', ''),

Sure, I was only four years old and he, ten.  But in that moment while watching him do his fourth-grade math homework, I knew those numbers meant something important.  \n\nAs the years went on, he graciously and patiently allowed me to do his homework alongside him despite our six-year age gap, explaining every step in the best way he could. My favorite subject was always math with its concrete rules and objectively verified answers.  As I learned, I began to see math all around me in the every-day world: in the supermarket with my mom as the goods piled up in the cart, at the gas station with the meter ticking off the gallons, and at home as I bizarrely measured the volume of rainwater coming out of the downspouts (I did this somewhat obsessively one summer).\n\nAs I went through junior high and high school, my mathematical leanings found a better outlet as I discovered a love for science - math with a purpose!  I was a very social person in high school and not particularly bookish, but chemistry and physics were the classes where I always did my homework and studied the material thoroughly.  I wanted to know how the world and the universe worked. This became a religion of sorts for me.\n\nI was born into a casually practicing Catholic family but discovered through the catechism that the Catholic doctrine did not speak to my inner soul and mind.  Although I completed all major Catholic sacraments of youth (baptism, first communion, confirmation), in my mid-teens I drifted away and began forming my own path of belief.  I progressed from theism to deism to agnosticism, which is where I have ultimately settled; that the existence of a supreme being is unknowable.  This is where science fills in the holes for me.  With each discovery, each new generally accepted theory, they unlock for me another small piece of the puzzle of this strange and wonderful existence.\n\nMy college years were a jumble of many jobs and academic starts and stops.  I paid for my own college and vowed to do so without student loans.  Therefore, I only took classes when I had the money to pay for them.  Sometimes I took one class at a time while working full time and sometimes I took a full load of classes while I worked in the evenings.  It was not always well planned out.  There was a certain aimlessness to my pursuits.  Not having enough worldly context from which to focus my efforts, I followed my own curiosities in both work and study.  I ultimately completed a Bachelor of Science degree in Physics, but I also took a lot of courses in a variety of subjects that simply interested me regardless of specific degree quotas.  This is perhaps why it took me eight and a half years to acquire the necessary graduation requirements and why I finished with many more credit hours than needed.  The result of all this academic wandering was three additional academic minors in Math, English and Philosophy.\n\nI found myself drawn to philosophy as it fit very well with my drive for deeper knowledge and understanding.  Among the courses I took were Logic, Ethics, and the Philosophy of Science (of course).  I also read a considerable amount from the teachings of the fathers of Western philosophy in Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle.  I believe that these years in my twenties, with the wide variety of jobs and life experiences, school courses, and reading with intent were years of particular significance in my personal development.  These were years where I learned not just a great deal about the world and human existence, but also a greater understanding of myself and my place within the world.  I exited my twenties feeling largely whole and with a good sense of self.  \n\nLike many, I have experienced a range of ups and downs.  Life can throw us all manner of circumstances.  Since those developmental times in my twenties, I have married and divorced, have traveled extensively, have had career challenges and triumphs, and have lost loved ones to sickness and tragedy.  While the road has had its share of bumps, the navigation was certainly steadier because of all that I had learned.  My discovery journey in the first thirty years of my life was vital in handling those challenges with rationality and aplomb. Now in my fifties, it is hard for me to separate all that I have learned from who I am.  Much of what I learned, especially the philosophy, is absorbed into my being; a permanent and silent capability to be used in the appropriate moments.  However, I still have much to learn.  It is in this context that I seek admission to the School of Essential Studies at the College of Stoic Philosophers.\n\nI have never studied Stoicism, nor have I read any books on the subject.  If it were not for my girlfriend’s interest in the subject, I probably would not have delved into it as much as I have.  As I learn more about Stoicism, I realize that I have been living my life very much in the ways of a Stoic.  This makes me want to learn more.  I have always been a seeker of knowledge.  However, I find myself more and more seeking wisdom.  I believe that studying Stoicism will help me with that aim.\n\nI do not have any particularly grand designs of how I will use Stoicism.  I do know that it will help me process the world in a different and better way.  We all have people in our lives that we lean on for support, encouragement, and guidance.  At times I am that person for some of the people in my life.  There are many times where I wish I knew exactly what words to say to give someone adequate perspective; to give them a small nugget to build a solution around.  My hope is that with a study of Stoicism that I will be a better partner, a better friend, and a better citizen of the world.\n', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, '', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', 0, 0, '', '');

My early journey into Stoic philosophy has already been an impactful one in my life and how I live it. What follows are the key moments from my early life to the present day and my current status as a new student of Stoicism.\n\nEarly Life\nI was born on July 6th, 1960 in Anchorage, Alaska.  I am the second son of my mother and career Air Force father. I spent all of my pre-college years traveling the globe as we were assigned to new posts every three to four years. In my first eight years of life, I attended six different schools, moving between stations in Alaska, California, Georgia and then back to California. During these years I became well acquainted with adjusting to new places and new friends. I was fortunate to have a big brother with me as well, having a constant friend on our travels. During this time, my father was also deployed to Vietnam twice, and this experience taught me much about being self reliant and how important it is to help others. My mother of two young boys expected us to pull our weight. It is these early experiences that I attribute to my future careers in vocations that serve the greater society. \nAs I reached eight years of age, we travelled to a new duty station in England. Being in a new country was a wonderful time for my family and I. We were all together and explored this beautiful land whenever we could. This timeframe began my life long appreciation for history. \n\nPre-Teen Years\nReturning to the United States, my early teens were spent in New Mexico and here is where I remember trying new things and recognizing the changes in myself. I was active in Boy Scouts, sports, band and school. I became aware of my sexuality as, for me, girls became far more interesting. We welcomed another brother while there, and it was a time of added responsibility and my first glimpse into the work it takes to care for another person. This time was one of peace and freedom for me, and in my memories, it is filled with exploration of the desert, the mountains, making friends and learning about myself.\n\nHigh School\nWith great joy, we were stationed again to England.  I was fortunate to be able to stay there for all of my four years of high school, not a common occurrence as a military family. Here I was able to continue the exploration of history, take courses in school that challenged me, remained active in Boy Scouts attaining the top rank of Eagle Scout, and participated in wrestling, baseball and football. I was able to travel in Europe visiting Austria, Belgium, and Germany.  Key to this part of my life was my decision to pursue a military career and I made every effort to gain acceptance into one of the military academies. It is here where persistence and preparation paid off. After an unsuccessful initial attempt, I remained in England after graduation working and studying to reapply. I was admitted to the United States Military Academy at West Point the following summer.\n\nWest Point \nMy four years at West Point was  the most impactful time of my life, as I embraced its mission to become a leader of character for the soldiers I would lead. Focusing on mechanical engineering, I also found the other courses very rigorous and engaging. Subjects such as phycology, economics, law, military history, philosophy, physics and chemistry pushed my mind. They also taught me the value of time as the sheer amount of work was daunting.  The concepts of honor, duty and country were forefront in all facets of life there. I also made lifelong friends there that have endured both joys and tragedies. It was an experience that truly helped form my character, and, although I would fail many times in the following years, I have this short moment in my life to use as a compass. \n\nArmy Life\n I began my Army career going to the Infantry School and then on to Aviation School where I became a helicopter pilot. I also got married and began a family, having three sons, now all grown with families of their own. During my military service, I learned so much more about leadership and grew as a person a great deal. I commanded many young soldiers and felt the weight of responsibility that comes with the possibility that it was my job to send them into harm’s way. It was in this job that I saw for the first time how brief life was, as I witnessed the aftermath of the dangerous life I had chosen. I recognized that I might not return home every time I flew a mission. This was reinforced when I deployed to combat. I remember clearly the day I moved in my mind from the invincible soldier to the mortal soldier. I have prepared for the end of my journey since that day.  \nAfter a final assignment back into the United States, I found that I was drawn to a different path, that of teaching. I was not aware enough, however, of my true interests. Half heartedly and following the path that others thought would be best for me, I left the Army to pursue work in manufacturing. Many parts of life took a turn and I found myself shortly thereafter, divorced and unemployed. It was at this moment I took the chance, enrolled in a local college to study education and applied to a school as a teacher’s aide. \n\nTeaching\nI was hired as an aide and worked teaching reading while I attended classes in the evenings to become certified as a teacher. Due to my background, my principal asked if I would apply for a temporary license to teach as the science teacher in our school. I jumped at the chance and was able to teach full time while completing my program. I have worked at this same school for the last 22 years. My time as a teacher has allowed me to pass on to hundreds of young children more than the ability to complete the basics of math, reading, writing, science and social studies. It has allowed me to be a small part of the growth of their character with a hope that they will be good people well beyond the years I get to spend with them. The work is fulfilling, challenging, and rewarding. I plan to continue the work for many more years. \n\nStoicism \nIt was during this final phase of my life, about five years ago, that I became interested in Stoicism. I had remarried, and thought of my life as going well. My wife at the time, however, found she would rather be with someone else. I quickly found myself emotionally vulnerable and not well equipped to deal with this twist of fortune. I dropped into a depression and attempted to cope, but knew I needed to get some help. It was an ad for a medallion that was inscribed “Memento Mori\'\' that drew me to the Stoics. I looked into its meaning and there was an instant connection in my mind and the type of knowledge I could use to improve my life. Through the website, The Daily Stoic, I signed up for emails and followed their advice about learning more by reading the works of the three Roman Stoics - Epictetus, Seneca, and Marcus Aurelius.  I have since read Meditations, Enchiridion, and am currently reading Letters from a Stoic. Additionally, I have read How to Think Like a Roman Emperor, by Donald Robertson, The Practicing Stoic: A Philosophical User’s Manual by Ward Farnsworth and The Daily Stoic by Ryan Holiday. I listen to podcasts on Stoicism at times, and in fact learned of this school after listening to one that featured Dirk Mahling from the faculty. I have not studied another philosophy prior to now beyond my undergrad course and, although raised going to Protestant services,  I do not consider myself a member of any religious order.  I would consider myself a deist and being good and doing good by others as my duty. As I have continued to study and think more deeply about myself, I do feel as if I am a Stoic, although a neophyte Stoic at best. Through this course I want to look more deeply into this philosophy, become more comfortable with the main tenets of the practice with a goal of doing more than connecting quotes from Marcus or Seneca in my conversations, but to speak this philosophy in my own words, and find areas where I can improve. So it is with a touch of irony, that in conclude with a passage from Seneca I just read recently that captures my goal. From Letters from a Stoic, Letter XXXIII: “To remember is to safeguard something entrusted to our memory, whereas to know, in contrast, is actually to make each item your own, and not be dependent on some original and be constantly looking to see what the master said.” \n', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, '', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', 0, 0, '', ''),

How long you have been interested in Stoicism.\n\nI’ve been committed to the Stoic practice that entails the dichotomy of control by identifying what is within our power and what is not for 4 months (when I was first introduced to the practice through the “Stoicism on Fire” podcast by Chris Fisher). I’ve been on diligent to give, or not give, my assent to impressions and desires as they come. It has helped me identify exactly what and how much is outside my control. Through this process, and by stripping my impressions of value judgments, I have experienced the inner peace and acceptance I’ve been trying to find. \n\nI have been desperately looking for meaning, purpose, and understanding in life for the last seven years. Walking the Stoic path as outlined in Chris Fisher’s podcast has been exactly what I needed at just the right time. I understand what Marcus Aurelius was expressing when he wrote this:\n“Everything suits me that suits your designs, O my universe. Nothing is too early or too late for me that is in your own good time. All is fruit for me that your seasons bring, O nature. All proceeds from you, all subsists in you, and to you all things return.” (Meditations 4.23)\n\n2.	Any books you read on Stoic philosophy. If any, please list them.\n\nI’ve not yet read any books on Stoic philosophy, but I have listened to Chris Fischer’s “Stoicism on Fire” podcast 3 times in the last 2 months and I’m halfway the fourth time. I’ve also read the Wikipedia page on Stoicism that was recommended on the college’s website. \n\n3.	Would you call yourself an atheist, agnostic/skeptic, deist, theist?\n\nAfter listening to “The Religious Nature of Stoicism - Episode 15” from Stoicism on Fire by Chris Fisher, I have a renewed desire to believe in the existence of a God who exercises providential care for the universe. I was born into Christian belief, but turned agnostic as I started to sense a misalignment of Christian theology with the nature of reality – my observations and experiences did not match what Christians were teaching. I left the Christian church seven years ago and have been comfortable to say that when it comes to the existence of a god, I didn’t know. I would typically became wary and skeptical of anyone claiming to understood or know anything about anything in that regard, but this podcast has put together a lot of missing pieces of the puzzle. And deep down… I knew. I could sense it – what is described in Stoicism as our inner daemon. I can sense the divine fire that lives inside.\n\nSo while I still think that some things are unknowable, I know IT’S here and there, everywhere and everything. I also think it is unnamable and beyond our ability to comprehend. \n\nThe little bit of teaching on Stoic spirituality/physics has been so profound and enlightening for me. Some time ago I had concluded that “philosophy” is not a topic of intellectual study or something that can be discussed – philosophy is what we do and how we live. It can be my personal philosophy to study ethics or it can be my personal philosophy to BE ethical. I was surprised to see this exact concept front and center on the Stoicism Wikipedia, “Stoics thought the best indication of an individual’s philosophy was not what a person said but how a person behaved.”\n\n4.	Are you a member of a religious faith? If so, which and for how long?\n\nI was raised in a traditional Baptist Christian household and community who raised me to believe that it was my life’s calling to pursue a life of ministry - to introduce as many people to Jesus Christ as possible and to be a spiritual “shepherd” who gathers and protects all of the “lost sheep.” At 18 years old, I went to college to study Christian Ministry to become a pastor and was involved in local church operations 7 days a week. I was completely engrained and consumed by what Christians call “The Gospel” and living a life that had eternal meaning.\n\nI left the Christian faith 7 years ago because I think that they have strayed so far from what it means to live a spiritual life and I no longer agree with the beliefs/teachings that they consider to be dogmatic.\n\n5.	Have you studied philosophies other than Stoicism? If so, which?\n\nI have taken a philosophy class in college that covered a variety of philosophies. I also have a friend who applies and lives by Zen philosophy and is a current college psychology student (we have interesting discussions about philosophy and psychology), but I have not studied any others in great depth. \nI have, however, studied all things Christian (theology, exegetics, history, pastoral care and leadership, preaching, evangelism, etc.).\n\n6.	Do you consider yourself to be a Stoic?\n\nYes.\n\nA Stoic is someone who applies Stoic theory as a way of life. It is not an intellectual pursuit, and it is definitely not a means for achievement. A Stoic is not marked by belief, but by the commitment to developing a virtuous character through assent, desire, and action.\n\n7.	What you want to get from this course.\n\nI recognize that I could self-study and find plenty of information scattered around the internet. But I am looking for more. I want to learn the art of living from other Stoics and I want to join the Stoa. I want to live a life of virtue and character. I want to be an effective part of the whole and pull my weight. I have been living in defeat from misfortune and tragedy, dragging my feet, hanging my head, and rejecting my fate for the last 7 years. Stoicism was introduced to me at just the right time and has shown me the way.\n\nBecause of Stoic practice, I have found more humility, understanding, gratitude, courage, trust in providence, and resilience in the last 4 months that I have ever experienced in my entire life. \n\n*Please send Chris Fisher my gratitude for creating the Stoicism on Fire podcast\n', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, '', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', 0, 0, '', ''),

I currently live in a small town in Ontario called New Lowell. It is located about an hour north of Toronto and.  I am an only child of parents who met on a blind date, were married within less than a month of meeting, and are still alive and together, happily married to this day. I was born and raised in another small town about an hour and half west of Ottawa called Pembroke Ontario. \n\nAfter graduating highschool, I went to college in Kingston, Ontario and studied graphic design. After college I worked a few jobs here and there and understood what it was to work in the civilian world, which is why I left it and joined the army. Currently I am a military photographer in the Canadian Armed Forces and I love my job. Especially because I can put that graphic design diploma to good use, but also because I am an instructor at the Imagery Technician school at Canadian Forces Base Borden, so I have the opportunity to not only impart my knowledge and experience on to new recruits, but to learn from them as well. And boy do I learn. \n\nWhile on training a few years back I was introduced to the 4x4 box breathing technique. We were told to sit quietly, eyes closed, and our instructor walked us through about two minutes of breathing and visualization. These two minutes changed my life. Never had I ever been so mentally quiet, so calm, so centered. I was so flabbergasted that I had to research this. Much to my surprise, it was a form of meditation that we had done. Who would have known right? This set me onto a path of learning more about it, and digging into the world of Buddhism, Taoism and reconsidering my birth roots of Lutheranism/Christianity.  \n\nI have been to a few Budhist temples in Ottawa in order to learn more. I would probably still be going to them, but the area where I am living has no temples. I enjoy reading books that help me to better myself as a person. I have read many books on Buddhism and mindfulness, which has also introduced me to books on Stoicism. \n\nThe first book I ever read on that hinted at Stoicism was in 2017 The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F**K, which lead to The Obstacle is the Way, The Daily Stoic, Ego is the Enemy, and Stillness is the Key. I have also read smaller mini books on Stoicism and various websites. I have yet to read the key books on Stoicism funny enough, Meditations, Enchiridion, and Seneca\'s Letters. I am currently reading How to Think Like a Roman Emperor by Donald Robertson.\n\nPrior to that I had only heard about Stoicism in passing which included the usual incorrect assumption that Stoicism is about having no emotion to anything. That concept sounded neat but it also sounded weird, in how can people suppress their emotions and why would they? Thankfully that’s not the case with Stoicism. We are all human after all, emotions are a part of the package deal. The trick I think is learning how to work with them.\n\nI write in a journal pretty much everyday. It’s very rare when I don’t write. I am a practitioner of the Morning Pages as found in The Artist\'s Way. I have been doing this practice since 2003 so journaling is a very good friend of mine, and an important one. It helps to put all of those feelings and emotions out onto paper, and help to keep me accountable to myself. I mainly journal only in the morning, however I am trying to micro journal periodically throughout the day as well. I say try because it is very easy to forget to take time to do so when you are caught up in the busyness and sometimes chaos that is conducive to a working environment, especially in the military.\n\nWhy I want to dig deeper into Stoicism inorder to become a better person all around. I used to have anger issues as I am sure most of us have had, but thanks to my morning meditation and journaling, they have helped me to deal with anger and not be as reactive. But there is always room for improvement, and the need, in my case, for constant reminding.\n\n As an instructor and a junior leader in the military I feel I can constantly evolve to better serve those under me, over me, and be a better father and husband. From what I have read about Stoicism thus far, I can see that the application of this philosophy in my everyday interactions can greatly help in my personal evolution. As well, modeling my leadership style after Marcus Aurelius can only bring benefit. I am looking to change my habitual reaction to external events, my impressions of them, and learn to better respond to the unexpected and unknown instead of essentially getting pissed off for basically no reason at all. \n\nAs for if I am atheist, agnostic/skeptic, deist, theist… I believe there is something beyond what is right in front of us, call it God, or the universe or whatever. I reserve that concept for myself to be open and flexible and I don’t get wrapped up in the specific concept of God or Universe or Zeus or the Force or whatever. I don’t have a rock solid belief in just God, or just not God. That being said, I think there has to be something beyond just this. Everything happens for a reason and things that seem random really are not. It’s all cause and effect. Therefore sentient consciousness is a cause of an effect and death is no different. \n\nDo I consider myself a Stoic? Yes, but a Stoic that is a lump of modeling clay that needs help being molded. I also understand that the Stoic path is a constant path of self improvement, learning, and self reminding. If I ever feel that I have reached the end of that path, then I have probably done something wrong. \n', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, '', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', 0, 0, '', ''),

I have moved frequently throughout my life.  We moved from Texas when I was five to Casper Wyoming, at six to Gillette, Wyoming.   In Gillette, I attended five different elementary schools. I the fifth grade I stared playing the Clarinet. I was pretty good at it even though I only practiced 15 minutes a day. At the age of 12 we moved back to Casper Wyo. I attended CY Junior High from 7th to the 9th grade.  In the 8th and 9th grade I was a wrestler.  In the eighth grade, I took an exam and found out that I was delayed. So, they put me into a remedial English class.  The test told them that I read at a 5th grade level with a 6th grade comprehension or visa versa.  When I finished the class, I read at an 11th grade level with a 12th grade comprehension.  By the time I graduated high school, I had attended, from K-12, eleven schools. \n       I graduated High School as an average student.  I didn’t do so well because I had gotten involved with drugs. Half way through the 10th grade we moved to Golden Colorado where I found marijuana.  In the 11th grade they caught me skipping class because I got tired of writing notes to get out.  They told me that if I finished my classes, I could get credit for them.  I took my four F’s and a C, to four C’s and a D.  We moved back to Casper Wyoming for the 12th grade.  \n     The death of my father on my 18th birthday, half way through my senior year, was very hard on me.  I was having problems with reality and this just made it worse.   At this one point in my life, I chose Christianity.  I joined the Mormon church.  For three years I worked at being a good Mormon until I had saved enough money to go on a Mission. I really needed this stability. I felt this was the crux of being a Mormon. I had to go on the mission to really become a Mormon.   I took their exams to help determine where I should serve.  I received a 119 on one of the exams which later I found out was a type of an intelligence test. I went on my mission to Germany and served in Bavaria and Baden-Wuerttemberg.  I struggled with being a missionary.  I tried to memorize scriptures but really couldn’t.  However, I did learn German fairly well.  I can still converse with Germans and enjoy watching German movies.  For many reason and from the experience of a mission, I decided that I no longer wanted to be a Mormon/Christian.  \n      After my mission, I did go on to college and started my post public-school academic career at Casper Junior College, I did a little better; I studied business.   I then went to the University of Utah (U of U) to get my Bachelors.  I chose the U of U because it was fairly close to Casper, I could become an instate student after a year and it had great skiing.   After attending the U of U for a year, I decided I should choose a discipline.  It was then I found out that all of my junior college credits didn’t transfer as anything but empty credits.  I had not finished all of my prerequisites to get into the business college so I chose a make-your-one degree, Bachelors of University Studies with an emphasis in Political Economy in the Humanity school/department.  I had classes in politics, economics, history and international business. I graduated with a 3.15, which is average to me.  I did take a ski instructors course and this is where I learned how to move from being an intermediate skier to become an expert skier.\n       After College at the University of Utah, I joined the US Army as a Crypt-analyst, 98C German Linguist .  I received a fairly high score on the ASFAB; I was in the top 93 percent and that is without guessing on the last few question, 10-15, that I did not answer. Wrong answers did not count against your score. I always seemed to be on the upward path but then I wouldn’t go anywhere. I did enjoy shooting the M16; I shot expert every time.  That may be because, when growing up in Gillette, we shot our BB guns all the time.  I served for four and a half years, mostly in Fulda Germany where I had the privilege of listening to the Fall-Of-The-Wall party in Berlin, November 1989.  I was at a listening post on a hill top, close the border and the Fulda gap.  \n       While in the military, my mother died of lung cancer.  I was called back to the states on emergency leave in November of 1988  She died July of 1989.  I met my wife while on leave taking care of my mother.  We married and she moved to Fulda Germany with her two children.  My son was born September 20, 1990. \n       After the military, I attended AGSIM in Glendale AZ where I received a Masters in International Management. The first semester was very difficult but I got use to the stress. After my Masters, I move to Aurora, Colorado.  Where I attempted to find a career. My first real position was with Samsonite in international transportation, where I was laid off because the company off-shored it’s production and moved it’s corporate headquarters to New Jersey.  \n       After working in Import/Export, I decided to further my international education, I took and passed the Import Customs Broker exam on my first attempt.  Which is exceptional because 96 percent of the people that took the same exam at the same time, did not pass. Many of these people were taking it for the second and third time. I almost didn’t take the exam because I was very sick with a head and chest cold.  I have worked various jobs and am now in purchasing.  My education has not been the key that I thought it would become.  I really didn’t know how to use my education to my advantage.  \n       I have lived the last 28 years in Aurora Co.; where I now enjoy skiing, tai chi, live music, swing dance and my family. I have passed my time and challenged myself mentally by designing and building a potting bench, pergola, gazebo and porch.  I am currently finishing my basement and have installed the plumbing for the whole house filter and water conditioner.  My current project, in line with finishing my basement, is installing a whole-house, tankless water heater.  I am currently in purchasing, not very challenging, at Common Spirit, a non-profit, Catholic based health care provider. Yes, the CEO reports directly to the Vatican. \n       About nine years ago, I was in an accident where I sustained an mTBI.  It was and has been challenging. I kept a daily record after the accident but lost these thoughts when I lost my job because of the concussion; I kept it on my work computer.  I told a neuropsychologist that I was able to overcome my neurosese when I was younger; I can do it again. The lead psychologist talked to me about my youth, parents and siblings not about how I was coping with current life.  They did not believe me that I had a mTBI, since I had passed their cognitive tests with flying colors. \n	A little over a year ago I cut myself and had to go to the hospital to get stitches.  For some reason, I sat in the emergency room for many hours before I was seen to get stitches.  During this time I was reading articles and found one on Stoicism.  It was the last article that I read; in fact, I was reading it when the PA came in to stitch up my injury.  I was intrigued.  I went looking for more information about Stoicism when I found Chris Fisher’s podcasts about Stoicism.  I listened to them all. Joined the Traditional Stoicism Facebook page and found the Traditional Stoicism web site.  From here, I found The College of Stoic Philosophers.  I have hesitated attending the online courses but found the reading list.  I have read J. Sellers, Stoicism; Seneca, Letters from a Stoic; Arrian, The Discourses of Epictetus; and Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, which I found to be poorly edited.  I have read other articles, essays and followed thoughts/posts on the Traditional Stoicism’s Facebook feed. I am not very religious even though I was a Mormon for a few years.  I have not studies other philosophies.  I did take a course on European Intellectual History, studied some logic and read some philosophers works. Do I consider myself a Stoic, good question; If you mean, do I try to live a Stoic life, then yes.   I do try to practice Stoic Ethics, understand the Dichotomy of Control and Discipline of Assent.  I do not yet write my Meditations every day but do write my thoughts on weekends. Through these thoughts, I have begun to Know Thyself.  I wish to learn the basics of Stoicism better/correctly and, maybe, dwell on some deeper thoughts which may enable me to discuss principles intelligently.  Reading these books about Stoicism has been mentally stimulating.  I read the above books and have waited a year so that I might bring something to the instructions and to make sure that is what I want to study. To me, I am ready to move to the next level.

The Stoic philosophers, with their capacity to remain logical and calm in the face of chaos, have proved to be timeless in their approach to conflict. It is this essence that I seek to embody. Although I don\'t consider myself a Stoic yet, my objective is to adopt the Stoic philosophy as a way of life.\n	My interest in the Stoic teachings began early on in my college years. I took a Western Civilization course where we read Marcus Aurelius’ Meditations. I remember it being a powerful read. At the time, I was young minded and didn’t fully grasp the true essence of the philosophy being taught. Perhaps this was due to lack of life experience. Time breeds wisdom. Now, I’m in my late 30’s. I’ve lived and I’ve died numerous times. I’ve shed years and evolved with the change of seasons. \n	As I write this essay, I’m currently going through another remarkable life shift. I’m in the middle of a terrible divorce. And I’m a father to a one year old boy. This is a remarkable moment for me — a battle that will require grit, inner strength, and persistence to overcome. A true test to my human spirit. It is this reason that I turn to the Stoic philosophy with seriousness. In my opinion, the greatest virtue in life is that of a human being’s willingness to reinvent oneself. I’ve come to the realization that life’s obstacles are plentiful, but it’s the way one approaches these obstacles that makes all the difference. This is something that I’m determined to work on and master so I can thrive and excel beyond the burdens of everyday circumstance. I aim to become a Stoic by dedicating myself to studying the vast important texts of Marcus Aurelius, Seneca, & Epictetus and apply their wisdom to my life. After diligent training, then I will feel confident in calling myself a Stoic.\n	My self education is vast. I’m currently reading Letters From a Stoic by Seneca. I’ve immersed myself in various philosophical texts throughout the years ranging from Existentialism to the Eastern Thought of Buddhism and Taoism. I’m an avid reader of fiction, poetry, theatrical plays, film, physics, astronomy, philosophy, psychology, and business. I’m committed to my scholarly pursuits and my creative endeavors. I’m a screenwriter/filmmaker, video producer, photographer, playwright, poet, and short fiction writer. My writing has been published and produced in various capacities. I’ve honed my creative skills from an early age and initially envisioned myself as a Renaissance Man. These decisions directed me down a thorny unbeaten path. A path which I’ve accepted as the only possible route that I could take that would allow me to stay true to my soul. There are hidden messages whispering amongst the golden sunrise and if one’s not careful, they can unknowingly hush these messages and stifle the future, becoming something other than what the constellations called for.\n	I earned a B.A. in Liberal Arts as a Riggio Honors: Writing & Democracy Fellow from The New School in New York City. I received a Certification in Screenwriting for Film and Television at The New York Film Academy. And I hold an Associates degree in Liberal Arts and Sciences from Suffolk County Community College.\n	I’m currently a 3rd Degree Purple Belt in Brazilian Jiu Jitsu at Freedom Jiu Jitsu in Long Island, New York. I began my Martial Arts journey when I was 30 years old as a way to test my character. I’ve been training consistently for over 8 years. Grappling has taught me a lot about my physical capabilities. To be able to control another human being and defend oneself in a real life situation has given me confidence to maximize my greatest individual potential. Brazilian Jiu Jitsu tests my reality every time I step on the mats and ‘roll’ (spar). It has taught me mental fortitude — to survive bad positions and face hardships head on. Brazilian Jiu Jitsu has helped crush my ego. I notice many parallels between Brazilian Jiu Jitsu and the Stoic mindset. There’s a dualism between the two that I wish to explore in greater detail. 			  	\n	My life has always been rooted in spirituality. Regardless of religion, I feel connected to some sort of higher power. Of course, growing up in New York as an Italian-American, I was pushed into the Catholic religion from an early age. This laid the groundwork for my belief in God. The fundamentals of a moral high ground was instilled in me. As I grew older, I began to seek out different perspectives. Although, I’m technically Catholic, I don’t subscribe to one particular religion. I believe God is some sort of universal light source that is extraordinarily powerful. To rule out one particular religion over another seems pretentious. Most religions are attempting to achieve the same objective. I’m open to any ideas and beliefs that are sensible. One thing is certain, my faith in a spiritual essence remains in tact.\n	Why am I applying to The College of Stoic Philosophers? As a seeker of truth, I’m looking for an opportunity to grow and expand my knowledge on one of the greatest philosophical movements birthed by the human species. I seek to live a virtuous life and overcome adversity with the strength of logic. What philosophy other than Stoicism offers such a unique framework? This course will provide a solid overview on the entire philosophy. One can’t build a house without a strong foundation. My house will be built over time. It’s exciting that there’s a team of like-minded individuals dedicated to teaching the Stoic principals. I think the program offers an interesting blend of autodidactic study and mentorship. I’ve always thrived in an environment of self study. I possess self discipline and a desire to learn. I believe that I’d be an ideal candidate for this program, as I will have ample opportunity to use the philosophy in practical everyday circumstances. Stoicism is the next step in my progression.', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, '', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', 0, 0, '', '');
